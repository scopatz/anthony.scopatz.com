		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok so Here is the deal:  I have just gotten to Austin and on the drive out here I decided that I would like to start a new LJ and hopefully it won't take the bitter tatse th old one did nor will it end as catastrophiclly as the old one.  In any event, since this seems to be passing around, I thought I'd fill it out.


THE UNCOMFORTABLE SURVEY. (lets see if you can get through it. if not, you're too scared about your past)

-Longest relationship: 2 and a half years

-Shortest relationship: Kerry Vineberg, a quarter and a half.

-How many boyfriends/girlfriends have told you that they love you?: At least 2, no more than 4

-Have you ever thought that you were going to marry the person you were with?: No, Hell No

-Have you ever loved someone so much that it hurt?: No, these emotions don't really work together with me. If I am hurting because of somewhere then I love them less...I think.

-Have you ever made a boyfriend or girlfriend cry?: All of them.

-Have you ever cried over a boyfriend or girlfriend?: Yes, but the tears were lost in the dust.

-Are you happier single or in a relationship?: I am definitely satiated in a relationship in a way that I am not outside of one.  Also, when not in near constant sexually overtoned physical contact I am put in a bad humour.  Some, I daresay most, relationships are not happy.

-Have you ever cheated on a boyfriend or girlfriend?: Nope.

-Have you ever been cheated on?: Oh Definitely.  It seems to be a pattern in fact.  

-What is your favorite thing about the opposite sex?: Estrogen

-What is your favorite thing about the same sex?: Comraderie

-Have you ever had your heart broken?: Yes and it as driven me to drink

-Have you ever broken someones heart?: I think so, In fact I think the only time people walked away relatively satisfied was Kerry Moore.  If not That was definelty the best.

-Talk to any of your exes?: People named Kerry haved turned out top be top of their class.  From their respective schools they are some of the only people I keep in contact with from said schools.  Dionne; No.  Jessie I contacted every once and a while for 4 years or so but we have basiclly fell off by now.  I hope she is allright.  Sydney I trust will get her just returns.  If not by me then by something else. I wish I could say I do not ever intend to talk to her again.

-If you could go back in time and change things to where you could still be with one of your exes, would you?: Hard to say.  Probably not. 

-Think any of your exes feel the same way?: Yes I'd say they all would answer about how I did.

-Do you believe that you are a good boyfriend or girlfriend?: I think I have a good foundation.  I have had enough Experiance to know who I am and what I what out of a relationship, and when to cut it off, and what my faults are and how to manage them.  I tell every new person all of this very early on.  But I have found that even knowing and accepting and haing had the other person know and accept does not mean that the relationship will be successful.  If the other party does not know themselves nor how to change themselves as needed then it is ultimately doomed.  Furthermore these qualities are typically deeply covered up by the other party.

-Have you dated people who were not good to you?: Yes but only Dionne and Syndey.  Dionne I only suspect.

-Have you been in an abusive relationship?: Not physically.

-Name your most memorable ex: The one I most remember is naturally Sydney; The most memorable is Jessie.

-Have you dated someone older then you?: Yes. by about a year.

-Younger? Yes. by about a year.

-Do you regret anything that you have done with a boyfriend or girlfriend?: I assume this means physically.  So no.  Emotionally very much so.  Once again with all of them.

-When is the last time that you were in a relationship? 4 months ago.

-Do you believe everyone deserves a second chance?: Fuck No.  Especially if you are their second chance.

-Believe in love at first sight?: I believe in hottness at first sight.

-Ever dated two people at once?: Not yet.

-Ever been given a promise ring? If this is what I think it is then yes.

-Ever been given an Engagement ring?: No

-Do you want to get married?: Undecided...The Academia makes it hard.

-Do you have something to say to any of your exes? If you are a terrible person, or are dating a terrible person.  Please contact me when you die so I may dance on your graves when you die.

-Ever stolen someones boyfriend or girlfriend?: Nope

-Ever liked someone elses boyfriend or girlfriend?: Sure, almost all of them.  I have yet to act on such carnal desires though.

-Do you believe in true love?: If true means true, unadultered romance then yes, but only in the short term.

-Does heartbreak really feel as bad as it sounds?: Must kill......]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was incredibly nervous and stressful.  We basiclly spnt all day mulling around waiting for the real estate agent to call.   Not that we didn't call him of course.  But the paperwork has been held up on the other peoples end and while we were suppossed to close on friday somehow that got delayed until today, monday.  This again, because they did not finish, was held up until tomorrow.  Now, we are suppossed to meet them, of course, not in the morning but at 2 in the afternoon.  Theses guys are relly lagging and it is pissin' me off.  We arived on Sunday which was a day late.  Now we have been delayed an extra two days while in Austin.  Everyone's nervousness is simply feededing everyone else's.  So moving in to my new place and thus getting situated is now being forstalled until tomorrow afternoon.  Which in all likelyhood means that I won't even get internet by my birthday.  The phone situation at my new place is, believe it or not as complicated as getting the new place.  Everything is a headache.  When it is said that purchasing a home can shave years off your life, I believe it.  Whatever happened o the good 'ole days of homesteading where if you wanted a peice of land you would just kill who was ever on it.  There are some nice houses in The City that I would like...maybe near Golden Gate Park.

Wish me luck tomorrow. (must buy pocketwatch...I am so much less cool without one)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Happy B-Day Daler Mehndi!  (And me too ^_^)

I wish I had permenant Internet at my place rather than sitting in the get this...Texas Frech Bread Co.

IN any event my place for the day are to go to a thrift shop and buy myself a tie and maybe a hat and maybe a vest and definitely a pocket watch if I can find one.  Then I might go to the Sexuality seminar if I can find and do some food shopping and definetly go see a late showing of Snakes on a Plane.  My God I can't escape internet culture even when I don't have internet for a week and a half.  Like this morning I got up and watched AMVs.....]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So here I am again....sitting in the Texas French Bread Co.  This time however, there is a cute girl with blue streaks in there hair.  I really shouldn't say girl since she looks 2-6 years my senior.  However she is busy flirting with an coworker of clear Irish descent. 

Yesterday was kinda a non day, and today is poised to be the same.  I forgot Costco doesn't take credit cards and felt like a big jerk when I had to walk away from my order.

I did see "Snakes on a Plane" However.  Super funny.  It is clear to me that the internet contributions of this movie made it so much better than it would have been otherwise.  Also the main villian looked suprisingly like Eric Ballo and had a simillar weapon choice.  Go Fig ^_^]]></content:encoded>

Hopefully I will have a roommate soon though.  Also the ELO cover band concert I thought I was going to today is actually not until tomorrow which sucks.  Oh well.  I should probably do more chores now like run out and get some groceries and find a telephone...but that is too much trouble isn't it?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So yesterdayevening I dragged myself to this movie called "The Visitors" being shown by the French Alliance.  The movie was really funny.  It is about an 11th (although the costumes were more 14th) century Knight and his squire who want to go back in time to correct a wrong the night did by shooting this barron in the head with a crossbow (he was drugged by a witch).  Instead, of course, they end up in the 20th century.  Very Star Trek.  

However, due to some malfunction they couldn't get the subtitles to work.  But I stayed anyways and watched the whole film.  It is amazing how much information you can still get out of a film even though you can only catch one out of every 20 words and that is "Mossiuer".  

In any event, you should try it sometime...or see that movie.  Either works]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So like today was amazing!  I got not one, but two roommates...which means slightly more for rent.

Their names are Josh and Eliot.  They are the Social networking types.  Not ness. the people I wanna live with my whole four years here, but they Definitely know other people and I will surely be introduced to new and exciting crowds though them.  Very amiable...excessively so even.

In any event, I went to this really cool documentary, once again outside a coffe shop, called "Dildo Diaries".  It was all about the Texas Sodomy and Obscenity Laws.  Better than the film (which was amazing by the way) was the number of drop dead gorgeous girls there.  I litereally could not keep track of the number of women I could easily spend the rest of my life looking at.  There were at least six girls there all with short hair and kinda mousey faces and just beautiful builds.  Unfortunately, I think the hottest one was barely underage as she was also the daughter of the owner of the coffe shop.  There was a girl therewho sat next to me who whore 1920s man wear (stripped pants, white shirt, vest, tie) which I find to be about the hottest thing a girl can put on.  I told her I liked the cut of her jib, and she said thanks and that afterwards she was going to a dressup get togther.  I also thought I saw someone who I have been in coorospondence with on OKCupid at the flick.

After that I came home and my new roommates invited me out to 6th street with them.  I accepted and made friends with Uli, a German Comp Sci person into AI.

All in all, a good night.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<table align="center" cellpadding="20">
    <tbody><tr>
     <td align="center">
      <font size="5"><b>Patriotic</b></font><br />
      You scored 90% US Philosophy, 21% American Pride, 66% Involvement,  and 100% Citizen Status!
     </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>
      This test measured you according to four criteria: Philosophy, Pride, Involvement and Citizen Status.
<br /><br />
<i>Philosophy</i> reflects whether you agree with the philosophical foundations of the United States, such as: liberty, equality, democracy (though limited, not absolute), capitalism, checks and balances, constitutionalism, etc.
<br /><br />
<i>Pride</i> reflects your assessment of the factual reality and history of the United States as a nation. It is your opinion as to whether the United States has been a "good" country and whether it has acted rightly or not.
<br /><br />
<i>Involvement</i> reflects your level of political activism--whether you act to stay informed of what is going on in the world, and what you do on the basis of that information.
<br /><br />
<i>Citizen Status</i> simply reflects whether you claimed to be a citizen of the U.S. when asked by this test.
<br /><br />
It is the opinion of this test that, of these four factors, the only one that matters when it comes to being considered a Patriotic American is one's score in the first category--Philosophy. Therefore, if you scored between 0-33% in that category, you have been rated 'Unpatriotic'; 34-66%, 'Somewhat Patriotic'; 67-100% 'Patriotic'.
<br /><br />
Certainly, the other categories provide interesting information for your (and others') consideration. However, they are not crucial for Patriotism, and they do not necessarily reflect a love, or its lack, for one's country. Regarding <i>American Pride</i>, some people will be surprised that it does not affect the outcome of the test; some people will be upset by this. However, if a person supports every military action the United States has ever engaged in, but does not really support his neighbors' right to live their lives in the ways that they see fit, then they do not truly love the United States. Further, and despite much of the rhetoric some political pundits engage in, a truly Patriotic American can be highly critical of many of the actions undertaken by the U.S. throughout history. Certainly, much of what the United States has done has been done poorly or for the wrong reasons. And while the author of this test believes that the United States has been mainly a force for good in the world (and the most-free, best nation ever to exist), he respects the opinions of those who would disagree with him and fully supports their right to dissent. For that is what America is all about.
<br /><br />
Regarding <i>Involvement</i>, it has been said that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. This is true, however it is also true that liberty means that people can be as involved, or not involved, as they want. Choosing not to vote, while perhaps unwise, is as much an exercise of political liberty as anything else. Certainly, however, a low score in involvement might mean that a person could stand to try to be more aware of current events, or more actively involved in shaping them, because sometimes they matter.
<br /><br />
Regarding <i>Citizen Status</i>, I am certain that many people will believe that to truly be a Patriotic American, one must be a citizen of the United States. However, that is not so. One of the traits that sets the U.S. apart from many other nations in history, is that it is a country not organized specifically around a particular ethnicity, language, religion, culture or common historical origin, but a shared political ideology. The United States is organized around a common love of liberty, individual rights and free expression. This, in part, accounts for the unending stream of immigration starting from the very conception of the nation and continuing on to the present day. In today's United States, there are many thousands who are not citizens, and yet who live in the United States and share its dreams (and many of them will be citizens when they are able). The author would even argue that there are many Patriotic Americans who have never yet even set foot on U.S. soil. There are no requirements of language, skin color, religion, sexual orientation or particular condition of any other personal detail to be a "true American." Just a love of liberty.
<br /><br />
I hope that the test was either entertaining, educational or some combination of the two. I appreciate your taking it. If you have any serious question/comment, the author is always glad to discuss this subject or any other (though please keep in mind my initial warnings--you knew what this test was about when you decided to take it).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Last Post was an OKCupid test I just took.

I thought it was really sad that I (of all people) got higher than 96% on Philosophy.  I mean my god people...that is two standard deviations from the mean.  Maybe it is just that the average person on OKCupid is not all that philisophical...but still, People, come on...care a bit.

This is why I am convinced that we don't live in a true democracy...we don't force people to vote.  So many forms of government just don't transfer very well when you reach a certain number of people.  To retain citizenship you should have to care.  I mean maybe not to Heinleinian depths...but at least a little.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So If you couldn't tell, I was rather disgruntled on Friday.  Only after my last post did I admit to myself that I was actually sick.  My inner ear had been all messed up and I was inflamed underneath my jaw.  I basiclly went home as soon as I could and passe dout for four hours.  I took yesterday off and just played WoW all day.  I know, pitiful.  I was about to go out many time but I was really calling that one in.  Conseqeuntlly, I felt much better today. 

Today however, I have just returned from my 12 hour extravaganda into the world.  First I went to Costco and bought some shelving so I can finally stop living out of boxes for once in my life.  Tomorrow I get to unpack, Yeah!!  It is the little things ya know.  Then I went to Thor's Hammer.  If you are having trouble, this is one of the local gaming store.  There is an open to the public D&amp;D game here.  We ran through the first part of converted 2nd Ed mod. Very fun. Afterwords, Je (pronounced Jay)(from the game) and I went to a pub downtown to watch a free showing of "V for Vendetta".  Suprisingly poingent.  I must say I really liked it a whole lot.  I almost feel bad for saying this beacsue it was such a philisophical film (Aesthetics is Philosophy, Ha!) but Natalie Portman with no hair is Hot.  Hott I daresay.  Hawt!  Ok enough of that.  A lot of interesting moral dilemas with no right answers and a ton of char. development.  The Wisochi Bros.  may be redeemed yet.  It also was funny that the main villan looked a lot like Syd's dad.  Je and I spent the next couple hours walking around downtow.  Had a couple beers.  Good times.  I didnot intend on being out all night but hey, who can deny a fun time.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I went to see Covenant tonight.  I know what you are going to say so I'll start off with "It was THAT bad."  Alright we are now all on the same page.  However, there were some positive aspects which I'll get to later.  To start off with I picked a realitively inocuous seat in the middle.  Three spaces from anyone to the right and pleanty of room on the left.  But No.  Three teenie boppers rolled up and sat right in those three.  Keep in mind that there was pleanty of other room in the thearter.  The one girl to my left asked durring previews for ME to kick the seat of the chair in front of me where a 20ish couple was making out.  I naturally refused and then they said loudly "There will be NO making out durring the film".  Which clearly embarssed this young couple.  They then proceeded to talk the whole movie about how hot each guy was.  What the Hell! 

So if you know nothing about the film know that it was produced by the same people who did "Underworld" but instead of vampires/werewolves, there was a group of four psions who had basicly sworn off their powers.  But no there is a secert fifth psion who comes and obviously wants to kill the main (read most powerful) character.  The last half of the film is those two going Kameha-Meha back and forth.  I expected it to be better than Underworld because frankly Underworld was THAT bad++.  But no. I was wrong.

However, my good friends Myers and Briggs pulled through once again.  To my pleasant suprise out of the four heros, each one displayed obvious characteristics of one of the four temperments, NT/NF/SJ/SP.  The main character, while still kind of a douche was clearly the 'thinker' of the group and gets NT status easily.  The best friend of the MC was the more emotional one and was identifiably an NF.  The one who got his rocks off annoying the main character showed a naturaly tendancy towards ideals matching him as an SP.  Now the last one, the SJ, we didn't see much of.  But this may be the most important aspect of SJness.  They realy don't make good subjects of stories (unless you are Hemingway (which would have made this movie genius!)).  He basicly hung around with the SP and did what the smarter/more charismatic characters told him to do.  At the start of the movie I was hoping that they would do the whole four horsemen of the apocolypse thing...but having identifiable temperment was pretty good too.  In some sense, this even makes CHC movies easier to predict, because you can not only indetify major plot and story elements way before they happen but you can also from scene to scene predict what characters will say to each other.  And since you already know waht scenes there will be.....

There was one line which really took the cake.  A doctor, a medical doctor, you know the kind that know about life forms and all, said this "It is as if she was bitten by hundreds of insects, like spiders."  Now the man on the street might not find much wrong with this peice of dialouge.  But we are discerning here, no?  Spiders are not insects.  At least it was worth a laugh.  There was other stuff wrong with the film...but that took the proverbial cake.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I just submitted my fist YTMND.  You can see it at http://neempwnsnedm.ytmnd.com/  

It kinda sucks I know.  But hey it was my first one, right.  No! The internet is a harsh mistress.  within one minute I got a vote of one star and a comment that said I could do better and recomened an epic sword fight between happycat and the seal.  

Ok so here is the catch.  Even if I spent an enourmous amount of time making such a gif and then putting it together and putting it up there, the likelyhood that someone won't hate it imeadiately is pretty low.  So really, unless you are a genius at starting new fads, I would recomend that you take the hit in the polls and not put much effort into it...or really don't care.  Oh well.  The Intarweb is a cold harsh place...kinda like the real world.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So what was the motto of the 14th annual Viticms of Domestic Violence &amp; Transgender Support Foundation?  

"If you Can't beat 'em, Join 'em!"

Ok Ok, I know, I know, a total groaner.  You laughed on the inside.  So I just got back from Spider House where I went through a cheese shop senario.  I had to order three drinks before they had any of them. But I eventually sat down with my matgerita and settled into rereading Lysistrata.  It is so funny and very interesting.  I had totally forgotten about the part where some of the women initially object to the plan with a series of "What ifs?"  One of them was, "What if they should take it by force?"  To which Lysistrata replies, "Submit, but in a bad grace.  There is no pleasure in that which is taken."  or somesuch.  To my mind that seems like such a sophisticated response.  Not so much in the phrasing of it but more that such a tactic would sucee against the average joe.  

Also one of the footnotes noted that appearently Athens utilized Scythian Archers on their police force!  How Bad-Ass is that?  It almostr makes me wonder if this is a source of Athena's weapon being the bow (probably not, but it is a cute parrallel nonetheless.)

And to contiune the tour of greek women, I saw a couple of girls at the cafe who were clearly proud of their heritage , being from the island of Lesbos.  (Neither of them looked greek BTW)  Most of the time when you see couples in general, one person is hot and the other isn't so much so ya know.  Well these were two blessed girls.  One still wasn't my type but they were evenly matched I'd say.

That is all, as julie would say at the end of her posts.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So this weekend was pretty crazy and I can rant and rave about various people and experiances but I will keep everything clean.

Instead I am going to tell everyone about my supercool HackMaster game.  So I think I mentioned that my campaign had too many players for one game and instead we have formed two parties that will coexist.  Well, it got even wilder.  So we have 12 slots open but a potential 14 players so I am forced to come up with ways to get players to leave the game tactfully!  How nutso is that?!  

The Evil Party is really hyped and definitely my type of role-players.  The party thusfar is made up of one Mute Monk, a Bounty Hunter, a Wild Mage and a Blood Mage.  They are so screwed until they get a Cleric, and they know it.  On the other hand they know they will have to be creative to solve most problems.  Also, It is nice that they all understand that they can't be Stupid Evil and are prepared to rock my socks.  

The good party still needs to get fully up and running but I am hoping to play sometime with them sometime this week.  Their theoretical makeup is a monk, thief, cleric, ranger, and some sort of magic user.  

This Campaign has the potential to be my Magnum Opus.  It would be hard to top this set up.  There is just SOOOOO much fun stuff you can do when yuo are playing one group off of another that is simply not doable with one party.  Also, I am positive that it makes the game much much more interesting for the players since less of the creative output they see is coming directly and only from me.  Also since I am blatantly stealing characters (with justification) from at least 3 other campaigns as initial main NPCs, I am certain that helps increase the creative content.  These players are really in for a treat like no other.  

It is so nice too, being able to design campaigns with contingents.  The sucess or faliure of one party with thier tasks can and will have direct effects on the game world that the other party sees when they play.  In addition, to make things suitable ambiguous, the parties may occasionalyl have the same goal but for different reasons, goals which can only be achieved through their cooperation...which would rock since I am going to give them suitable enough reasons to be enimies.  

And after the goal is achieved...Battle Royale! 

This will be spectacular.  Keeping the parties roughly balanced will be the hard part.  But really if that is the least of your worries, you are sitting pretty.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first five people to respond to this post will get some form of art, by me, that is in some fashion about them. I make no guarantees about quality or type, scratch that , I do make assurances about its quality.  It will probably be poor.  But my love and home-style cooking will go into that art!

The only catch: as with most memes, if you sign up, you really should put this in your own journal as well. Give to receive and all that.

If anyone who is close by responds, the probability that you get preformance art is very high.]]></content:encoded>

So last night when I was at guild (UT Gaming Guild) Steve Jackson himself! walks in and asks if anyone would like to play test some of the games he brought!  Holy Moley!  He brought this really fun pyramid game that was an abstract counting game. 

It turns out that he lives in Austin and is looking for a group to permenantly be his UT Austin playtesters.  How cool is that?! In a month or two we get to alpha test Munchkin: Impossible.

He really is a nice man and cute in that sort of grandatherly way.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Burlesque Show! 

Last night was way too much fun for its own good.  In addition to the normal burlesque show (which had a fair share of tittilation) they also had a bondage act, a fire act and a suspension act.

Oh, My, God, The suspension act was the most glorious and erotic thing I have ever seen in person.  If I could see that every night...

If I could be a quarter of how satisfied I was last night in my normal sexual experiances, I would walk around with a permenant smile.  And that was just watching!!  I go dreamy just thinking about it. 

And hear is the real pop-your-topper.  This was a benifit show that goes towards AIDS research and support in Austin.  So it was Hedonism for a good cause.

Have I ever told you that I love Austin?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I was thinking today that when you move it is almost like restarting your computer, at least if you are running linux.

You reboot your life and in the process of bring up all of the necissary system functions you get little [ok] or [failed] messages and then move on to the next step.  But you really do start from the ground up and as things come on line you feel more and more comfortable with the place.  And I am saying this as a person who finds moving to a new place relatively easily.  

I have observed that my behavior here has been that of making certain goals, achiving them and then moving on to the next goal.    The first was obviously moving in and feeling comfortable and obtaining all of the furniture I need to feel like a 'real' person.  Then, I got my school situation adequately up and running.  The next was finding a group of people to game with.  After that came the establishment of one or two stable friend groups.  Now I am left with two goals that like the gaming group and friend group in some sense run concurrently.  

I must discover what sort of ways in which I wish to improve myself and pursue these in my spare time and I must find a suitable mate for the Austin area.  I hate to chalk things up to chance so I won't.  I figure since my self improvement goals include finding new people to exersize with (which is a shame I left SB since I had found again a good group of people thanks to the Garden Court Apt.) I will do this one first.  This goal should impove my desirability to the potential in theory.  I feel the last system critical function to boot up are always the ones that give you the most trouble since you have already developed something of a routine.  What I need now is perserverance!!!

If this wasn't nerdy enough for you the fact that novell is leaving ReiserFS in the dust really bothers me.]]></content:encoded>

All she was is an Indian Customer Service Representative for Microsoft.  But there was something  hidden, unforseen in her voice.  A certain bubblyness in the way she read me my numbers.  The high frequency with which she called me "sir".  The agony in her being when the first 52 digit number didn't work and we had go through a second set.  In those few moments, I was happy.

I haven't posted in the last couple of days because I have been thinking about all the dead people currently in my life.  Also I have been incredibly busy.  I fankly don't know what I am doing wrong.  I am no longer desperate, just frustrated, so I shouldn't be sending off that vibe.  

I bet it is just that I am male.  Maybe a little trip to Mexico is in order.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok so I met the Austinite group of Cosplayers within 10 min of me going to the Anime Club for the first time.  Nigh imeadiately they decided to go to Karaoke; I was down.  Unfortunately the place we went was 21 and up and we had some young ones with us.  We went to Amy's Ice Cream instead.  To Andrew I am eternally grateful for taking me to AX earlier this year.  I had a common ground with these people in more than just Anime but in Fan Culture as well.  

So at Animes I made what I consider my crowning achievment in my mastery of the English Language. Here goes:

Ice Cream: It is not good to eat it out of a Koan, because it doesn't make any sense.

If that doesn't rock your sox, you need more vocab words.  Structurally it is actually two puns both of which are both true and false statments depending on how you interpret the word Koan/cone.  Oh so much titilation I am dying.  I want this carved on my tombstone.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So this weekend was a pretty little rollercoaster one.  I felt really down on friday because I work had basicly eaten my soul the week before.  Friday was much better though because I met this group of people calling themselves the Austin Cosplay Defense Force.  And low and behold most of them were women! Huzzah!

So life was good and then came Saturday basicly sucked the lifeout of me.  I played HackMaster in the mornign and tried to convince the post office not to send back my package to Houston for the second time to no avail.  Then I went and hung out with Seekatz and Robin and Patrick and had an OK time but was still very stressed and tired and lost what could have been my first win at scrabble.  The only truly good thing to happen was that we went to Dragon's Landing and I *was* going to blow the 50 bucks on the "Game of Thrones" RPG.  However, they where closed and I kept my money in my moment of weakness.  

Sunday was another story.  Sunday, October 29th, was Syd's Birthday.  It is funny how some dates stick with you.  Instead of this being an all-to-gether negative day, though I had originally planned it as such, I choose over the High Holy Days to pursue an as of then unthought of positive path and at that time pursued it.  I was still left with a feeling of axiety.  However, there was a Record (LP. Vinal, etc.) Convention on Sunday and I went.  I spent the money I didn't spend on a silly RPG book on buying records.  Mostly I bought a lot of Zappa and Zappa related material, but I spent a fair amount collecting things that I missed from Syd's modest collection.  Also on Sunday, as some of you may have noticed, I put <a href="http://www.scopatz.com/">my website</a> back on the intar-web-net.  This involved putting it on my new old machine.  I also in this process threw out the old iMac that Syd's parents gave me that I was running my site on formerly.  I also went to Ross and bought some black socks in the stead my white gym ones.  Sunday was very much a day when I replaced things in my life Syd related and thereby replaced her and all-in-all was a positive experiance.  

But Then! Today I woke up and wanted to die and then went and worked for 12 hours.

Tomorrow is a new day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are unaware who Suan Sontag is then I will offer a brief explanation here before moving on the the dare-I-say content of this post.  She was an eminant scholar and otherwise academic person in the 1950s and 1960s.  I found out about her a couple of months ago from Kerry sending me an article which included some of her diary entries.  

The work of that gave Susan her permenant residence in Academe is entitled "Against Interpretation."  Having read this I woud say that it has influenced me as much as other life-changing works fr me such as Socrates' Apology and Neil Stephenson's Cryptonomicon.  "Against Interpretation" deals with one of the previously troubling aspects of my knowledge: Art.  For a few years now I have not ben satisfied with my understanding of Art.  I first realized that I did not understand what Art was about my sophmore year of undergraduate studies.  I thus went around and asked those various producers of the subject what it was.  The answer was consistenly vauge. "It is what I make."  "It is many things to every viewer."  While these may have been true, it is not satifying.  Furthermore, they may not be true.  I felt that for something that has sch effort dedicaed to it for so long, there must be more substance to such a discipline. 

The subtext to all response I ever recieved, even if not explicitly pointed out, was that Art is fundementaly subjective.  A work is produced and even if it portrays one thing and is meant to coax out a certain emotion, it is the viewer, the consumer who always decides what the product yeilds for themself.  Susun Sontag, however, through breif illustration of historical thought, points out that the interpratation of Art is a relatively modern phenomenon.  And even more recently was the advent of Art being self-aware.  That is to say Art is now aware of its own interpreattion and being prodced with the interpretation in mind.  This serves to promote Interpretation's near stanglehold on the whole of Art.  Art is now made to be interpreted.  

Susan Sontag claims that before Art was interpreted and formulated and stylized it was first experianced for what it was.  This still happens.  Whenever one approaches a work of Art, before ones cognative processes are allowed to decompose a peice, on must first experiance it.  

I will now make a leap (which I will take as an axiom, although I am sure there are deeper levels and more meaningful assumptions that can be made).  I invite the reader to recall their Heidegger.  For Heidegger, in a temporally independent universe, dasein was the most fundemantal aspect of an object.  A being's physical existance is what matters.  This is typically thought to be in direct opposition, or at least a passing alternate, to the Aristotillian veiw where the soul engenders the physical existance and renders the world meaningful.  I claim that an existance in a localized region for a finite amount of time is an experiance.  I will make no effort here to back up my claim.

Art as an experiance is aesthetic.  One's perception of a work of Art, while still subjective from the point of view that the veiwer experiances it, is not open to interpritation.  Ms. Sontag points out that some Art is more subject to the rigors of interpreattion than others.  Painting and Literature are among the most interparted works.  Film at the begining and Dance and Orchestral music are some of the less interpreted and much more experiential.  Now, in this age, we can add Video Games as an emerging experiential artform.  As an Art, most video games undergo little to no interpetation, much like movies, and are not treated as art.  I expect that this mentality is changing and that within the next 20 years we will see and to some extent have already seen concepts such as Autuership and possibly even a Classical Japaneese Game come out.

However, other forms of purely experiential art have arisen since the writing of "Against Interpretation."  The advent of Non-linear, Chaotic, and Fractal Mathematics has added art which can be nothing but experiential.  Many people have called various fractals, like the Mandelbrot set and its variotions like the Buhdabrot set, Art.  Let us suppose that such works are indeed art.  If so, then they are certainly not produced by any one person.  This shouldn't bother us since most Art is made by a collective, especially the more technilogically advanced ones.  On teh other end, the fractal art is neither produced by anyone at all!  Instead, the math that forumlates these graphics could have been written down at anytime prior to its initial disover and will remain producable in the same way irrespective of who produces it.  Fractal art is infinitely availible.  

Artists have long claimed that they were merely vessles.  They translate messages the gods gave them into their work.  No wisdom, no interpretation.  They were simply the method used to create; artists were not the creators.  This task of becoming the perfect spiritual medium has now been acomplished.  However, it was not done by an artist.  Instead, mathematics happened to fall on something that was then experianced.  And when this newfound methodology was experianced, it was experianced as Art.  What is more is that it would be proposterous to say that fractals are meant to be interpreted for the same reason that it would be silly to say that experiancing nature is saying something about humanity or any other abstracts.  Nature is real; it is neither implicit or explicit.  Like existance and experiance, nature is inescapable.  There are ways to relate these fundemantals to concepts, but that is beyond my scope here.  What is important is the distinction.    Mathematicians achieved what Art found it couldn't and then abandoned.  However, in this process Math became Art.

To sum up, Art is an experiance.  Since, the time of Susan Sontag, new and different forms of art have been produced.  What is more, these new forms are, while not free from interpretation due to the imbeded mentality of Artists and critics, at least adverse to interprataion for the moment and are free to be experianced in the raw brutality of their own existance.  Art may be free to be what it is.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So a lot happened today-ish.

1) I dropped below the 140 lbs mark again. 

2) I have decided to  get a piercing, finally.  I did some research and found that the official Conservative Jewish opinion on this is that it is not against hallacha http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/teshuvot/docs/19912000/lucas_tattooing.pdf .   I will get said piercing as a reward to myself following the first of the following which comes to pass:
--I hit my weight goal of 132.5 (the midpoint of my 130 - 135 region).
--I finish writing my masters thesis and send it off to the readers.
I hope the weight one comes first.

3) I kinda agreed to do a PhD project that I previously had misgivings about.  It is kinda a continuation of my masters work.  However, I made it clear that I never want to go to Idaho again.  Though I may have to work with the INL people, it looks like it is off to Argonne this summer.  Hello Chicago!   

4) I think I have committed to the Motorcycle Idea.  I am gonna start with the class.  However, I will be so super busy that I won't get a chance to do this until the thesis is in.

5) My thesis should be in and fully written before Thanksgiving! OMG 5.5 weeks....I am so fucked!  Specifically these next two weeks are looking very very bad.  I have to finish a whole huge chunk of research and write two sections of the damn document.  If I ignore you, I apologize.

Much love and sexiness to all. 

The next time you make love to your honey, think of me, please.  The good will will transcend time and space to resonate with the threads of my heart.  My normal approach doesn't work here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know sometimes everything makes sense. There is a concordance, even in chaos, that is understandable and perfect.  The philosopher-king is the master of his surroundings.

But other times, the breaking the shattered. A simple suggestion.  Hallelujah.

A heart turned to stone breaks.  

Knowledge is worthless without understanding.  Information penniless without wisdom.

Why do I revile myself for clutching desperately onto my German heritage?  Why do I want to defend my people?  Why do I betray someone with both choices?

I want to be Holy.  The game in my mind is not holy.  I want it.  I want another transcendence!  Logos is an empty cup.  I want to be holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! I Want It!

Are my movements condemned to be Elysian? The throne is replaced by the kitchen chair, and there is glory in neither life.  

In such purgatory, is any number of generations enough?  Will the wound ever heal?

I, sacred. Hallelujah.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...Has been averted.

I came on here to say that I feel that whenever people have an easy or a difficult way to do things, if they sat down and thoght about the situation, most people will instincually do things the difficult way.  (I am not free from guilt on this)  This is really frustrating me.  

I, as you may know, am having roommate problems and these people make every possible move to put them in my bad graces.  I think they like to see if they can get a rise out of me.  I am doing well to ignore them, usually, to their faces.  However, they are giving me emotional flashbacks to a time when two of my closest friends killed themselves in haste.  I do not need this stress in my life.  I do not need this drama in my life.  I am one of the more reslient people out there.  If I wasn't then I would not have survived.  If I had not come here to Austin, I doubt I would have made it.  I certainly wouldn't have in SB.

I feel that I will always lead an unsatisfied life.  This is positive in the sense that it drives me, it is my method for perserverance in the face of extreme challenges such as Graduate School.  However it leaves me bitter and unhappy.  

I see all of the uplifting posts comming out of Thanksgiving and know not whether this is a sign of a positive turn of events or just more evidence that I walk a seperate path.

In any event, it is likely time that I sought out a therapist again. (note: all paragraphs have started with 'I's.  Signifigant? No; chance.)  All-in-all I am doing ok, this was just a rant.  I am kinda sad and lonely, and The people I know here, don't yet know me well enough to be able to respond well to my disperate moods...well not all of them.  I just want people to play nice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So here I am sitting, In my closet, typing away at the laptop which is perched on top of my server.  

Why am I in my closet one may ask?

Well the simple answer is that I am sleeping in my closet on my fold out bed so as to give Tara her spae on my bed.

Tara made it here for a visit.  We are having a fun chill time here.  She has met mst of my friends so far and likes the ones that I like.  I do believe there is a good group of people here.  Even though I have a ton of work to do , I think I can manage.  

Good Times.  Her visit gies me a much needed reprieve before I diove into the end of the semester.  I'll write more later.  Sleep Well Diary!]]></content:encoded>

Also I took Tara to the Airport this morning.  We had a rocking time at TC's last night.  It was wonderful having her here.  I'll post more details when I am at home.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So it has come to my attention that we have some new readers.  Not entirely unexpected as I added some of them as friends and they in consequence added me.

For the old guard:  These, naturally, enough are my friends in Austin.  I believe some general references have been made to them already.

For the new:  Welcome! This has previously been my place to keep in contact with some old friends.  However, I welcome the new readership and the changes it implies.  If you haven't noticed already, most (half-ish, the other half being babble) of the information is loosely encrypted and intended toward specific individuals with the information capable of decrypting what I have written.  With the addition of you there will likely be some posts directed towards you.  However, now that you are here, any possible post about you will be more obscurely written as to throw you off, if this is the desired effect.  If you manage to decrypt a message, through actual knowledge or a lucky guess or otherwise, and you feel it was something that was not intended for you, then you should pat yourself on the back.  Furthermore, if you do this, you are wholly expected to keep this accomplishment to yourself.  I do not want to hear about it nor field questions on it.  There are other, more time honored ways to get information out of me.  I am beyond the childhood state of directly answering questions about anything other than my many and varied Academic pursuits.  That said, enjoy!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So Kerry did this cool thing where she posted the first sentence from the first post of every month this year.  I figured this would be cute, so I'll proceede hence.

[[...sometime later...]]


However, this made me sound like a terrible/nerdy person so I am going to post the sentence of the last post of each month, December excluded.  That makes this list very short.  You will live.

May:  What a dolt.
June:  Self-Referential of the day: Posting about how stupid it makes a person when they have a Holier-than-thou post, makes your post Holier-Than-Thou and thus you just as stupid.
August:  I mean maybe not to Heinleinian depths...but at least a little.
September:  My HackMaster forums with more info about the game world can be found at http://www.guildut.org/forum/index.php?showforum=39
October:  Tomorrow is a new day.
November:  I just want people to play nice.

See, wasn't that much tamer and more humorous?  Also, less nerdy I warrent (you should have seen it before).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Anarchists should leave my country:

I had this dream last night that featured most of my friends from Morgan Hill.  We were trying to build a pier out of 2x4s ala Jason Christopher style.  Everyone was their current age and in their current relationships (mostly).  I remember swimming around a lot and treading water while Julie Sullivan was there hitting me on the sole of my foot with the nail end of her nail board.  I asked Jason to make her stop after my pleas went unheeded.


The General is still in the fog, however, much more has been revealed.  He no has a map of the area and a fighting chance for some of the company to survive if he can navigate his way out of this gauntlet of woe.  If but only he could read the map.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Five Partner Problem</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This should be taken purely from a mathematical standpoint as I have personally no experiance with any more than 1 other at a time.

The problem, simply stated, is "Assuming that one's brain can only comprehend up to 7 different signals at a time, what is the optimum number of partners in the bedroom?"

For example, say you had a 5-on-1 senario with five partners primarily focused on one other partner.  Let us limit every partner partner to having 6 body parts with which they can contact meaninfully the one partner: their loins, two hands, two legs/feet, and their mouth.  While where on the One they touch may matter for pleasure's sake and for geometry (not two body parts may touch the same part of the subject [an exclusion principle]), the subject may only recive a maximum of seven signals so clerarly one partner is not enough but two is too many.  The 5-on-1 is a complete waste, mathematiclly (psycologically it is likely a home run!). 

To return to the original problem, let us now try to satisfy or at least excite everyone.  This is an 0-on-x senario where x is an element of the natural numbers.  Everyone has 6 signals to give and seven with which to recieve.  For normal 0-on-2 sex (where there are 2 people who both want to be fully satisfied), both parnters are unsatisfied, by one signal for a total of two unfufilled signals.  If you add one to x, then you also add another 6 signals and 7 slots.  Therefore the total number of unfufilled signas is increased by one.  By Induction, 0-on-x sex is always unsatisfying.  Everyone cannot always be happy.

The hunt continues.  Restating the problem, find x and y elements of the natural numbers such that y-on-x minimizes the number of unfufilled slots.  The problem, of course, gets more interesting when you allow the number of slots and signals to varry.  Sadly, that is beyond the scope of this post.

All I know is that I am now wishing I had stayed in my group theory class.

The things I think of in the tub.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The State of Beef:</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alright, so this post is long overdue and my insomnia has gotten the best of me this evening.  Some of you may have been guessing this already, but here goes.  

I have decided to drop the label of nerd.  There exist a field of definitions with a myriad of flowers growing in it for what this word means and its origins [1].  It is further distinguished from the words 'geek' and 'dork', both titles I have never nor intend to hold.  None of these things are for me anymore.

I predict as our generation meta-morphs into adulthood, and more importantly the prior generation (the X-ers), the ideal of Nerd will become mainstream and more accepted in "normal" society.  This is in large part due to the word 'nerd' becoming synonymous with 'technocrat', and technology has always been cool.  The the more we grow up, the more relaxed about what our generations free-time acceptable activities will be.

Nevertheless, nerd is no longer for me.  I made this decision a while ago, but thought it might be a transient response to a former life. I have waited and thought and decided that it is not as transient as some have hoped.  

A specter from one of these past lives once mocked me by saying that my belief in change was ill-founded as I had failed to produce a lasting change in myself.  The funny thing is that many psychologists agree with this [2].  People in the Humanities and Social Sciences tend to believe that, placing mood and other incidental factors aside, one's personality is set from a very early age with possible changes in adolescence.  This scientist screams out that they are simply  making the problem of understanding the the incomprehensible easier by removing any and all time-dependent effect.  This is fine well and good for a base case, but dismissing the problem doesn't mean the concern is illegitimate. 

I believe in change, and believing allows the foresight to harness it.  I also believe in revenge, which is certainly what triggered a lot of this.  In short, however, my methods have improved many-fold since I last undertook a major personal restructuring.  

What I have learned that is pertinent, is that change is more fundamental the longer it takes.  Epiphany is needed, yes, but forcing one's will onto one's environment is a seed that requires the proper care for wholesome growth.  

There will be naysayers who say I cannot do it, that I have already failed.  The will "But you just bout the Diablo box set and the World of Warcraft Expansion, how does that make you less nerdy?"

To them I say that I have, made many friends with and I am related to people in the gaming industry and culture.  For me, this things are simply a social activity which I will be weening myself and others off.  Furthermore, as some of you have pointed out, it is how our generation (as I pointed out earlier) communicates.  I do *not* intend on loosing any friends in this as most of the people I know who style themselves nerds are genuinely good people. 

For me, it is and has been a purely social phenomenon of late.  My heart just isn't in it anymore.  

Additionally, what my heart truly longs for is being interrupted, distracted by the presence of the word 'nerd' in my title.  My wanderlust must take me to my more pure and reasoned pursuits.

This is my choice; I only ask for your acceptance.  I do not judge you for your choices.  Understand that we are all truly individuals and alone.  Please do not attempt to comprehend me through any vector; no good can come of it.

And if you couldn't figure it out, n = 0.[3]

Ok I post this as it is the most nonsensical thing I have ever seen!  I shall dispense now.  

To say Marco would be a lunch lady because he is Italian, is racist.  
Kerry as a cheerleader....hmm.....not seeing it.
While Patrick may have more upper body strength then y.t., him playing football, would onlt happen when Texas freezes over, and thankfully, it has just thawed.  
Garrick as prom queen, I can actually see this.
Robin, while she might cut you in your sleep, not really gang banger material ^_^ 
The next three work.
We all know how goth Julie is.
And Andrew as the class clown will happen when Paladins start sacrificing virgins (they were evil virgins, it's ok) to satisfy their deities ritualistic craving for all-male bukkake orgies with all participants caked in dried blood (provided by said virgin).  True and Holy enlightenment can *only* be attained through the full mixing of humours to show our bodies in addition to our minds and spirits that we are all one and we may thus be freed from our mortal bonds to live a life of purity and faith in the one we call lord.

And if you read that last part, I apologize.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't really know what to post about this evening other than that I feel I should write something.  My research has been all consuming as of late.  I got to take a couple of breaks to play some HM this weekend, but that really wasn't enough.  

It occurred to me today that their exists a tendency for more modern table top RPGs to become more like their computer game counterparts.  

I admitted to myself the other day that I may want kids at some point if only that I would be lonely otherwise.  I still don't see it happening, nor do I necessarily want them.  Right now I should be more concerned about going through the motions of baby making than the accidental products of pleasure.  In truth though, my libido has dropped off due to the stresses at work.  I am sure it will come back as it does when I get more time.  Still, it is disconcerting.

Also, having gone through my "Personality Type" extended epiphany, I now feel somewhat alienated from random contact with strangers because I am constantly trying to determine their temperament without faithful Keirsy in my hands.  People can tell too.  

I just wrote some stuff and then deleted it, because I didn't like it.  $5 to the first person who correctly guesses and posts what it was.  

Oh also I have found a new roommate and she is working out much better than the last all of them ever.  This is good for it means I may have a life.  Huzzah.]]></content:encoded>

Tommy and I lifted weights today.  It was delightful, but boy am I feeling it.  

Additionally, My car is fixed now.  It turned out it was the alternator.  It runs like a dream now and I am quite pleased.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just played around on my LAN with Patrick and Anthony.  We played Diablo II and there was much rejoicing.

We also watched this movie tonight called "But I'm a Cheerleader."  I highly recommend it.  It plays off of many homosexual stereotypes for its humor, but also has some genuinely witty and ironic moments.  Interestingly enough, of the main-ish characters, all of the female characters were white and Christian or defects of that faith.  On the other hand, most of the male characters were not one or both of those.  All in all it was a very cute, feel good movie, as most movies about repressed minorities that I have seen tend to be.  They make their point, which is typically very powerful, but somehow need to justify this by placing the movie in a happier perspective somehow by the end.  Almost every Israeli film I have seen has had a similar format.   "Water" by Deepa Metha didn't do this, but then she wasn't a member of the class who she sought her movie to educate about.  This is likely healthy.  The slice-of-life phenomenon or the  movies about normal meaningless living of normal meaningless people are ridiculous. At least at the end of these minority flicks there is a message of hope.  Furthermore conflict is the life-blood of every story.  Does this make conflict good?  Well, maybe.  But it certainly makes it human.  

In some sense the movie was a coming of age film, which really interests me all the more.  Coming of age films are always about conflict, usually between self-desire and how that fails to mesh with society.  In some sense, this movie was more refreshing in that it was a coming-of-age film about an group of people whom were atypically old.  I personally feel that I am constantly learning and changing and the idea that you have one defining adolescence is kind of a hack job.   Maybe this is true for some people.  Most films featuring similar problems with an older crowd (say a married couple who wants to get a divorce in the 1940s but it is taboo) tend to be much agnstier than their childhood counterparts.  Do adults truly loose this malleability of form or are they just pretending?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well some life happened.  This will be a slice of life post rather than one with a meaning directed at individuals who know who they are or something more philosophical.

Saturday I woke up rather late and then got a phone call from Tara.  She sounds a little on edge with life in San Diego.  She is holding down like three jobs.  It sounds pretty hectic.  I am sure she will make it through though.

I spent the first part of my day cleaning my room and it now looks quite nice.  In all of this I got my website back up.  I have decided it needs a complete overhaul.  

I then did some watercolors which I am quite proud of, but have yet to put on my little board.  One of them, while not being necessarily artistic, satisfies all other conditions that I have for Art.

I then went over to Anthony's and Robin's place and had to beg to slice carrots.  Our nominal purpose was to cook soup and watch "My Neighbor Totoro."  We did and both soup and film were of tasty and supper-b quality.  The movie was pleasant, but certainly not my favorite Miyazaki film.      The company also consisted of Anna, Ashley (who looks very nice with her short hair now), Patrick and much later Alex.  We had a conversation about women and the draft (if it is to be re-instituted).  The female members (sans Robin, who wasn't in the room) of our troupe were very much against a co-ed draft "on biological ground".  Not many equalists in the group.  Somehow this lead to me making a comment about boning grapes, which cleared the room of all women.

On Sunday, I went to "Pan's Labyrinth" with Robin and Anthony and Robin's Madre y Hermano.  It was quite good, if somewhat unsatisfying.  I love the Alamo Drafthouse.

Then I went to the new REI on 6th and Lamar to check it out.  I wanted to look at boats, but was disappointed. 

Next I went to BookPeople, which is right next door, ostensibly to look at the hot girls that work at large independent book stores and find a GLBT/Women/Men Studies book to read.  I was tricked though.  I ended up spending a lot of time flipping through their books in the World Religions, Philosophy, and Science &amp; Mathematics sections before I made it to the GLBT section.  When I got there I found only two books about Bisexuals, the stuff on men largely didn't resonate today, and the most interesting stuff were the books on Techno-Feminism.  I then realized that the questions I wanted answered would addressed in books in the Sociology and Personality Types section.  I was too lazy, however, to go find this section and pick out a suitable purchase.  I ended up buying a book about Chaos.

As it turns out, the hot girl that I remember working at BookPeople when I went there in the holiday season was working today.  She was a bag checker for both times.  In December she wore a canary yellow skirt but today she was wearing jeans.   Apparently, she is going to be going on a first date with someone she has corresponded with online.  It is a roller-date.  That is, they are going to be going rollerskating.  Creative.  So I now know that she is kinda single.  This one is out of my league, but not by much.  More incentive to continue my exercise regime, which I am of course doing totally for my own health.  

The moral of this story is that it pays to listen in on other peoples conversations.

I then came home, and watched South Park and made myself dinner.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I don't really have much to tell or anything to tell to people in such a manner that the information control could be contained.  Maybe I am not feeling creative enough today.

I grew leaps and bounds this week in my study of Chaos.  I have never ever felt so at home thinking about something that people might label difficult.  I see fractals fucking everywhere.  I  always have, but now I think about it.  

Furthermore I found out that the Second Law of Thermodynamics, you know the one that states mathematically how the universe is tending toward states of greater Entropy, is false.  I want to recreate the experiment myself to see.  I have always struggled with this one.  On some level, Existence doesn't make that much sense with this little guy floating around.  Humanity is certainly an orderly force in a spiritual sense if not a physical one. 

Patrick and I argued last night on the benefit of gasified coal plants but not necessarily on the sides you might think.  I, as a nuclear engineer, was for them.  This is because my Prof has taught me the importance of economics.  Therefore I feel that any step in the right direction and you can't expect people to have an overnight transition.  Patrick didn't disagree; he just thinks an instant transition would be best; I don't disagree with that.  Not much of an argument.  

I went to Karaoke last night.  That was a lot of fun.  Not as much fun as sex.

I have been thinking about Jessie lately. If anyone knows where she is please let me know.  I have been thinking about going to Burning Man just to look for her and run into her and then pretend that I hadn't planned it out.  She would know I had.  Mr. Rodgers taught me it is fun to pretend.  

I met a girl the past couple of days who looked like Kerry Prime, but with the right hair color, and who had the fashion sense of Meenon.  It was a pretty spectacular phenomenon.  I wonder would Ryan appreciate that?  I could ask him but Mr. Rodgers taught me that it is fun to wonder.

I have made a little box in my closet.  It is equivalent to a shoe box.  I think I shall go fill it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I will reclaim my life someday...I swear it.

I think I am near rebuilding my life.  Unfortunately, it is not quite my dream home due to budget constraints.  There is no pressing reason to demolish it, but I expect I will have another opportunity come this summer and my impending move to Idaho.  

Knowing that I am near done, I may as well scrap the project and start anew.  

I don't even know how I could possibly say that I was near done; if only you were here to have seen my diminished state at the end of this week.  My brain is dead and my roommate's cat is fucking my ex.  I think I need a new heart.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why is nobody asking the really tough questions with regards to gay marriage?  Namely, Why should ANYONE be allowed to marry? Alright you may call me an extremist.  Why don't we just give everybody who *wants* to marry so bad civil unions.  And they should be happy with that!  Better yet, if I were elected I would give every one a civil onion and then no one would go hungry.  No in all seriousness, by outlawing marriage we can in one glorious moment eliminate the rampant adultery problem we have in this country.  Half of all married couples cheat on their spouse.  I say we get rid of this ancient and decrepit institution and arm the other half.  This is America!  Let us modernize.  Marriage has been around since the golden age of Ur.  Lets put our best minds to work on this problem.  We can rebuild it, innovate.  We have to put our back into this and beat the godless communists before they come up with something better.  They have marriage.  We don't need it.  Let their lousy civilization degrade under the iron boot of MONOGAMY.  

We Shall Free Ourselves from the Shackles of the Europe and their Worthless Traditions.  We Are Strong!  WE SHALL OVERCOME!!

Prometheus has given us the fire; now let us burn down the forest!  Amen.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So Tomorrow I give my presentation.  I may have finally earned a respite at least for a short while.  I need a break as this work has taxed my corpus and psyche so thoroughly  that I am having trouble functions normally now.  

My brief break this weekend consisted of reading parts of Muir's writings on his youth in the bathroom and a LAN party at my house which I gloriously did not have to organize (all props to Patrick here).  Below is hopefully a picture of it.  

<img src="http://www.scopatz.com/pics/livejournal/LANParty.JPG">

More peeps were here.  Who you can see, however, is Sierra on the Left, Anthony's back, Robin on the couch, and then Patrick behind her.  

It was pretty fun but I had to work all the next day.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The one thing I love, above all, about Art is its ability to challenge.  I have recently started listening to some of Neil Young's non-radio tracks and he is spectacular.  Albeit in a different direction, his music is every bit as impossible to wrap your mind around as Zappa's from a musicality standpoint.  When he is making social commentary (which is often enough), it is typically about a more common human experience or is much more direct social justice message than Zappa's immersion into a decadent society that lies and cheats and manipulates the masses.  Interestingly enough, their methodology of taking a well-recognized form of music and running with those themes off the deep-end and adding in a little moral whether you are aware of it or not, is strikingly similar and is not something most musicians do, or artist for that matter.  Listening to the works of their pathos is a far cry from the indulgence in camp of Susan Sontag's world.  Mrs. Sontag is of course correct that I fundamentally enjoy the experience, so I allow myself to continue listening.  I guess what I am trying to say here is that Neil young is really good, and not just because he is really good.  

Worthy of note, also, I went to a Gay hour at a cafe, because one of my friends didn't want to go alone.  The funny thing is that I think I liked the place a bit more than he did.  Interestingly enough, I would say that an unhealthy proportion of the people in there were extroverts: 90+%.  

Valentines day was.  I hardly noticed but I did get some free flowers today from someone who was getting rid of them post-festivities.  

I have been getting excited about a possible Big Bend trip.  I really want to go.  It has been too long.  Oh OH!  I am now officially a member of the Sierra Club.  They are sending me a free backpack.  It should be pretty sweet I think.  

I went to a really interesting seminar today about Ancient Greece, its relevance now, and Western Civilization.  The speaker was amazingly perceptive.  I would have had his babies. He basically made the argument that "western" was geographically independent and has been for 2,500 years as it originally applied only to those on the western Aegean.  It also goes the other way, and claims that countries such as Japan and South Korea are western in every sense of the way he means it.  To illustrate the list of interesting points he made would take longer than his lecture, but suffice it to say that he expressed very well a lot of things about society I had noticed since my Myers-Briggs awakening, which basically amounts to my awareness about systems of people.  

I have now rambled on long enough such that no one will have made it all the way here.  If you have though you can leave a little comment saying "Screw You Scopatz!@!  I should kill you where you stand for saying Guad-a-Loop!"]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Movies are hard to watch. Is there no joy left in my heart?  (&lt;--Not a Rhetorical Question, just tough to answer due to double negative issues.)

It is amazing to me how perceptive some people can be when they are supposedly intent on other things.  This convinces me of their P-nature over their J.  Certainly not the X of some people&#039;s memory.  Also in broaching the issue was very F like, which I believe was decided earlier.  For a sum total of EN(?)FP.

Eventually, I will think up a way to end this post.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I haven't posted in a bit.  I saw Obama speak today at his one and only Texas stop on the campaign trail.  The man had a lot of "kunos", which is an ancient Greek word for cunning that is a common epithet for Odysseus.  It has somewhat negative connotations which is exactly how I am using it.  Obama spoke in a way that way not verbose, and used as few of what Patrick called moderate sized words, and when he did they were ones that every bumpkin in their bumplands would know.  Not such a terrible thing and will certainly earn you appeal to the pleabs.  However, is mannerisms alluded to a personality type that almost implies he certainly know the words he is not saying and that his act is just that.  Even so his speech was certainly well spoken and well worded and crafty.  Ideologically I agree with him on all his main points and it does take strength to say such things.  In my heart of hearts I was hoping for another JFK.  This man is not it.  

The good thing about the rally was not the weather.  It was like 70F and raining.  Still, there was a lot of eye-candy and I did my best to avoid staring, but I forgive myself as I had just finished a blitz portion of my project and have let myself out of my cave.  As a subset of the ocular treats, a disturbing number of them were Duncan look-a-likes.  Fortunately, many of them were clearly lesbians, but that is something that is never all that clear, now is it?  It is almost a reason to become politically active.  Almost.

I joined the Sierra club.  I am not sure if I had mentioned that but I have.  I went to a little meet and greet tonight and it was fun.  Definitely an older crowd, but hey, that is life.  I believe I am one of few people my age who know about it and only because my parents raised me well and I pay attention.  Or at least I used to.  

I met a girl from Hillel this week who is from San Diego by way of Berkley.  I could have guessed that she was from San Diego; she exuded it.  Just something I thought was interesting.  Quaint.

I feel I am months away from any sort of satisfying relationship, if not years.  The way my adviser talks, I will be working like mad for the next ten months, which is fine since I get a lot done.  The prize at the end is a three semester masters.  It will be a challenge, but such a task is always something I am up for.  In any event, I am quite busy.  Furthermore, I don't yet know the type of person here I would be interested in.  What is worse, I am tackling the problem as an engineer would.  Well, that is a lie, I am looking at it as a system's study and seeing society as a fractal (which I swear to you it is!), and trying to (time-permitting) guide my life along a trajectory I desire it to go on rather than letting life run its course.  Basically all this amounts to is me being able to make more informed decisions.  

It is tough to cram a whole week's worth of mumbo-jumbo into a post.

I got a haircut!  People tell me it looks good, but they might be lying.  Erich just said, "You got a haircut." which was an awkward interaction (my adviser, you see).  

I think I am more social than I like to admit.  Maybe I am not a happy person by myself.  Maybe I went with shitty friends for so long that I forgot what it was like to be around people you truly loved and cared for...and then have no time for.  Real life probably lies somewhere in between high school and college.  So much of what I do is fighting a memory.  

A Fez can set me reeling.  And not even a real fez, just a picture of one.  

Work is escapism.  Arbeit Macht Frei.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So my brain just gave out and thus I have decided to make a little post on this Technology thing.

Lately I have been into listening to a variety of extremely simple and cheesy dance songs by the Europop group E-Rotic.  Most of their music is delightfully hedonistic to listen to.  They have their style and they totally run with it, no holes barred.  Most of which consist of the standard techno elements but with slightly less repetition.  They sing almost exclusively about sex with heavy overtones of the female vocalist's moans.  I don't think, and so I have read, that they are native English speakers.  Most of their lines are quite short and contain a lot of rhyme and syllable matching.  For example: "Max don't have sex with your ex, it will make your life complex."  Somehow this endears them to me all the more.   

I think I have also mentioned before newfound appreciation for Blondie.  Normally repeating one's self is a sign to stop...but not I.

I have started eating bulk trail mix that I mix myself from the store.  Sometimes I worry about myself.  Often.  Now I know I am repeating myself.

So yeah, not much is really going on as I spent nearly the entire weekend at home doing work.  I am looking forward to the White Ghost Shivers 1920's concert on Friday.  It should be fun.  I hope I can convince someone to come with me.  I hate going to that stuff by myself.  Also, I have all this 20's aesthetic that is trying to desperately to get out and I have been neglecting it.  The Alamo Drafthouse was showing Battleship Potempkin last Saturday and I failed to leave because I was writing a paper.  

In not totally unrelated news, I have resigned (happily!) to not having much "free" time in the near future in order to do this project that I am on right and do it quickly.  

I worry that I am no longer sending out the right pheromones.  Charles Mingus was a motherfucker.]]></content:encoded>

I hate telling people my major...no one ever knows what to say.  Well, save this one crass Math grad student who said it was a dying field.  

I hope Kerry Prime feels better.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Through a meadow opening in the pine woods I see snowy peaks about the head-waters of the Merced above Yosemite.  How near they seem and how clear their outlines on the blue air, or rather <i>in</i> the blue air; for they seem to be saturated with it.  How consuming strong the invitation they extend!  Shall I be allowed to go to them?  Night and day I'll pray that I may, but it seems too good to be true.  Some one worthy will go, able for the Godful work, yet as far as I can I must drift about these love-monuments mountains, glad to be a servant of servants in so holy a wilderness.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the highlight of my day today was this test I did not take.  To be more illuminating I proctored this exam today for a graduate class I have not yet taken.  I was ostensibly doing research during this time, but more on that later.  I was also signed into my AIM client and I was talking to Meenon.  At one point she said something that made me actually laugh out loud.  Of course all of the studious students vigorously working take a short reprieve to stare at me.  It was most humorous.  

I did get some actual work done, however.  I had been having trouble fitting this data I have to any sort of reasonable function with anything resembling accuracy.  The key however was to take the natural log of the data.  The plot of this oddly enough looked like a log plot which then became a line.  This, of course, let me know that there was both an x dependence and a Exp[x] dependence.  This gave me a general fit which looked like a*x*Exp[-b*x], which worked like a dream.  It was cool because this is not one of those functions that people have a lot of familiarity with and no one looks at its plot and says "Blamb! I know what that is!"  I knew something was weird about it this weekend because it is a monotonically increasing function whose second derivative is zero in two places over our domain.  That is to say that when I plotted the line of best fit, the data crossed this line twice while keeping its positive slope, it is just that the slope changed.  Of course that was just the dependence of the data on one variable.  The other variable was not nearly as difficult.  Right now I am busy recalculating the data adding in a third independent variable.  This will likely take overnight.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I just got back from a nine day long extravaganza of outdoorness.  I managed to visit three of our glorious National Parks in this time, including one that is among my favorites.  Mostly we did hikes that Garrick would have hated but Kerry would have loved.  I had a total blast and I am now depressed to be back home.  For all of its charms, Austin is still a city and unlike Santa Barbara there is no way to pretend it is not.  You can't even see the stars at night.  Here is how the trip went down.

Friday:  I woke up at 5 AM and was on the road by seven with Michael and Patrick.  We reached the Chisos Basin Campground of Big Bend with enough light to set up camp.  We spoke with Bob, the campground host, about acquiring a site the next day.  We made arangements with a funny man for a site for the next day.  

Saturday:  Michael and Patrick and I went on a couple of day hikes.  We first walked the paths around the campground.  We then went down to the Rio Grande Village area of the park and hiked the short but effectual Boquillas Canyon trail where we walked around the banks on the river.  We saw at least four border patrol guards on this trail.  Two of them were mounted.  We then traveled down a rough and tumble, unpaved road to make the hike up the Gateway trail.  The rest of our party, Tony and Sierra and Ana showed up at about Ten O'Clock that night.  

Sunday:  Michael and Patrick and Ana and I went on the Window trail out of the campground at Chisos Basin.  This lead us down the only outlet for water in the Chisos Basin.  It was very pretty and the end lead us out to a precipice that was at the bottom of a water carved canyon whose walls were maybe 20'.  The overlook out onto the desert was certainly one of the best on the trip and definitely the best view per mile needed to attain.  We then went to the Panther Gap visitor center to procure a backpacking permit which had its own intricacies which I will explain later.  We then traveled to the Rio Grande visitor center, ostensibly to see a ranger talk about the Agave family.  However! I totally misread the location and the talk was actually at Panther Gap.  Since we were in Rio Grande though, we just decided to walk part of the Hot Springs trail until sunset. It was very nice.  

Monday:  Backpacking!  So we decided to do the Blue Creek trail and got to know it quite well.  However, all of the primitive sites were taken by the time we arranged for a permit.  But never fear, they gave us something else which turned out to be actually much cooler.  They allowed us to do a thing called zone camping.  This basically meant that we were given a whole area of the park (along the Blue Creek trail) in which we could camp anywhere as long as our site couldn't be seen from the trail.  This meant that Patrick and I got to run a scouting mission for the rest of the party to find a suitable campsite.  We hiked as far in as we could and remain in the zone.  

Tuesday:  The negative part of the zone permit was that we had to eat all of our food each day since there was no bear box, but you know you live and you buy a bear barrel.  This meant that on Tuesday Patrick and Ana and I did a speed run back to the cars.  Ana needed to go to the store so we took her.  We got back to base camp the same time that Michael and Tony and Sierra were packing out.  After Patrick and Ana and I broke for lunch we continued on our day hike.  Our goal was the highest point in the park, Emory Peak at an elevation of 7825 feet.  for starters we set out to finish the climb up the Blue Creek trail which became significantly steeper nigh immediately after our camp.  The end of the blue creek trail meets up with the last mile of the Laguna Meadow trail and ran us right into the middle of the Chisos forest after climbing out of the remnants of a fire from fifteen years prior.  Finishing off the Laguna Meadow trail wee took the Colima trail to cut off the rim trails and go straight to the end of the Pinnacles trail.  About a mile down the Pinnacles trail we met up with the Emory Peak trail and hike to the top in a last grueling leg of the journey.  We reached the peak at about 5:45 pm or about five hours we left base camp.  Believe it or not coming down off the mountain was more difficult than the ascent.  Patrick hadn't brought enough food so was nearly feinting and after the sun set was having trouble retaining his body heat.  He wore an emergency blanket for most of the way down.  Ana had forgotten to pack a coat so I let her borrow mine.  Luckily everyone remembered their flashlights.  The going was slow, however, and we didn't return to base camp until 10 O'Clock.    All in all, this day had a grueling 18.6 miles covered with a total elevation change of 3700 feet over 14 hours of hiking.  

Wednesday:  Ana and Patrick and I packed out and drove to Carlsbad, New Mexico!  We rented a room at a Motel 6.  I recalled a very tasty Italian place from my prior trip and we did find it.  However the establishment was for sale!  I nearly cried.  The restaurant, Pasta Cafe, was closed due to bankruptcy.  Word on the street was that the owner was a cocaine addict.  This night, drinking ensued.

Thursday:  First we went to Guadalupe Mountains National Park and were lucky enough to find a campsite in the Pine Springs campground, which is the only one in the park.  We then went to Carlsbad Caverns National Park for a change of pace.  This visit was particularly neat.  Since the bats were not around at this time of year, the visitors were allowed to hike down into cave through its mouth rather than being forced to take the elevator.   A group of cave swallows greeted our descent.  Returning for the evening to Guadalupe, Patrick and Ana and I saw went to a ranger talk about the Butterflies and Moths of the park.  The ranger, Anne Marie, had taken some of the most beautiful pictures of wildlife I have ever seen.  She was a very skilled photographer.  Patrick and her had a pleasant talk afterwards where they compared cameras and methods.  

Friday:  This ushered in the last major hike of the trip.  Though we got a late start due to some possible car trouble, we did fully accomplish the Guadalupe peak trail.  This trail hikes you up 3000 feet to an elevation of 8749 feet in 4.2 miles to the top of Guadalupe Peak, which is the highest point in Texas.  We were leisurely and tired about our way and the trip took something less than seven hours.  Much of the time spent at the peak was doodling in the log book.  One former hill-topper had written about how he and his party were feeling Mexico and escaped the Zapatistas and were staying there for the moment before hopefully completing their delivery (vital to the revolution of course) to Santa Fe.  Patrick responded by writing an entry that describe how his party had hunted down the rebels using a tip off from the Zapatistatas.  I wrote down the definition for the Mandelbrot set.  Ana wrote "I feel free".  The peak itself had some amazing views.  One could see out over all of Texas it seemed and really understand how it had all been under water.  Luckily we made it back for anger Dave's talk entitled "Island in the Desert" which was all about the three areas of the park.  These areas are namely the desert and the forest and the strange region in between. 

Saturday:  We packed up and drove home.  The trip is over.

Now that I am back in Austin I feel oddly depressed.  The city is not for me.  I can't see the stars at all.  I can't really go hiking.  For all of its charms in the human world, Austin is distinctly lacking in those charms of nature.  Not that it isn't beautiful in its own right.  I do not feel safe here; I do not feel at home.  I do not feel that I could disappear.  The City has gone on without me.  Society continued and left me behind.  The Street didn't care.  The Frost Bank didn't care.  I was here and then I was gone.  Upon my return, nothing noticed.  I am not needed here.  School.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So today I found myself with some excess energy and and time and went for a walk.  I walked down the Shoal Creek trail and down to Town Lake and then back up though the city proper.  Shoal creek is actually quite nice and very close.  I am quite pleased and surprised that I had never been there before.  The connecting trail from Shoal Creek to Town Lake is terrible though and I do not recommend it to anyone for any reason other than that I am pretty sure there are some bats living under a couple of the bridges.  All in all my mood was very much in swing on this trip.  I felt very good about Austin in parts and then disgusted by the metropolis in others.  I would be so much happier on a ranch in West Texas.  I don't know.  Maybe I am one of those few people who doesn't need others.  That can't be entirely true however, as when I am in the city I am very reliant on other people, especially socially.  I could be happy alone on the border between the wild and civilization.  Or with others.  I am fine with loved ones living with me there.  Nothin' too complicated though.  I swear, Austin has been the move that has given me the least access to nature.  Nothing of substance is over the back fence, like all other places I have been, or the really cool places didn't have a back fence.  Maybe I should find a job in Arizona.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Punk is so Rice</title>
		<link>http://scopatz.blog.com/2007/03/27/punk-is-so-rice/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have been thinking a lot lately about Punk.  Even if you don't like Punk read on; you'll come to see that I define it very generally and reach some interesting conclusions.

Punk is like Rice.  Rice is one of those canonical foods that goes well in any culture across a huge variety of foods and tastes.  Indian, Mexican, Chinese, Greek, You-Name-It!  Rice can be bland or spicy.  

Punk is the same way.  Just as that rice is consumed, but rarely a food unto itself, punk is listened to in a similar manner.  It is chameleon like in its genre.  You can add Punk to nigh any style of music and barring one actually getting a better product, you at least get a more poignant one.  

To clarify Punk here extends far beyond what is known as Punk Rock.  Punk is that quality of anti-establishmentallity that forces one to take a more extreme and critical stance on the state of affairs.  This Punk attitude manifests in music as a declaration of free speech and nay-saying of the standard bearers of the formulaic industry.  My claim is that this happens across musical genre lines, just as rice transcends the taste boundaries of culture and location.  

That being said, Punk Rock certainly exists (Punk being an operator acting on the variable Rock).  Punk Rock, like the Ramones, actually suffers from the fact that Rock is so out there and self-critical and campy and fully admits all of these things that there is less room for Punk Rock to comment on Rock that Rock does not already comment on.  Rock already hates itself; Punk is needed.  That being said, the Ramones and other Punk Rock bands make neither great Punk nor great Rock, or are at least limited to good Rock sans the social comentary.

Not far from the Rock Regime, but with significantly less self policing is the field of Surf Rock (Surf Guitar).  A perfect example of Punk Surf Rock are the Dead Milkmen.  Their songs are structurally Surf Guitar songs and they would be well suited if they could play their instruments to a Surf Guitar standard.  

The most interesting variety I have found is certainly the Punk Folk or Punk Country.  This is most fully (and possibly only) engendered by Mojo Nixon and Jello Biafra on their album "Prairie Home Invasion".  In some sense this is merely updated Folk music.  Traditionally Folk is all about the laments of the people in the time that they lived.  These songs, transfered, lost their connotations but retained their charm.  Reappropriating their charms to the modern day we get the same sort of music commenting on the laments of our time.  While I don't claim that traditional folk music (in this country at least) is or was Punk, I do say that the pathos of folk is that of punk. 

As much as he might hate me to say it, Frank Zappa and the Mothers wer very punk in some of the work, especially in their earlier stuff.  but retaining this later on as well.  The vocal songs on Freak Out may be seen as a sort of Punk Doo Wop while other songs of his may be considered Punk Jazz or dare-I-say Punk Classical.  

As a final note, I would also classify bands like Green Day as Punk Grunge and Bad Religion might be more of a Punk version of Metalica which would make them Punk Metal rather than simply being rock.  

The punk message is strong and tasty.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry, If I made anyone feel uncomfortable today.  Today was quick.  I really am not upset at anyone.  

Once again, if you can mention when I bring up accidentally bring up something explicitly that I don't want to talk about this would help me greatly in being able to curb this behavior, which is something *I* want to do.  I, of course, will attempt to do this with out impinging on any of my reserved exuberance.  

I am trying hard not to be lame; please feel free to help in anyway you so desire.  

Thanks for putting up with my antics.  It is total bullshit I know.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was cold today in Austin.  I didn't go outside at all.  Instead I have dedicated this day to hedonism and science.  I finished writing up a lab report that took me two weeks to write.  I learned a lot of Mathematica in this and probably increased my skill level from passing fair or moderate to expert or veteran.  I am still not a Mathematica super-gawd or developer or wolfram clone.  

More importantly than all of that I finally sat down and learned TeX,or LaTeX rather.  Now that I know it, it is the most indispensable piece of software ever written.  GCC and Emerge don't touch this baby.  It is absolutely clear why everyone uses it.  My one complaint is that trying to get figures to do what you want them to is a bit like teaching an ADD child whom is also suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder.  They really want the blocks arranged in a certain position and even when you can convince them that they look better in a different arrangement, they still move them back to where they originally put them.  But literally everything else about writing a paper is made easier.  It looks totally professional and I can write it in nano *GASP*!!!

More importantly than all of that, my family just left town after coming for Pesach.  It was wonderful to have them here and now I am a bit lonely again.  Unfortunately, while my brother did make it into NYU for dance he did not make their academic requirements.  Also despite is amazing audition for Juliard, they also declined his application.  This means he is not going to New York, yet.  He  did, however, make it into both the UCLA and UCI dance schools.  Many congratulations on those fronts are in order.

My lactose free diet is going well, even though I have gone to Amy's twice this past week.  I am simply relegated to eating nothing but dark chocolate for desert...Oh Darn!  Other than that it has mostly been vegetables and eggs since I can't really have any bread either.  Carrots are about the sexiest food in the world.  Move over Cucumber.  Carrots have that nice other-worldly orange coloration and are conical.  You can bisect them with a plane (knife) and learn some math at the same time.  This all reminds me what I came on here originally to say.  Doesn't it suck when you can't even remember your wet dreams?  If you are going to go through the pain of having become that frustrated without release, you might as well enjoy it.]]></content:encoded>

Of course this is all ostensibly under the guise of learning things for school, which is not wholly the case.  

I am hoping the system will not eat me up and spit me out again, but that is what will likely happen when I try to oppose it next year.   

My Awesome Table is in my room. 

I am trying to teach Julian to program.  I think the process will be much speeded up since he finally got his super sweet computer to dual boot Linux and Win XP.  The weapon of choice is, of course, python.  He certainly has a talent for dealing with computers and other algorithmic complex systems like automobiles.  I think this indicates that he is good at modularizing information and processing it quickly.  Hopefully at his young age he'll be able to get past the formalism that is structured programming.  If he does, he'll be golden.  This will lend years of high school for successful development that were not afforded me.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have Friends!

Thanks to all of you who have called or written lately.  I have been negligent.  Do believe that I miss you sorely.  While I am not ready to pull up the stakes and move back to Santa Barbara, however Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, San Fransisco and Irvine, and Three Rivers are all morsels on my tongue, salivating like some pet of Pavlov's. 

Of Course this is all very Catch-22'd since I would then be leaving Austin and the people here I would miss very much too.  Everyone gets their time, Or I get theirs.  You all understand, right....

Loved Ones, Loved Ones. Take the Highway; Park; Come up and See Me.  I'll be Working, Working.  But if you come visit, I'll put down what I am doing; My Friends are Important.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't *have* to be Vegan anymore, But do I want to be?

It was so easy to pretend I was lactose intolerant and use that as an excuse.  But I am not and can now eat all that stuff should I choose to.  

I am so sick of changing diets all the time it is almost worth it to stay where I am.  Also being vegan was much easier than I anticipated.  I still have some of the problems that plague people who live with these restrictions in that it is hard to go shopping for food and furthermore I find it expensive.  I am not sure one's dietary habits should be based purely on what is economical though.  

Also I do not have all the hangups about animal cruelty that most vegans do.  I already am essentially vegetarian.  Furthermore if I was to stay vegan for purity of body reasons, this doesn't quite hold.  While Veganness certainly holds to the Jewish ideals in this matter, Kashrut is not nearly as restrictive as all that even in its strictest sense.  If I was Hindu...

I haven't been having the cheese or meat cravings that I was having initially either. 

So the problem rests that I have no compelling reason to stay vegan but no real reason to give it up either.

What do you think?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Non-Linear Dynamics and Chaos by Steven Strogatz.

This book is much better than I remember it being when I took my class with it.  Mostly because it was supplemental and not helpful to the mathematics being taught in the class I was in.  

However this book and <a href="http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu/research/rddeegan/cornstarch.avi">This</a> movie have convinced me to go back into physics ASAP.  But don't tell anyone.  I still need to make it out of Nuclear Engineering with a degree.  I think the only way to sever ties happily is to convince them that it is best for me to leave.  I kinda don't know how I am going to do this nor exactly how I can guarantee my getting in here at the UT Physics dept.  I have certainly learned a lot in my year off.  Most importantly I have learned that I accomplish much more when I am not in a relationship or near family or any of my traditional distractions.  I think that is why I do very well whenever I jump from place to place.   Is settling down an option?

Also Sean and Nick are both living in Santa Cruz and I am very envious.  It looks like Shane and Andrew will both be in Irvine and I am seriously jealous.  I have always relied on Andrew to provide the friend group where I wasn't a dominant personality (read Extrovert).  Now that he is forming his own, second friendships (and integrating them with his current and past as he always does) I would like to be there for it.  Furthermore, How tight would it be to go to college with my brother albeit Grad and Undergrad...That would be more fun than a keg of drunk monkeys.

Instead I am moving to Idaho.  

Austin will be hard to leave and I don't think my time is up here yet.  I don't foresee myself dating anyone while I am here, which may be compelling enough a reason to leave.  If I can find no suitable method of occasionally satisfying my carnal desires, then I'll be pretty sick of this place after about three years I think.  Also it might be culture shock moving back to a place not Texas.  I have carved out a home here and I am loathe to leave.  

All of this because of Chaos.  I am working diligently and strongly for my professors.  They give me unreasonable demands that I was once able to fulfill, but now that I am having all these weird stomach aches and vegan-ish, I am having trouble accomplishing with, if you pardon the pun, any regularity.  I feel if I am going to work my tuchas off and not really make a livable wage, then I should at least be doing something I love.  Something I can get excited about.  Something I can jump up on a table and shout about how cool it is.  It is weird, but I finally found something that is intuitive and challenging and fun to me; and yet I am not doing it.  Step by Step, I will get there.   My five year plan has changed every year for the past three or four years.  Sometimes it has vacillated more than once a solar cycle.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So as some of you may or may not know I had my first colonoscopy EVER yesterday.  And let me just say it was a load of fun.  I actually did feel much better after the procedure oddly enough.  In any event, here were some of the choice words that I said under sedation via Anthony's retelling.  

--Me: "Hey, did you guys video tape the procedure?"
Nurse: "No."
Me: "That is a shame.  I could have put it on YouTube or something."  

--"Today is gonna be awesome.  I should have one of these every morning; I don't have to do any work today."

--Apparently I needed to drink something afterwards I so they gave me a juice selection and I choose apple.  They brought it to me in a can which I stared at for a while before before drinking.  After consuming it and setting it down I said something like, "Why did I get apple juice, I HATE apple juice.

--I told the nurse all about how I wanted to be a computational physicist. 

--When Anthony first walked in he asked me how I was.  I said, "Oh man I am so relaxed.  I feel like I could go into my parents basement and smoke weed and listen to Pink Floyd."  

If I find out about any others I'll let you know but I think that was all of the good ones.  All in all, yesterday was by far the most pleasant day I have had since coming to Austin.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Python 3000</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have been reading about Python 3000, the forthcoming next stage of my favorite programming language.  Initially I was appalled, frightened.  They are doing a couple of things that are scary but take a lot of courage.  First, they are breaking backwards compatibility.  Furthermore, knowing how I code, nothing I have written so far is inane enough to make it past this barrier.  This partially because they are making print into a function rather than a syntactical element like for, if, etc.  This really annoyed me until (who wants to type parentheses anyways?) they pointed out that as a function it could be overwritten in your module!   How fun would that be to have a version of print that highlights every letter 'e' in red when it prints.  Furthermore, I think this helps with some of the otherwise weird issues in running external programs inside of python with respect to printing stout.

However, one of the main philosophies about Python is that everything (that can be) is a list.  This makes refereeing to elements inside of otherwise bulky structures ease, and iterating over them simple (imported files for example are lists of lines read from that file, or can be).  This adherence is going away and being replaced for some structures (like dictionarys) with iterators.   The dict.keys() object won't be a list...which is odd, but instead will be an iterator over the list of the dictionary's keys.  Similarly, range() will be an iterator that is know known as xrange().  Iterators tend to be more effiecent than lists, especially for large lists.  This is good as it will force me, and others, to write better code.  I like the idea of going to iterators where you can.  I hope they make this a full Philisophical change though, rather than simple a couple, often used special cases. 

Python is amazing because of its solidness of philosophy and adherence not "natural coding".  The obvious fear is that if the excitement to come up with something better they may make the product more unusable.  All-in-all I am still excited to see how it all works.  It should be fun to dick around with at the least.  It just seems that all of my favorite CS projects out there are changing or dying.  First my window manager has ended support and the project is dead.  Python is changing.  Gentoo had some internal shake up earlier this year.  If all I have to look forward to is Ubuntu on a Dell, then I will be one Peeved Panda v16.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My Finals are over and my bowels are empty.

If there is one thing that is super disgusting it is a distended belly.  Having lived with this for the past three years, I know what it is like.  The method my doctor prescribed works.  In the process I tried a bunch of different eating habits and have run across one I like.  I am going to need to become more active.  In truth I let this slide as I had no energy and was bunglingly fat  even though very little of it was truly blubber but rather prior meals.  I know this is all terribly interesting but I think it marks an important point.  I still don't feel perfect about the way I look but I do feel a lot better. 

People have to love you for who you are, but part of who you are is what you look like.  Not wanting to be who I was, I think this is a positive change.  

The beard/chin dilemma remains.  For those of you who don't know, I don't have a chin.  One has started to slightly appear having lost some weight.  However I do have a beard, with which I cover it up and fake a chin like nature.  

Also for those of you who do not know, I think beards are the social and biological equivalent of boobs.  Allow me to explain.  Men, naturally, do not get to choose how much facial hair they grow, like breast size for women.  Furthermore, certain sizes and shapes are more socially acceptable than others (or desired).  Because of this a lot of money, effort, and time is spent augment ones natural appearance, beyond what is needed.  The difference in maintenance here is that women have a large one time cost for permanent augmentation where men have a a contiguous upkeep cost.  Women, if you don't believe me, then fine, but this actually happens; men get discriminated against based solely on the quality and style of their facial hair.  Beards, like boobs, when longer, bigger, more natural, and uncovered ones tend to appear on hippies and bikers.  I happened to be born with a large bushy, Muir-like, Rebbe-esque beard which is socially undesirable.  

I am thinking about keeping it shaved again, just as a social test, again. I don't recognize myself without it.  Though I can't stand to watch the show, the best comparison I have to how I keep it now and what I would go to is Rikker from Star Trek: TNG.  

Any thoughts?  I know some of you haven't seen me in a while.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw a really cool pink film called Daydream.  It is a Japanese flick from 1964.  

It was one of those films I only I like and everyone else hates; and I *loved* it.  

It had much in common with Tetsuo: the Iron Man in terms of themes of human degradation my technology/machines and how this leads to degradation by/to other humans.  

Robin may like this film.  Most others (the ones who "get" it) likely wouldn't dig it.

Beyond any plot or morals, It was beautifully shot and magnificently executed.  Also, the main villain was a vampire and totally bad ass in certain parts of the film.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been thinking lately about wanting to see some movies again but haven't really gotten up the nerve.  

Today that was shattered.  I saw both Shrek 3 and Stranger's with Candy.  As you may have guessed, Shrek 3 was good and had some shots that were straight out of Buster Keaton (Steamboat Bill Jr. if I am not mistaken).  

Stranger's with Candy is a must see.  Much of this film, apart from being downright hilarious, had an amazing attention to detail and subtlety.  Stephen Colbert plays a near psychotic in-the-closet gay science teacher part of the joke being that his out self is  a born again Christian.  The periodic table shaped like a cross on the back wall is spectacular and I covet it.  Amy Sedaris had a wonderful role as a quirky and insane woman in her 50s who returns to high school.  While it is an All Star cast in every sense of the word.  Many of the important role are filled by people who are excellent actors with at least regards to what roles they are playing.  Maria Thayer plays an uncomfortable foil to Amy Sedaris' big-house lesbian domineering.  Carlos Alban plays an awesome geeky Indonesian student whose accomplishments go largely unrecognized even by his peers.  

All in all the movie had a sound moral which was delivered in a humorous but unpleasant fashion.  For a film that relies mostly on words to convey its message, this one is certainly high up there on my list.  

I am furthermore pleased that, like riding a bicycle or throwing a Frisbee, watching a film, truly watching a film hasn't quite left me yet and it is not a wholly uncomfortable experience and I still find it pleasant.  This pleases me.  Mostly.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I went and saw the Red Elvises again tonight.  Awesome as always.  Their Synth player rocks hardcore as well.

The collection of women there would have delighted a Turk.  There was a woman there who had a face quite similar to Jessie's.  Even weirder was that she wore her hair in a style that Jessie also had.  I guess it goes with the face.  

There was short girl who was cute in that average-but-short-so-still-cute-and-probably-hates-being-short-because-of-it-kinda way.  There also was a girl there who kinda looked like Maria Thayer from Stangers with Candy.  

And lest you think I was think I was *only* noticing women, there was a guy who looked a lot like Jon.  Also the bartender sort of looked like Andrew 2.  The cut of his jib was very prohibition era and consequently he could call the woman with Jessie's face "sweetheart" and other such affectionate and distancing addresses.  I approved as I typically do.

I think I am more introverted than peeps give me credit for.

Suffice it to say that I have now achieved one of my life-long goals of staying in Howard Johnson's.  This is an obscure hotel chain that is briefly mentioned in an even more obscure Zappa song.  Furthermore the song is *not* on 200 Motels, which is the album where you'd figure a chain such as this would be.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I owe this journal a story partially for me and partially to disseminate this information. 

Alright.  On the drive out to Idaho, about 50 miles north of Las Cruces, NM my car lost all of its coolant. I was driving along and within one minute I got a check coolant light and then all of the water was evaporating out f the top of my hood and I lost all power (while going uphill).  

Unfazed I got out and plugged the fuel injector wire back in (3 out of four had popped out) and poured all of my emergency drinking water that I carried in my "everything" box into the radiator.  This was a calculated risk as I had great cell reception and figured if I could get the car moving I would be able to make it to the next town and buy more water. 

So I was stranded in the desert in some beautiful country.  I would have taken a hike while the car cooled down but I needed to watch the vehicle.  Instead I read some of my book and watched some AMVs on my zune.  Unfortunately the car was deader than a doornail and I got a tow after about an hour and a half back to Las Cruces.  There I had the garage do an $85 inspection. 

It turns out that in no known order the coolant pump and the head gasket died.  There may have been damage to the actual head which would have cost me more.  The known price to fix would have been almost $800.  Keep in mind I have about $300 to my name at this point and I had just taken the car in two weeks prior to get it inspected to make sure it was journey worthy, at least to Idaho.  I dropped about $1000 in it this semester that I don't have.

Also I needed to get to Idaho by monday to go to training which only happens once every week.  

All of the car rental places in Las Cruces were closed by noon or 2 on Saturday and didn't reopen until monday and I was sitting at the garage at four.  

So here is what I did!  It turns out there is a shuttle to the El Paso Airport that runs 12 times a day and I took the second to last one.  There I rented a car that I could only afford with my USAA discount.  Also, I asked on the phone when I was reserving it if I could pay with cash even thought I could give them a credit card.  They said yes.  However, I get there and apparently you need the amount of the rental available on your card when you do this.  I barely had enough to buy gas all the way there. So I called up my credit card and begged them to raise my credit limit.  Jason at the USAA Credit phone service is my hero.  I love his soft collected voice as I struggled with the inaneness that is AVIS policy.

I finally got back on the road, 100 miles behind, 11 hours after I left that morning.  I V-lined for Albuquerque.  There I stayed at a Howard Jonson express.  Sunday Morning I went to the closest Trader Joe's to Austin and it was divine.  I have never been happier to be in Albuquerque.  I then finished the remaining 14 hours of my trip and arrived in Idaho Falls at about 11:30 Sunday night.  I unpacked and went to bed for my five hours of sleep and woke up went to my training.  Success!

Up until this point I was calm and happy.  Patience and some forethought allowed me to effectively see through this challenge.  Besides, I got to spend some extra time in New Mexico, how could one even think of being mad?

Idaho Falls however is a crying shame.  You'd think there would be some mountains here, but there aren't really.  They are small and in the distance.  You'd also think that there would be some waterfalls.  There are but they are artificially created by a hydroelectric dam and only drop like 6 feet.  This town is the definition of Lame!  

Also all the cool stuff in Idaho is far away and needs a car to get to, but since I left mine in Las Cruces.....  Also most of the worthwhile stuff in the city is out of walking range. I am lucky enough to live within a mile and a half of work.  Also my place doesn't have internet so I have to sit in the library with my laptop.  Also the library won't give me a card since I am not a permanent resident. 

I am so out of here in six weeks.  I don't know how I'll leave since I only have $200 mostly to eat with for the rest of the month.  But I will find a way.....

....must get student loan...must buy car.....]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Neon Genisis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok So, I just got through watching Evangelion in a blitz 2-day run movies included.  I hadn't seen it since I was 14 or so.  For those of you who 
haven't seen it, there are really three main age categories of the characters.

1) 14 yro
2) 30-ish yro
3) Those older than 30-ish

I have changed much since I last saw it and have learned a lot about animation and film and psychology since.  I found myself stuggling with it much more now than I had before.  Early on I saw it mostly as an interesting story about people who are generally rather whiny and not really sure of themselves.  I didn't personally identify with any of the characters.  In fact, I still don't.  However my opinions about them have changed.  Or rather, the fact that they are inept and complain a lot doesn't bother me so much anymore.  

Also I lied, their is one character I identify with and that is Ikari Yui, the wife of Gendo and mother to Shinji.  It is eventually revealed that her whole role (which may seem minor, but is the driving force for all events prior to the first episode) is simply so that she can create a symbol or record of humanities existence that will outstrip the even the life of the sun.  This is the ultimate dream of science combined with the baseness of being human.  To create something that will outlast all else that we know proves our power, our intellect.  As a scientist I can respect Yui for both her work and giving into this desire and admitting it openly.  And after all, you're a scientist for god's sake.  

As a story it had a moral and a point, like most stories.  Furthermore that point was something that I have thought about occasionally within the years intervening my viewing and frequently within the past year.  Though the telling is convoluted, Rei eventually reveals the ultimate decision that is placed in Shinji's hands and also the choice he has made.  My way of putting this decision is as follows.  

"If one had the capacity to instantly and permanently (no chance of recovery) and without suffering erase all life, would you?"  

I think the way that people answer that question tells a lot about themselves.  It is an uncomfortable question for most people and the only two people I have formally posed it two tried to shift the terms around and declare that it was irrelevant.  Eva is interesting in that they actually ask this question but do it in such a roundabout way that people don't know that they are asking it until it is too late (end of last movie).  What is even more interesting is that the character that is given that ability comes (or was predisposed) to the same answer that I have.  This answer is that maybe such a state of affairs isn't entirely a bad thing.

From here the moral goes a little soft and for some reason the characters life force is still around and is given a chance to reinstate life should he choose to do so, and of course he does...noting of course that everyone he killed has to resurrect themselves.  This is rather lame but the point was made, they just cover it up so people don't leave on such a downer.

Another thing that irked me this time that didn't before was that the animation was so close to being just balls to the wall weird and out there and convoluted in terms of the story telling.  What bothers me in all of that is of course that it *wasn't* as strange as the makers clearly had the capacity to do.  It felt like they were restraining themselves.  It was almost like they needed it to be approachable to the masses rather than strange and invigorating.  This consistently annoyed me.  Whenever they went into some psychedelic state there was always a voice over walking the viewer through.  I am smart enough to infer what is going on; let me, please.

Most of the pleasure I got out of this watching was from the neat things I would notice that the animators did that are subtle but poetic.  My friend Justin noted when we were kids that there is a rather hilarious moment when the creators are trying to be funny in the first episode when the car is blown over by an N2 bomb explosion.  He noted that this is the one and only point where the animator specifically added in things like that.  However, there are in fact many more, right up to the end, they are simply less blatant.  They relive the tension of the show with out the viewer even realizing it. 

One of the real strokes of beauty however comes at the very beginning of the second movie.  Misato has hacked into some NERV mainframe and is trying to discover its ultimate purpose, why she is doing the things she is doing.  The document is flashed on the screen quickly before something else deletes it.  I however, thinking I could divine some juicy fan trivia, went back and paused at the moment the document flashed on screen.  The document happened to be in English.  The document is actually a story that talks all about the creators of the anime and how they thought of this in college and then eventually got signed to big corporations etc.  If it is not immediately apparent, I will explain how awesome and hilarious and cool this is.  Here is a character who is trying to find the truth and reveal the truth.  What is revealed to her is the full, unadulterated truth.  To her point of view it might be considered a meta-truth.  In explains, to us at least, in detail the whole reason why she exists as an animation in the real world.  But it also explain it to her, which in some sense is forbidden knowledge in any "serious" story.  Furthermore since the document is in English and flashed on the screen quickly, most of the original viewers would have not understood and simply believed that the character had found some truth within the story that she was proported to find and not the absolute truth that is given.

I think I liked it this time much more than before.  Most of the characters are whiny bitches, but hey most of the characters are 14. 

I really should stop watching media.  My feelings afterwards are always mixed.  Do I really enjoy consuming it or am I hunting the past?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alright I have finished the backlogs of Questionable Content in my usual blitz style of reading through comics, manga, webcommics, etc.

I know I originally said that I thought it was kinda a one horse town.  Well, I retract that after the Faye-comes-out-about-her-past strip.  It is now at least a three horse town.

Things I have noticed:

1) While I was slowly, due to lack of effort, putting this together I came to the realization that the indie scene is the modern day analogue to the Mods.  Now QC wasn't the only data point in this fit, but I think it certainly brought the error down a lot.  This is almost disconcerting.  Not that I didn't like the Mods; quite the opposite is true.  What is strange is that they are back, and so subtly.  

2) The author is obviously some sort of post-post-modern nerd humor titan.  A single Dune reference would have solidified this placement.  The “Mom Jabbar” pun however has only ever been matched by Hiro Protagonist himself.  (BTW Robin if you have finished Snow Crash we need to have a talk ^_^  It has been at least 4 years since I have had a good talk about that book)

3) All of the female characters have short hair (as well as all of the male characters).  

Speaking of hair, I think I finally understand one aspect of my mother that had previously mystified me.  My mom tends to dye her hair outrageous colors.  She does this mostly for fun but it also as a device to figure out who the people that are worth knowing and putting the ignorant in her place.  

Today I think I experienced one of my first compulsions post-middle school.  I feel like I should shave my beard, cut, spike, and dye my hair electric blue, wear embossed black leather cowboy boots, a leather trench coat, sunglasses, carry around a gunsword, and paint my right pinky fingernail red and walk around Idaho Falls just to see who would talk to me.  Because you know those people have got to be at least a little forward thinking.  Screw everyone else.  Considering I live across the street from a Mormon temple and walk everywhere...

...They probably wouldn't take kindly to me yelling that they are a heretical cult to a sect of my religion that accidentally believes that Jesus was the Messiah and then mated with and slaughtered a bunch of pagans.  See how Idaho brings out the best in me.

But I am justified, and I will tell you why.  Right here.  In the park across the street from the Temple of the North Star or Neon Genesis Evangelical or whatnot, there is a statue of the Ten Commandments.

I am livid at this statue.

I saw it and just stood their screaming what the fuck at it for a while until I was starting to get a couple of looks.

There are more severe consequences aside from the fact that the commandments are in English (which is most certainly not Ha-Shem's language) and that they are so poorly translated that no wonder people are ignorant (the imperative not to murder is given as “thou shall not kill”, and the covet ones are all messed up).  The two single most assaulting things about this statue are:

1) At the top of each of the two tablets is a little monogram of the two tablets. Ok cool whatever..self referential Mitzvoht.  HOWEVER THE WRITING ON THESE MINI-TABLES IS RUNIC.  That is right, there are Celtic runes on the tablets.  Now keep in mind that this appears in two places on this statue, so the designer clearly knew what they were doing.

2) Underneath and in between these two monstrosities of cultural con-fusion was an Ariel, a lion if god.  BUT he was standing and partially wrapped in a United States Flag!  If this wasn't my brother's Hebrew name I am not sure how personally insulted I would be, but I am sure I would be hurt by it...if not physically ill.

The topper of it all was a disclaimer plaque next to the thing that claimed they weren't espousing any particular religious view but merely trying to represent and pay homage to “mankind's first attempt to codify laws” or some such.  

BOOOOOOOOOOOO

That isn't even trying.  Any high schooler can tell you that the first written law record that is presently referred to as such is Hammurabi's Code.  However anyone with half a brain could figure out that Ur or the Egyptians must have had laws before the Israelites or the Babylonians!  

Fuck!  Moses received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai AFTER leaving Egypt...you know the place with the oppressive leaders and slavery and Pharaohs and a strict hierarchy which must have all been supported by *gasp* laws!

Time to get off my soap box and go buy some hair dye.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I *hate* Idaho.  I *hate* Duncans.

WHY do I *Love* Duncan Idaho?

It might be transparent but I have also joined the Dune bandwagon.  My stop is coming up soon though.  I am rereading the fifth book.  The more I think about it they, just get better as the series goes on.  Miles Teg is a complete bad-ass.

And speaking of bad-asses, I saw my first Lupin III.  Specifically, The Castle of Cagliostro.  It was beautiful the older Animation way that I love so much.  But, back to the point, no character n that whole movie was not incredibly cool.  

This, naturally, brings me to my point.  People are drawn to representations of humans who that they can't relate to.  The familiar argument that humanity connects with its art through personal substitution just does not always hold.

Now ok, that may be obvious that it isn't strictly true because very little is strictly true.

The point is that there is so little that unites me to most of these characters, likable or not from the, it is strange that I am drawn to them.

There may be some fundamental human truth this figures typically face great adversity and hold up with astonishing resolve and wit.  Now, all must face adversity and fear and danger.  The characters' cleverness is certainly admirable.

Now, from a moral perspective, almost none of these characters win because they are on the side of Righteousnesses.  

Ok so now we can say that someone is bad-ass and deserving of praise if they are good under pressure if not good people.

This does not eclipse non-bad-asses from being compelling.  

So in answer to the original question I think that Lupin would be able to beat Duncan Idaho in hand to hand combat BUT only if Duncan Idaho did *not* have his mentat abilities and was not in a Tleilaxu enhanced ghola.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To the ancient Greek writer, Herodotus,
Said a pretty young thing, "My how hard it is!"
Said he, "Do you fear
I will hurt you, my dear?"
And she said, "Are you crazy? Thank God it is!"

--Isaac Asimov

Asimov would clearly trump both Lupin III and Duncan Idaho.  

The library here is an interesting place.  The only graffiti I have noticed here is on the inner wall of the male down stairs bathroom stall and it reads simply:  "BOOK".  

Maybe they are still learning.  Other choice bits I have read across town include "I believe in faeries" and "Anarchy is Cool." 

I'll admit. I have been listening to Nightwish on my Zune at work.  It makes me feel cool.  I can't explain it.  I shouldn't even try to.  For some reason, in these moments all thoughts and feelings of camp in the work are expunged and I fall into the simple joy of rockin' out to the best power cords in the UNIVERSE.  See how Idaho brings out the best in me.

My cousin Aaron wrote the Wired Article about the last interview with Mr. Wizard (which h actually conducted).  

--Also Asimov

Said Joe, "When I leave my young Stephanie,
Her cries of unhappiness deafen me.
But I make no apology,
I rely on technology,
And screw her by wireless telephony."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Israeli's are secretly the Bene Gesserit. 

There I said it.  

Let's look at the facts.  This recent Palestinian civil war is an amazing feat of strategy in terms of the Sisterhood's ghols.  Think about it.  The Israeli goal is, more or less, to survive as a state.  Unfortunately, they are a country surrounded by countries that either don't want them in the region (Iraq, Iran, Yemen, UAE, etc.), countries they have conquered and forced peace out of (Lebanon and Egypt), or Jordan who doesn't want to be in the cross fire.  Furthermore, internationally Israel has gotten a lot of flack for some of its practices in varied fields.  yet they are still tolerated everywhere.

The only thing they aren't doing is a forced breeding program.

It is optional.  This Fatwa-Hamas conflict has the Bene Gesserit signature all over it.  Israel is in ultimate control of the situation here.  They could move in at any moment and declare martial law and stop the fighting, but that would be considered rude.  It is possible that everything in the past, their whole degradation of their own reputation would just be to prove that they are fundamental more organized than their opponents.  They have the Other Memories.  If they didn't plan this then they are certainly taking amazing advantage of the situation.  

On another note, I am pretty sure Isaac Asimov founded Ix.  

I once followed the Golden Path
To escape the Tyrant's Wrath.
Then I gave it up later
To become a Guild Navigator
And now all I do is Math!

Mechanic:  What seems to be the trouble?
Me: I think I got some sand in there.  Can ya clean it out?
Mechanic:  Well, let's take a look under the Shai'hulud.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I must drink beer.
Beer is the mind-killer.
Beer is the little buzz that brings total hardcore crunkness.
I will face this beer.
I will permit it to pass into me and through me.
And when it has gone I will turn the barstool to see the rest of the bar.
When the beer is gone there will be none left.
Only one Bourbon and one Scotch.

If you couldn't tell I went drinking last night.  

This is surprising because I was not planning on having a drop at all in this hell-hole of a state.  

I was sort of dragged out to this comedy club thing last night.  I wasn't planning on going at all; instead I was going to organize part of my home file system.  As I was doing this though I came across an old text document that contained part of an old AIM conversation that Sean and I had.  It was like he reached cross the years and put me in my place.  I laughed so hard I was on the floor.  I went to the comedy club.

This guy Jake, who Josh works with and I could easily call friend, was not yet at the venue and was press-ganged into picking me up.  This meant I wasn't driving. 

He picked me up at the Mormon Temple, wind blowing through my hair and telephone receiver.  However, there was a girl in the passenger seat.  Odd, Josh hadn't mentioned anyone else and by Jake's own account from the day before he was single.  

She was introduced as Ariel, Jake's sister.  So I had heard of her, I just wasn't aware of her presence in Idaho.  Jake had mentioned she used to live in the City. Other than that....

We made it over to the club, where precisely Two (2) events of note occurred.  The rest was a typical, well-played social encounter.  You can fill in the gaps.  

1) My eyes turned green.  Real Green.  The kind of color they only change to on special occasions.  Most of the time when I see a fine girl my eyes turn blue out of defeat.  Green.  This is something else.

2) After they comedy was over they brought out a DJ and laid some phat beats.  The group of like 9 of us went to the floor for various time periods.  The odd thing was that this big in all dimensions man thuggishly tapped me on the shoulder after the music had stopped and the floor was clearing.  

“We're leaving.” I said.
“I'm not a bouncer dude...” he responded and I looked at him blankly. 
“... That girl over there wants to talk to you dude.”
“What the fuck are you talking about man.  Go away.”  I left.

The girl was surrounded by a veritable posse of others. I am glad that even in my much inebriated state that I could smell the stink on this.  Strange.

The night was not without mistakes.  Early yesterday I had planned to tell all new people, when they asked me what I do, that I am a writer.  If they probed deeper I would be forced to tell them I am merely an academic. 

I totally forgot to do this with Ariel, but I was with her brother and another coworker so it probably wouldn't have worked.   But if it had it would hve been beautiful since she has a degree in English.  

I have a lot of unanswered question on how to proceed from here.  My intentions are not pure and that is the way I like it.

Even if everything from here on out goes awful, at the very least this is a good case study.

Last night was amazing.  I really enjoyed myself.  I guess some fun quantum tunneled into Idaho.

My son found a nice little vixian
He tells me she's a wealthy Ixian.
But for my Jewish boy
Never a Goy.
And besides she is such a shiksian.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After less than 24 hours, a Google search on "Dune Jokes" had brought up the last post as the third hit!  Crazy, huh?

Unfortunately this will probably go away since I locked this post today.  I had originally intended it to be “friends only readable” since there was some possibly sensitive material in there.  I realized I hadn't after I had left the library.

Yesterday's post was not all inclusive as I wanted to keep it to one topic. I think this town is so suppressed that some very odd things happen here.  It is a matter of observing them as odd.  While strolling down various byways on the way to/from a bookstore, Two (2) things happened:

1) A repeat of the “Cheese grater” incident.  Two youths were riding down the sidewalk towards me. Female on point and male behind.  As the 16 yro boy passed me on my right, he said, with great clarity of purpose in a voice only the three of us were sure to hear,

“GOOOOOOOOONADS”

If only there had been a leather couch or chair or even an ottoman around, I would be rolling on it.

2) A man (if you can call such a degraded beast that) rode past me from behind.  He was dressed as a hot dog and was riding a Vespa.  To top it off he had a sign on is back that I could clearly read as he rode off into the sunset that simply said “DOG”.  You know, just in case.

At the Bookstore I picked up “Chapterhouse: Dune”, which is the last FH Dune book I have to read (I missed it before somehow).  It turns out that I must be somewhat Atredies.  My prediction a couple of posts ago about the Israeli's secretly being Bene Gesserit is completely true.  Just by another name.

It turns out that throughout all of the crap that happens in the Dune universe that Jews have survived and have formed a secret society that they even the Bene Gesserit are not allowed to speak about.  

What is more future Jews have their own Other Memories, have mastered pain, can have sex with Honored Matres and not become slaves (the only others in the Dune universe that can do this are Kwisatz Haderachs in waiting can do), and they have their own separate breeding program.  Of course many of them are also Mentats and Suk doctors.  Moreover, from what I know right now, they can do all of this without Melange!

I love being a Jew!  Even in a fake future.

Things I am currently contemplating:  Ariel, Ana wrote emailed me this week (twice), and Miss “Green Sweatshirt” Allison from Wheatsville just called me and told me she has started reading the book I lent her and that she is no longer working at Wheatsville.

Someday the pieces will fit together.  

How many Bene Gesserit does it take to screw in a light bulb?
One to screw it in and 400,000,000 to have bred the right bulb to be able to screw into many sockets at once.  What's more it is screwed in a generation early!
Caveat:  Thomas Edison was Greek and Fought in the Trojan war.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What is difference between a Cell Phone and a Tampon?
Cell Phones only go into assholes.

I have spent the last Two (2) days walking, wandering, reading aimlessly in a mall.  Odd considering I freak out whenever I go into an HEB or an Albertsons.  

However, I consider this all part of my Mentat training.  I am gathering data points.  I am desperately trying to understand this place.  People I meet 
in any sort of professional of formal environment (eg work or when I am purchasing something like a meal or other commodity) are always wholesome, genuine 
and kind.  The random person on the street, the Stranger, is a complete asshole.

The first is easily imagined.  The Stranger needs some examples.  First, many times since I have been here and twice today, folk have shouted, screamed, 
yelped as they pass me by in their cars.  I am always on foot on a bicycle.  Their purpose is clearly to scare me.  Occasionally they just honk.  
Today, some asshole in a 200X convertible Ford Mustang actually had a megaphone mounted in the car.  In between the unintelligible yips and yelps they were 
essentially just spitting into the receiver.  

This clearly combines whatever idiotic tendencies this person had with a certain amount of Promethean inspirations.  Unlike the famous titan, they were 
using their powers for evil and self amusement.  

Similarly,when I have passed pedestrians on a bike I have gotten more than one slur and expletive to watch out even when I am nowhere near hitting 
them.  For some reason they think it in my best interest to do so.  

My time at the mall has helped me put all of this into some perspective.  The pattern has started to form.  

People here are fundamentally afraid of the Other, the Outsider.  They are scared of different ways of doing things.  The Other has to prove their own 
humanity before being accepted.  

Furthermore the society is stale.  There is vary little here that is not an extension of some national or international corporation.  Almost everything 
is homogenized.  Those things that aren't tend to be old and decrepit.  The failing and nearly vacated small downtown is a perfect instance of this.  

Almost everything that is seen is repeated.  The endless repetitions of the tones of what is accepted has taken a huge toll on the communal psyche.  

The people here are so xenophobic that I am not sure they really know what America means.  To them it is simply a word.  I don't think they have an idea 
of what Democracy is.  At the same time they assimilate what other parts of the country they can, but only through their corporate colored glasses.  
Almost everyone here speaks with an accent that is half central valley Californian and half midwest.  Somewhere on the travel across the country in 
their covered wagons, they grew weary, settled down and declared this place god's country.  They gave up.  

Even worse, the locals are waterfat and they do not even know it.  It is disgusting.  I have never felt so removed from nature as I do here.  They 
claim this a high desert and constantly bicker about water rights between town and country, county to county.  However they use such a precious 
resource with such impunity.  EVERY lawn is watered.  All parks are green.  Many trees are planted.  Specifically the non-native disiduous ones that suck 
up vast water.  

If you don't believe me about waterfattness, they treat all resources the same.  Idaho was the only state whose governor did not attend the Western 
State's Governors Association meeting last week.  This was a significant meeting since it had to deal with a unilateral way for all states in the region 
to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Idaho claimed there were more important things to worry about. 

Texas should really invade and show these people how to run a state.  California could, but I think they are too busy with other things right now.  All 
of the surrounding states are too small on their own.  Texas though I think could be convinced to take over Idaho for strategic resource reasons.  Texas 
afterwards would be unwavering in their control over the occupied peoples.  California would surely mess this part up.  Texans I feel would be more of 
the mind "Well, you *had* your sovereignty, but You messed it all up so now its gone.  Oh Well.  Here is how we do things Now."  Idaho needs some tough 
love.

Idaho also needs some diversity if they are ever to recover from this stagnetion and fear of the Stranger.  They are too homogeneous to truly be 
accepting of those not like them. 

Now, obviously, the state has its fringe populous.  These people have given me accounts of growing up here that fit largely into the formulation above.  
Some of them have moved away, but through various economic pressures have had to move back.  

This land is a den of inequity.  They have sold the soul of the Commoner for a Starbucks and Peir 1.  

Mullets, Bullets, Dope is what I'm yearning for.
Southern Hospitality goes out the door.
Get in my Camereo put the pedal to the floor,
'Cause in My Land we still rob liquor stores.

The Other 'L' is right there!  How did they miss it?! 

In other news I lost a bet yesterday and had to pay up today.  Here was the deal.  Josh, my coworker, has this insane sense of distance.  He claimed it was ten miles to the mall from where I live.  It is less than four.  He also claimed that it was 15 miles from his parents house to mine.  

I called him out!

I said it was 5 or maybe six-ish at the most.  This was at lunch yesterday so we bet on lunch today.  Loser buys sort of thing.  He said that anything above 6 was his. 

Consulting Google maps gave this heart crushing answer:

Distance: 6.1 miles.

I tried the old as-the-bird-flies defense, and then the "this is not the most direct route".  He wasn't taking it.  

So even though I was actually right and he was 2.5x off, I ended up loosing and buying lunch today.  Fine whatever.  But then he goes and buys one of the most expensive things on the menu and orders a couple drinks. He really wasn't a graceful winner.  

Needless to say I am a bit peeved.  But I had the moral victory and I will get back at him somehow....I can't be too mad because he let me borrow his bike though.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Q: Why is having a wife and a mistress better than getting a divorce and then remarrying?
A: Atreides never as satisfying.

I hung out with Jake and Josh last night at Josh's house.  This was after my crushing defeat at the hands of Google Maps.  

We worked out in Josh's father's AMAZING home gym.  We lifted weight ad I was clearly the weakling.  Which makes sense sine I do mostly aerobics and the others were much taller and/or stronger.  I did my personal best and am paying for it today.

Jake turns out to be an interesting person.  He has some very interesting and hard to deny political ideas.  For one thing he is a hardcore Capitalist to the extent only Kerry Prime can match.  Politically he is otherwise rather liberal/libertarian.  He kinda reminds me of Tara in these respects.

Also he is buff. I want his body.  To be in it...not to just do floral arrangements with.

I started using my Mentat training to pump him for information about his family and therefore his sister, Ariel.

Ariel is six years older than him.  He expressed some intriguing ideas about his relationship.  

1) Because of the age difference, he didn't feel like he grew up with her.  Which is odd to me since I feel like I am growing up with Jules and he is nine years my youth.

2) He claims she can be grating on him since she takes a sort of "better-than-you" mentality, with him at the very least.

3) Because of 2 he claims tat they don't hang out much and aren't that friendly.

Clearly they don't have a perfect relationship (but who does).

Status:  I have copy of "Dune" waiting to give to Ariel, on the condition she passes it off to someone else after she is done, should I ever run into her again.

Now for the interesting stuff:

Since Jake and I are new friends with this new information, it might uncomfortable to make a pass at Ariel, especially through him.  Which was the Prime Projection before yesterday.  Now, it would be even stranger.

But what is really intriguing is that in some sense, I want to hand off this book and let her make the decision.  This is TOTALLY Weak!

I don't think I have ever made a solid, boldfaced advancement in my life.  At least not to anyone who I thought was a serious possibility.  I always try to find all relevant facts and then manipulate others into making the call.  

What is even more odd about this situation is that even my minor pursuit could jeopardize seriously the limited friend group I have in Idaho.  

In some sense this makes me want to do it even more.  Or be even more bold.  Just to see how people react.  I would do this thing to add to my knowledge base.  

Isn't it wonderful how selfish I am?

What would happen if I asked Jake to give Ariel the book?  Her phone number?  'Found' her at her work?

I haven't settled on a strategy yet.  I have decided to wait until after the Bar Mitzvah to make my move.  

I think everyone I am related to has been touched by Loki.  We all pull this shit.  Some of do it for the good of humanity while others just for themselves.  I used to be the former, but I am moving slowly toward the latter.  

I apologize is this post was a little too Whiny.  Was it?

Q: Why was the God-Emperor of Dune complacent with the plot to kill him by throwing him off of a bridge?
A: Well, you can Leto horse to water....]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry to Ramone this place, but it really blows here.

I was at the YMCA the other day and while I was leaving this odd fellow shambled into the locker room.  

It turns out he is an Artist and his medium is old telephone wire.  He had a slurred speech pattern with many stop gaps in inappropriate places.   He claims to have done an American flag and a baseball cap that made it into the Smithsonian.  

So there was this older, crazy man talking to me.  He told me all about life and how precious every day was.  I am pretty sure he blessed me with some heathen ritual.  I smiled and nodded.

I then found out he had brain cancer and had just passed the five year mark from when it was removed.  

Soundly put in my place I reevaluated my stance of this place as Hell; maybe it is simply a Purgatory where people wait to die?  It is still Hell.

I also just saw my first two Punks in this place.  They were walking out as I was walking in.  The male looked like my former roommate Josh only taller, stronger, and with an actual Mohawk.  The female had bright orange short hair and was earing some sort of black, badass shirt.  She was wearing an incongruous white skirt and flip-flops though.  

They were the most attractive couple I have seen here.  I had to keep myself from staring as I knew it would be misinterpreted.   

Probably the closest I'll ever come to a live SLC Punk except that is where I lay my head tonight!

Out of Idaho! Woohoo!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The following is the speech I gave at my brother Julian's Bar Mitzvah yesterday (more complaining about Idaho up next!):


Julian Alexander Scopatz, whether you know it or not you are surrounded by Wild Animals!  Your Hebrew name, Ariel, means lion of God (which you occasionally resemble).  As a baby you were known as Taz, for the Tasmanian Devil.  Your first programming language was Python.  Your first Linux distribution was Gentoo, which is a species of penguin.  (Shane stands up and says “I am about to become an Anteater, you know UCI). 

You may be asking “So what do all of these beasts ave to do with me?”  Well, for one, you are all ravenous carnivores.

The question you should be asking rather is “What can I learn from my fast and furry-ous friends?”

From the Tasmanian Devil you can learn that life is often a frantic and chaotic experience. You, Jules, can learn to survive only if you are  are able to match the pace of life.  Adapt quickly and be off to the next new and exciting place.

For the Python we are going to go with the Ancient Greek view.  In Greece there were no poisonous or dangerous snakes. These animals were often kept around the house as loyal pets.  They were also rather clean and thus became associated wit medicine in the ancient world.  Therefore, learn to protect the health and safety of family, friends, and loved ones.

From the Gentoo penguin, the lesson is clear.  The world is a cold and uncaring place.  Sometimes you can make it through the day only by submerging yourself totally in its frigid waters and hunting for sustenance.  Other times, there is safety in numbers and you can push through by relying on the masses.  Even the Stranger does not have a heart of stone and their Kindness is a warm retreat from Icy Arctic Blasts.  Our People, have survived for millennia in Diaspora occasionally relying on on this.

From the Anteater comes the important lesson that you do not always have to be exactly like your brothers.  Shoot off into the world.  Do your own thing.  Grow a 14” long tongue.  Whatever.

And finally, Ariel, the lion disseminates his message.  You are Holy.  Your people are Holy.  What makes you, us, we Holy?  You chose us!  You are Jewish because you chose to be.  Mom being Jewish, the circumcision, learning Hebrew, All of it.  These are no more than rituals to let us know that you should be Jewish.  What makes you Jewish now is that, as a man, you have cast your lot in with the people of your birth.  Your decision; your choice.  This, as you know, is a path that once chosen, cannot be veered from any more easily than a train being derailed.  In Jewish society you now have the “right to vote.”

Along with these rights come certain obligations, as always.  As a lion, these charges are doubly present.  As a man you now take responsibility to selflessly do what is best for your family.  You must be Righteous.  You must be a light unto the world.

You have a responsibility to be noble.  You have a responsibility to be benevolent.  You have a responsibility to protect those whom you can.  However, don't loose yourself in this work.  If you are not for yourself, then who will be for you? And if not now, when?

Jay, we are all proud of you and we all love you.  I love you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My belated Mother's day present, delivered at the Bar Mitzvah:

In India a Swami called Mommy
Looked down from her mountain on me.
------"I am a great Guru,
------And I recognize you!
You are Anthony, not Julian, Shane, or Seany."

Her eyes did not lie
So I responded with a sigh,
------"Yes, I come from a land called Idaho
------Where the wind is the least of things that blow
And to return I'd rather die."

"Be consoled now my son,
Of your death we'll have none.
------For as soon comes the Fall,
------It's to Texas with Ya'll
But while you're here we will have a ton of fun in the sun and I'll shun every pun till your done when I'll buy a gun at which point you'd better start to run. 

So my trip was fantastic, mostly.  Basically sans everything that was travel related and I rocked it.  There is so much to tell I will therefore save some for later.  I'll start with some observations about Idaho.

1) I was waiting at a gas station to catch the shuttle bus from Idaho Falls to Salt Lake City so I could take a plane out of this land.  I had gotten thee about an hour early to be on the safe side (I actually didn't know how long it was going to take to walk there and I was overcompensating for my small penis).  I was sitting on the ground outside reading "Pride and Prejudice." I was on the side of the building that was opposite the sun.  A couple of 60-something men wearing baseball caps and suspenders come round the corner a little after half past and say "Getting some shade, eh?"  I reply "Certainly."  They light up.  A couple minutes later the say, "Hey young fella, do you have the time?"  I stand up and tell them the time and they tell me they were just wondering what time zone they were in.  This piqued my curiosity so I asked them where they were headed and they told me California.  Further inquiry revealed that they were visiting a bother in Montana and were on their way home to Chico.  They told me n amusing story about how just before they left some of the college students piled Six (6) couches together in the middle of the street and burned them in celebration at the end of the school year.  This brought back found memories of Isla Vista.  All in all this was the most pleasant conversation with a stranger I have had here. It just goes to show that the nicest people in Idaho are actually from California.

2)  More Graffiti Phun:  On the road between Idaho Falls and SLC there is an entire three story abandoned building that has every square in covered with graffiti.  The subject matter of all of this is simply homecoming messages to those returning missionaries.  For example "Welcome Elder So-and-So" is all over this derelict.  Those goddamn mormon punks...think they can just go about like they do...

3)  People here call Idaho Falls "IF".  This really confuses me because I can't understand why anyone would ever want a port here.


Haha!

I bought a car!  I drove it out here!  

You can look at it here:  <a href="http://scopatz.googlepages.com/home">http://scopatz.googlepages.com/home</a>

I bought this totally impractical toy for about $3k under the blue book price.  I am way pleased.  It has a couple of odd issues like the gear for the convertible top is stripped so you have to open it manually, but I think I can live.  

The reason I got this baby so cheap was because the owner was moving back to France in 10 days.

Also my financial aid came through so I will no longer be under the threat of starvation!

I think that is enough for now.

I want to be like Pardot Kynes.  Is this such a crime?  I am already focused on high level system studies.  Is planetology so far removed? (Watch me answer my own rhetorical question) No.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What is Helen Keller's Favorite color?
Corduroy.

Alright, I know Helen Keller jokes...

I was going to write about how awful getting to California was, but that seemed LAME so I stopped.

Instead I will tell you all about my movements starting with my New Car!

Basically it is a 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder (he is our hero) Two (2) door Convertible.  I got it with a mere 70,000 miles.  I bought it for $5,000 which is about $2,500-3,000 under blue book.  The main reason it was such a deal was that the gentleman I purchased it from was moving back to France in Ten (10) days.  

It has a four liter engine with a nice sound system. It can cruise at 80 or 90 mph without batting a metaphorical eye.  It can theoretically seat 4 people.  Two of them should be small or sort or non-existent.

I am very glad I poured the money I would have spent fixing my old Mercury Tracer into getting this puppy.  Humorously, the insurance on this $200 cheaper every 6 months than my last car.  I think this is because of the Two (2) airbags.  

I am also happy that I kept it within the less than 10 yro margin.  

Even after driving it all the way out here to Idaho Falls (port to IF?) I am still getting used to driving it.  

1) Unlike my other cars and some of the other ones I was looking at, you can feel every bump, curve, and uneven patch in the road. While this is aMAZing on the one hand, it is very different from the type of vehicle that barrels over everything in sight.  

2) 70 seems dreadfully slow.  I daresay it is difficult to drive in residential areas.

I'll suffice it to say that the after the drive out here I know Nightwish a lot better.

Enough about my car.

I woke up pregnant today.

It was an illusion but a good one at that.

My stomach was distended again to all get out.

I really hate this bullshit (which on another level I purchased the first season of yesterday).

I have called my doctor and talked to a nurse but am awaiting the head dudes response.  The concoction I am currently on clears up to constipation pretty well.  I am still bloated.  Quite so.

It is an interesting thing though.  I have been having these problems for at least two years.  However for the first year I didn't recognize it as a problem.  This is because I was fat.  Thus I thought that I was just having slightly fatter days.  Having lost some weight I am now able to notice when I bulge out 2-5 times my normal size.  Thus by being healthier I found more problems.

This makes me wonder what other ailments I have that I am simply to sick to notice. This is likely true for many problems.

I think cancer is a perfect example of this.  Historically, cancer wasn't a primary disease since people did not live long enough.  However, as the life expectancy grew, so did the cancer rate.  The analogy is perfect for my dummy tummy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nothing is funny today.

If getting here in the middle of the week was bad enough, I am absolutely dreading this weekend.  I don't even have anything specific to hate. 

I have a car now so I guess I could take off and go somewhere but I am surrounded by Idaho!

I don't know why this place depresses me so.  If anyone actually wants to live here I say let them...move them all here.  

I have decided to get out of here at the first opportunity, which means next weekend I am going to force myself to go to the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone.  It would be a crying shame if I came up here and didn't go to the National Parks.  

I don't really want to go either.  I simply couldn't live with myself if I passed this up.

It isn't that I am lonely.  I am horrified by life.

The way people make their comings and goings is atrocious.  I cannot safely say that I want to kill everyone around me, rather I want them dead.  

I *know* I don't get to make this decision; I *know* it would not be Righteous to have them all destroyed.  If I were Lot, Idaho would be rubble and I'd never look back.

I also know I am quite misanthropic today.  A true dystopia would be preferable to this absolute atrocity of a land.

HEAR ME NOW IDAHO, I, a Latter Day Saint of sorts, have come to tell you to get out while you can!  Leave Before this place descends into a pit of its own awfulness.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So a black man walking along the beach found a lamp in the sand. He picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a Jewish genie.  The genie said, "I'll grant you two wishes.  Anything you desire."

The black gentleman thought about this for a while and then said, "First, I wish to be white.  And secondly I wish to be next to some warm, wet pussy."  So the genie turned him into a tampon.
--From the Truly Tasteless Joke Book

I don't know if any one else has ever noticed this, but I have.  In Austin, walking around campus, I ofen see hot, hawt, or good-looking guys going with gals that are not quite as attractive (in my skewed book).  

Oddly, this natural order of things seems to be reversed here in Idaho Falls.  I more often than not have seen the more attractive member of a couple be the female.  

This is all working up to this couple I saw yesterday which was by far the most dichotomous I have had the chance to observe along these lines.  The female looked to be healthy and well proportioned.  Thin, but not unnaturally so.  Tall-ish and well developed.  The male was a 5'9" - 5'10" sasquatch who weighed 200-225 lbs.  None of this mass appeared to be mussle.  If there is such a thing as a beer belly, he was packing a kegger.  The female was absolutely hanging on her partner like a gibbon at an Ape 'abitat.  

If put seperately one would not place these two on the same level, or even prime material plane.  

(Interjection:  I am sitting here at Villa Cafe, my home I'd rather live in, and there is this strange middle aged couple that keeps staring at me.  I stare back and they turn away momentarily.)

In other news, Nightwish is touring again!  

Even better than this they are going to San Antonio in November.  I am going.  Furthermore someone is going with me, beacuse going to concerts alone is lame.  Ya'll can volunteer now or draw straws as the sacrifice or whatever.  There must be one who will partake with me or be unwillingly victimized otherwise.  If persecution is the only option, I will of course pay for the ticket.  I'd rather it not come to that though....

I have been invited to float the Snake River on Tuesday with some coworkers.  I am not sure I am going to go.  I think it is up to how I (read my stomach) feels that day.  I haven't tried my swimsuit on in years.  Ok a little more than a year but still.  

I am slightly less pregnant today.  My doctor took me off of the probiotic (which didn't really work) and has instead put me on an antibiotic.  

The thinking I guess is that there was some good bacteria that wasn't populous enough and that is why I was all bloated.  However since this doesn't appear to be the case, there may in fact be too much of a bad bacteria so now we must kill it.  

Lets hope this works!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why do all (read most) of the chicks that are on Penn and Teller's Bullshit have to be smokin' hot?  
It is such a conundrum to see them in their physical glory while being throughly debunked mentally.  

So I had written this whole huge post this weekend that was amazing.  But I left it o my main machine at home which has no internet.  It is a little philosophically entrenched, so ya'll will have to wait until tomorrow to not read it.  I know I loose peoples attention whenever I go off the deep end like this.  But I think this one is important. Furthermore I expect most everyone to disagree with me, so if you don't you should really speak up so we each know that we aren't the only whack jobs in the world.

I took my car into the shop today to get a tune-up, new back tires, etc. So I am with only my feets to moves mes around again.

I frankly do not know how I got any work done today at all.  I listed to the Penn Jillette radio show the *whole* 9-10 hrs at work today.  The show is now unfortunately off the air but the backlogs of the podcasts are available online.  

There were times when I wanted to just burst out in explosive, infantile laughter but had to hold back since my cube-mate work totally not understand Penn's whole day of people calling in and giving their own obituaries was a work of comedic genius.

On the plus side of this side, I may, *may* get to go to ApocaLARP.  I might even get to NPC with my cousin and his new female attachment.  

Also if we thought we had it bad in Austin with the Anthonies floating around everywhere, we were dead wrong.  My cousin informs me that my friend Rachel (with whom I have a near avuncular relationship) has dragged Andrew 4 into their friend group.  At dinner at Anime Expo (which was this pas weekend) they had Four (4) Andrews in a party of Eleven (11).

It's all about the way that it unfurls

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A friend who shall remain nameless was speaking to me about Name Magic.  By this, of course, was the process by which naming something gave this person power over said things.  In this case, if I remember and understood clearly, the objects being named were emotions.

This person claims that the naming of certain emotions grated the ability to not Hate.  The observational morsel that this all leads up to is that this ability was viewed as a positive quality by the unsaid person.  

Note: The personage and the situation in which this all arose are not of importance to about half of the readership here and the other half might simply find it quaint should they care.  Therefore the basis for the problem which I now present has been given in the most fundamental terms.

Quandary: Is there a justification for Hate?  Is Hate one of those emotions that exists only to be conquered?  Is the mastery of Hate one of those properties by which ones own humanity may be measured? 

Caveat: I am not sure any of the questions proposed above are indeed the question.  They may in fact merely beat around some central question.  Therefore the point of this may be to find what the central question is.

So I will start out by admitting my humanity.  I hate people.  Certain people.  These are people I have met and those I have never known.  I shan't name them; that would be rude.  

I have always been taught not to hate.  I have been taught that hate is a strong word, maybe the strongest.  I have been taught not to use it lightly.  

However, one of the most beautiful things about this country (which I Love by the way) is the implicit right to Hate.  In the United States you can hate anyone or anything.  This is guaranteed by the philosophy that thought crimes should be illegal.  Even, treasonous thought crimes should be illegal.  (though this is a bit off topic, treasonous though crimes should be illegal because the only method to defeat them is through allowing them.  If you allow people to hate the country you show them that the government is better than they could have imagined because of this benevolence.  Oppressing hateful beliefs towards the state only inflames them.  Better to let the kindling burn itself out.)

No one can tell me, as a citizen, how to feel.  Now, expressing some of these beliefs publically (especially if untrue) may be defamatory, and that would be illegal.  But I can Hate!

Like with any right afforded me, I will not throw it out nor piss on it.  I treat this assumed right the same way I do voting.  I am therefore very selective in my hate.  My hate is hard to earn.

Philosophically, I am allied with Dante quite closely on some issues.  Specifically I believe that betrayal is the absolute worst act one may commit against a fellow human.  As I think about it this is because active betrayal is the first step to a series of other crimes. Being Jewish, there is a mostly historical political movement you can guess I Hate.  My great grandfather fought valiantly in the Great War for the Germans for God's sake.  

The people in my time whom I Hate are not in a position where Name Magic is going to subdue my hate.  I have named the causes.  I have named the effects.  I have this power over the situation.  I consciously choose my Hate over all other options. I daresay even that Hate was the best solution to a most bothersome problem.  

So mayhaps the situations for me and my friend are different.  I have clearly chosen Hate while this person is trying to avoid it.  Now here is what I do not understand: the avoidance of Hate.  I feel that morally, in their shoes, Hate could be justified (from what I know).  This person my be avoiding Hate thus because it is more comfortable to not hate.  This isn't a bad reason.  If the situation doesn't require it, then humans should be allowed to pick the manner in which they live their own life.  

Also it might be seen that Hate could hinder this situation.  Information is always more important to have than ease of emotion.  If Hate would inhibit the gathering of data then it could be deemed prudent to not do so.  

Now that I have babbled on for a while, it is important to restate the question.  Hate was being avoided to gather more information which manifested as Name Magic.  This Name Magic gave power over Hate.  However, once the Name Magic is obtained what reason is there to still pursue the avoidance of Hate?

I would claim that there is no compelling reason to avoid Hate once one has power over it.  One could keep avoiding it simply to prove that the power over it is real and absolute.  

I think that there is also a severe difference of perspective.  I am using Hate, and most other emotions, as a tool.  My friend is viewing Hate as an adversary in and of its own right. Maybe it is this perspective difference that bothers me.  

It isn't that the viewpoint is alien; it is all too familiar.  I held the same opinion for many years and thought myself a good person.  Now that my stance differs, does this make me a bad person?

I think where we meet is here.  We both desire power over Hate, but view it as two different heads of the same beast.  My friends power comes through Name Magic and degrading Hate to other, possibly less sever emotions.  This means that Hate isn't even itself.  It is something else that isn't worrying as much about.  My power comes through its manipulation.  

But I have always been sneaky.  

You may then wonder why I have told you all of this.  Doesn't this blow my sneaky cover?  This is because when I decide to Hate you, you will have forgotten all of this.  And after I remind you that you have been warned you will Hate me all the more.  Sneaky, see?

I can play on a fair and open field, and win!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?
--Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone, Pearl Harbor Song, Team America: World Police

The quote above, as funny as it is, is Completely true!

I saw "Transformers" last night.

Allow me to preface this.  Yesterday started off wonderful and ended Awful.  Job was being channeled pretty  hard.  It started off by me going rafting on the snake which was a lot of fun.  It ended with me realizing that the garage I left my car at had scratched my car on the passengers side and I drove off with out realizing it and with my apartment flooding in about an inch of water.  

So I went to see "Transformers".  I wanted to watch some pretend violence to relieve some of this frustration and I had already seen "Live Free or Die Hard".  

Ok, "Transformers" was terrible.  There I said it.  Now this doesn't mean you shouldn't go see it.  

Still, if they did everything else in the movie wrong what was done correctly with an amazing clarity of purpose was movement.  The filmmakers captured the fluidity of movement of the autobots superbly.  In some 
sense, this is the entire point of the Transformers story.  The whole point is that there are these huge mechanical constructs  but these ease with which the artefacts are able to alter their very shape is astonishing.  It is even more impressive and shocking since they take the form of objects that are, if not stationary, quite rigid typically.  

So they captured the basic element.  However, all other elements of the movie were bad to physically painful.  For example, the script.  If the script were dropped on the Iran they'd stop their enrichment program from brain damage.  Unfortunately, when airlifted into Idaho, the populous beacame smarter.  

Like most stories, the main characters were not the most badass.  This blows goats since they are the damn Transformers and should be sweet as hell and make you sticky as honey.  Optimus Prime wasn't even kinda cool.  

The support characters were all much much better.  Bubble Bee rocked the house, The main female lead was as amazing as all get out.  The US Air Force squad were the most badass humans in the movie as they took down Two (2) Decepticons without any help.

This actually brings me to an interesting point.  Almost all stories have the coolest characters take a 
backseat or adversarial role. This is because there is a perceived method by which the coolest people somehow take away from having a main character who has some hardship to overcome.  

Some Examples:  YT and Raven are waaaay cooler than Hiro in "Snowcrash".  Escaflone just kills off Balgus immediately (which is reason enough to stop watching).  Any Final Fantasy game.  Anything in a horror genre has to satisfy this sans maybe Army of Darkness.  Star Wars: Luke is one pansy ass mofo.

There are some exceptions to this rule and these exceptions are dear to my heart.

The ancient world certainly function in this self-deprecating way.  All of the Heros like Beowulf, Gilgamesh and Heracles are far and wide the most badass, most hardcore people around.  Foxy Brown from the blaxplotation film by the same name starring Pam Geiger.  And of course Dune.

In Dune, Paul is the most powerful and smartest character in the entire universe.  To that end he literally starts off basically with his mom in the desert and then becomes a Benevolent Dictator for Life.  No one in the Dune universe can beat Paul.  

So you were right, this was an elaborate excuse to talk about how awesome Dune is. However I did get to point out that Micheal Bay really made something that could have been good and campy and turned it into something that was bad and crappy in part because of the fact that not even Optimus Prime was noticeably heroic.  He seemed more like a soldier following orders.  I pray they don't make a sequel.

I was always more of a He-man kid myself.

Happy 4th of July!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What is wrong with this country is that when given the choice more people in this country would rather talk about the draft than breasts.
--Penn Jillette

So I went and walked around the river where the fireworks were held last night for the 4th of July.  Initially I went just to do some data collection about the populous of this "great" state.  I figured it would be a good opportunity to see a good cross-section of society here.  

Everyone is American; everyone like watching shit git blown up.  (On a side note I was likely the only person in the country and therefore the world listening to Nightwish while watching fireworks last night and it was a blast!)

The data collection was useful. but nothing that you couldn't really guess with the exception that I saw about 6% Asian females.  I saw no Asian descendant males.  The fun part is what I started doing next.

I decided to start staring directly into peoples eyes as I walked by.  If they held my gaze I would try to stare them down as long as they were within sight.  Here is what I learned:

Most people didn't even notice that you were looking at them.  Most people who noticed would quickly look away or flicker their eyes in a different direction.  

Of those few who would hold your gaze most were female.  Of the men that would hold, almost all would not go out of their way.  They would stare at me back only as long as it was convenient.  Some of the women however, would move their head and follow me to keep looking.  These women went out of their way to lock eyes.  Sometimes they (the women) would be seamlessly be carrying on a conversation while doing this.  I was impressed.

Not to degrade men too wholly in this exercise, there was one guy who was amazing. He was standing in one place but was doing the same thing I was!  When our eyes met we both held steady until I was almost past at which point we both realized what the other was doing.  He smiled and gave the canonical "sup" head nod.  I smirked and responded with a head jerk of my own.  That man is deserving of praise.

The funny thing about this that I noticed is that man who had were either hanging on fly babes or had their ilk clinging to them were more likely to return the stare.  However, they would also very nervously look away almost immediately. I can't deny that this wasn't pleasurable.  

Lest you think I was only picking on those weaker than me I tried to stare down people larger and stronger than me.  I even starred down a cop.  He was pussyfooting around the business I was bringing to his table.  I am certain that in a different situation this defender of law's personality would have shown through a bit more.  

If this were any measurement of humanity, most people would have failed.

Of course this wasn't a fair test since they did not know they were being tested.  

Find a big crowd sometime and try this.  It is fun.

I am sure there are many theories for this behavior, but I won't go into them.  My purpose is to gain an intuition about people's behavior in order to psuedo-predict it in the future.

Another data point, another link in the thought process.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[More Graphphitti Phun:
In response to other tagging:  If you always spell always "allways" you will always be a retard.

So I went camping this weekend in the Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.  I'd never been.

All in all it was a god experience though I had some problems initially.  I stayed both nights in Grand Tetons.  To list the problems

1)  Ok so Tetons was ridiculously commercial for a National Park.   There were at least three full blown resorts that you could stay at inside of the park boundaries that were privately owned and operated.  Needless to say this increased the price f my campsite to $17 a night.  Apparently this is because there are weird laws that grandfather out the land use rights of the park.  

2) As a consequence of 1 motor boats were allowed on the lakes, to the point of even allowing jet skis.  

3) Because of 1 and 2, Yellowstone, even with its increased popularity, was almost more pleasant.

4) I went up a hike in the Tetons that left from my campground and went to the top of Signal Mountain.  It was a good 3 miler each way.   Nice Day hike.  But I get to the top and see all these people and a paved walkway.  It turns out you could have driven to the top.  Rather than being alone, I was surrounded by people who refused to walk even all of the way down the path to get the best view.

5)  The places looked so canonical that they were almost uninteresting because of it.  I know this is a strange complaint/observation.  Tetons looked *exactly* like you would expect so much so that it could be said to have lacked an alluring character.  You have already been there in every book or picture of a mountainous wooded lake.  Now to be fair this was only in the part of the park that I was able to explore in my limited time there.  If I had been able to go backpacking....

6) One of the supporting points that really freaked me out was that none of the trees really breached the 30-40 foot mark on average.  Now being from CA where the trees are 8-10x this size in the regions I tromp around, a 30 ft tree is more like a nice friend than a monstrous reminder of your humanity.

7) Also my minds eye of a forest contains many gigantic boulders everywhere.  Their absence left me altered.

8) The first night I got there was the first night it had rained in a month.  And here I was thinking that I wouldn't have to put on my fly and could look at the stars all night.

I think that is all of my complaints.  They really are beautiful places.  They are worth exploring.  However, I was fully aware of the time I would have and this was clearly not sufficient. If I had 8 weeks or so, I might feel I had accomplished what I wanted in the parks. 

Also I basically went because I knew that if I didn't take this opportunity I would never forgive myself.   

In Yellowstone I went to see a couple of geysers and the canyon.  Old Faithful was, of course, on the list.  More interestingly I saw on the map a place I had to go to. It drew me in.  There is Lone Star Geyser in Yellowstone.  It is a 2.4 mile hike out to it which meant that there were relatively few people on the trail.  Unfortunately here were relatively more people on the trail since it was paved.

I, however, was happy for its asphalted quality and I'll tell you why.  I played fast and loose with this trip and for my day excursion up to Yellowstone I forgot my hiking boots back at base camp and had only my sandals.  However, I wasn't about to go to Yellowstone and not doing any hiking so I toughened it up and decided to go as I was.  Stupid, yes. But lucky too since amazingly the trail I picked was paved.

Will I ever go back?  Probably.  These aren't my first choice for parks to visit but I think it is good every once in awhile to be put out of your natural element.  

Finally, It was kind of sad to have gone camping alone.  I haven't been by myself sine I lived in Los Alamos.  I enjoyed it, but it was clear I am solo-camper out of practice.  Thankfully I reverted quickly back into all of the lone hiker crazy practices like talking to one's self.

Leaving Idaho soon,
Leaving Duncan soon.

A pretty gohla is like a pretty gohla.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Zen Joke:
What did Harry Potter spend all of his boxing money on?
Ballet.

This has been on my mind for about a week now because once I realized it I was really delighted and also sickened and then enamored with the genius of Frank Herbert.

And now that I have dropped the FH name I know I ave lost at least half of you.

Ok here is the deal.  We all know (all of us still reading that is) that Lady Jessica is the not-so-love child of Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.  

Now a lot is in a name in Dune.  Frank Herbert admitted that he chose the name Gesserit because it sounds like Jesuit.  Furthermore, there are other examples like the fremen Jamis, which sounds oddly like Janus.  Furthermore Jamis can be said to be two-faced since he is wrong about Paul and Jessica in life but his death justifies their further living.  Hell, even fremen is a thinly disguised "free men".  

Ok back to our Reverend Mother.  I believe that she, too, is an Atreides.   

Here is my proof.  

To start with recall your Ancient Greek and remember that Atreides literally means "Son of Atreus".  As such, Atreides is a commonly used epithet in the Iliad and the Odyssey describing Atreus' sons.  Namely the heros Agamemnon and Menelaus.  

Now, whether you know it or not the Atreides of Dune claim to be direct male descendents of Atreus.  Clearly then they are either from Menelaus or Agamemnon.  

Suffice it to say Agamemnon was kind of a shitty father.

Menelaus however was the right and proper husband of....Helen!

That is right, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam shares not just a family name of the Atreides but arguably one of the most important Atreides names.  Furthermore, it is well established the Atreides hand down names from generation to generation (eg Leto).

Even more so, Gaius is a Roman name.  Frank Herbert is playing a game in that the Greeks and Greek thought essentially became the Romans.

As for her last name, Mohiam's mother was probably Atreides herself and Bene Gesserit to boot.  Her mother however was ordered to mate with a male from some other blood line.  Mohaim is not known to have ever married.

So what is weird about this?

Well this implies that the Bene Gesserit interbreeding between Atreides and Harkonnen was going on much more than the one generation.  They wanted Paul who was both A and H to be female to wed with Feyd-Rautha.  However, if Gaius Helen Mohiam was also Atreides, then Lady Jessica was also both A and H and she married Duke Leto and bore Paul!  This is two generations of first cousins marrying that we know of!

In summary, Frank Herbert is a sick but amazing bastard that rox my sox.

I am sure you are all glad to know that I finished rereading Dune, so *maybe* I will stop talking about this.

Through not getting the Zen Joke, you get it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Why are cryptographers annoying to go on car trips with?
They have a map, but they'll never stop and ask for directions.

Plans for the Bay Area are forming.  

It looks like I will be able to go to the San Fransisco Silent Film Festival again this year!  How cool is that?!  I am thinking about going to the last show on Sunday night called "Godless Girl" which is about a Atheist girl in high school who gets into fights with one of her Jesus-freak classmates.  And get this, they both get sent to reform school as punishment.

If anyone wants to go with me I would be way happy.

Also on Saturday, it looks like I am going to stop in Reno to have lunch with meine Muti, who will amazingly be on vacation there.  

Unfortunately my life is about to see the loss of a very important Buddha Bed.  This is my foam fold out mattress.  I am going to have to throw it away since it is all fucking moldy from this shitty apartment.  Oh well, it saves me from the $50 shipping cost.

Alright my peeps, I will try to survive my remaining days here.  Wish me luck!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry to disappoint, but this is not an "Almost Out" of that most famous closet that everyone seems to be in.

Rather this is an "Almost Out" of Idaho commentary.

Now before I go, I will take pictures of that stupid statue of the Ten Commandments that is steaming pile of sacrilege.  Unfortunately I do not have the cable for the digital camera here so it must wait until I get back to California.  

My itinerary is roughly that I will be going to SLC by tomorrow night.  On Saturday I will meet up with my mother in Reno for lunch.  Saturday night I am gonna go into he city to go to a show with Tommy and then crash at his place.  Sunday night I will be seeing one of the silent film festival shows, and then need to find a place to stay.  Also someone please go to the movie with me!

So in summary, I hate this place and I am leaving.

Also this marks my last day at this nice coffee house.  Makes me kinda sad in some sense.  With any luck I won't ever be back though.  Some of the only reasonable people I have met in this state frequent or work here.

I am turning into the people I hate, me amigos.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alright, I made it to the Bay Area. 

There are so many things I have forgotten.  But like muscle memory, I have snapped back into place. However, I have a new perspective on this place.  It is like I am foreigner.  Not a tourist, just a foreigner.  

I used to say that if I was forced to live in a city, the city of my choosing would be San Fransisco.  Coming back I realize that, sans weather, Austin is perfect.  

OK ENOUGH!  Time to stop blathering and get down to the story.

Now this story is the greatest story ever told, to me, yesterday.

I got to Berkeley last night at about 6 pm.  Tommy and I went to the city to try to get into a club to see a band but the venue was small and wouldn't have made it in.  We eat dinner and come back to Berkeley and go to this bar called "Raleigh" I think and get drunk, as it seems I always do when I go to Berkeley.  

At the bar Tommy met up with one of his coworkers named Brendan.  So this guy is a friend of a friend kinda deal.  Now his friend, Evan, was also there.  And Even walks around with the greatest story I have ever heard, yesterday (Now keep in mind that I was in the car for 12 hours prior to that and listening to nothing but the Penn Jillete radio show podcasts, so I had heard a lot of good stories that day).

Evan is from Alabama though you wouldn't know it.  Now he would take his car to this one body and mechanic shop out there.  Apparently all of the workers would make jokes and make fun of their boss, the owner about "having relations" with sheep.  Now the owner is otherwise a regular guy.  Wife and three kids sort of package deal.  Finally, Even asked one day about the sheep jokes.  

The shop owner took Evan in the back room of the shop and showed him these boots that he had welded together that were specially made to keep a sheep's hind legs secure "so they can't run away."

If that isn't bad enough for you, the owner went on to explain how to do the deed he liked taking the sheep out to the edge of a cliff to have his way with them.  He would face the sheep out over the edge of the cliff and approach them from behind.  This way the sheep would be too scared to run away and whenever they would get a glimpse over the edge they would frantically back up into his person.  Apparently, this increased the pleasure.

I wonder if his wife ever let him on the boots and pretend she was livestock too.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Judy was a daughter of Godlessness...Bob was a son of the Gospel...Intolerance versus Intolerance.
--Intertitle for the Godless Girl

This movie was one of the hottest films I have ever seen.  So first off it was amazing. Last year I also saw a film that became one of my favorites called "Girl with the Hat Box".  That one was this hilarious Russian slapstick.  

"The Godless Girl" is a Cecil B. DeMille flick and based on this one films of his, I think I am a fan.  Probably not in the way he was meaning, but there really were some amazing shots (like the cut away of the school house riot) that were chaotic and gorgeous.  

Here is why the movie was so sexy though other than all of the actresses being cute to hot.  Most of it took place in a "Reform School"  which was essentially a prison.  One side was boys and the other side was girls.  

One of my favorite (read hedonisticly satisfying) is when the godless girl Judy is being inducted into the prison and they forcibly cut her hair.  Now, her hair already only barely touched her ear lobes.  The funny part of the story is hat at first she doesn't appear to know what is going on and sits down and asks Mame, the hair dresser, to style it a particular way.  Mame proceeds to cut just a huge part off of the top and Judy's face drops.  At the end of the ensuing physical struggle Judy has this wild and unplanned, unorganized hair.  It is like some black mountain range jetting out in any direction the wind has shaped the rock.  Judy becomes an untouchable Daphne, at least until her hair grows back out some.

It should be noted that the uniforms are amazingly sexy. 

The audience itself was amazing.  They would boo and hiss or laugh at every intolerant Chirstian thing the Bob character said and they would cheer whenever anyone from the Junior Atheist club did something heroic. 

The movie was simply epic and you should really see it.

Philosophically, even though the movie was made with a Christian tone, the Atheists were only anti-Christian.  Now this is very interesting because all devout Atheists that I know or know of that actively espouse and proselytize their beliefs are essentially anti-Christian and never or rarely seem to address other theistic belief systems that to me personally make more sense.  So as not to name friends, Penn Jillete is one of these.  Now you can say we are in America so it is the topical group to fight against.  But as a coherent philosophy, this is really only saying their is no Christian god.  Now before I get off track an go on a logic using rant about the things that bother me about the modern Atheist movement, I'll make my point.  Most of the time I think Atheist project themselves exclusively (or nearly so) as anti-Christians, where as in "the Godless Girl" a Christian was portraying them as anti-Christian. 

We should all get together and see it at some point.  Ryan really like it too.  
And here I go off on a movies again..]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What do you call a River Rafting guide without a girlfriend?
Homeless.

Quite a lot has happened since I last checked in.  I believe that the last issue was about "The Godless Girl" which puts this at a full week ago. 

Rather than explain in detail the joyous occasions I had in the Bay Area (I am anxious to talk about the juicy LA tidbits) I will sum up my further BA travel by recounting this conversion between Kerry Prime and I.

Me:  It seems to me that the type of people into watersports are also the type of people into watersports.  
Kerry: You really need to be around more.

Kerry also had some amusing anecdotes about Asians in the woods, but we'll save those for another time.  

Soooooooooooooooooo  This weekend was amazing!

Like amazingawsomefunburgerw/cheeseLOLtehsw33tpimpmyridemtvamazing.

I went down to LA for my friend from high school Meenon's birthday party.  However, my cousin Andrew basically begged me to meet him in the Valley before going to the party. 

So I went to see Andrew and friends.  It also happened to be Twiny's Birthday.  Twiny's real name is either Kerry, Kari, or Carrie but is known as such since she is effectively Mowi's twin.  I had never met her before yesterday.  

It turns out Twiny is awesome and just moved out from Key Largo and owns ferrets.  

If I don't say this enough, I'll say it now and again.  I really love everyone in my cousins greater friend group.  They have been good friends and true throughout the ages.  

That being said, totally calmly while we were having dinner at the Cheesecake Factory, Kai (who was sitting across from me) asked,

"So how is Shaitan?"

I busted up laughing and then offered to settle this outside.  Ok, I lied.  Kai didn't say Shaitan, but rather something quite close.  (Hint:  It wasn't Shaihulud)

Unfortunately because of the Twiny festivities, I did not get to socialize with Kari (Andrew's new attachment) as much as I was hoping / planning.  

Meenon's party was most righteous and filled with hedonistic delights Shaitan would have been proud of.  I partook.  

Now, The real reason for this post.  

I was so happy this visit to LA.  There was so much love and warmth that flowed through people among both, rather disparate groups.  The similarities were staggering and fulfilling.  The old friends had nothing lost between us and the new friends gains were so subtly accepted that there was no, none, Zero awkwardness between us after the initial introduction.  I felt totally at ease with these newcomers even though I know nothing about them.  

Now here is what I noticed.  Both of these groups are also a lot more tactile than either the Bay Area or Texas crowd and certainly more so than the ever distant Santa Barbara crowd.

I think all of the touching and hugging and dancing and wrestling has a lot to do with this.   

To be utterly fair, my first hug with Twiny was somewhat awkward.  However, when I had to leave early from *her* b-day celebrations to go to my other engagement, Twiny got up and gave me an enthusiastic hug on her own volition.  It was clear my presence was appreciated even by someone who had only gotten into town weeks before.

Also Kai started to undress me in the Cheesecake Factory.  This was superseded only by where I was undressed later that evening ^_-]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Originally from the Texas Panhandle, she finished high school in Anchorage, Alaska where her family had moved.  Always ready to paint or travel she choose to study at the University of the Americas in Mexico City, where to her surprise she stayed for 20 years.  During that time becoming an English Teacher in her children's school was her next career goal.  Painting had to wait.  In 1990 she moved with her children away from the problems of the big city and settled in the little village of Cabo San Lucas, Baja California.  Now there was time to paint and travel.  Her first works were Diego Rivera style portraits where the many years lived in Mexico showed through with bright warm colors.  Eight years went by in Cabo and her children grew up and started families of their own.  One of her daughters married and moved to Santa Ynez and as visits began so did the urge to return to the United States.

Now a resident of Santa Ynez she enjoys painting this beautiful valley and its wonderful oaks.  Local landmarks such as old barns, windmills and churches are in many of her latest works.  The many years spent in Mexico are seen through the warm bright colors in her landscapes.

Unfortunately, Jenny has a terminal and debilitating disease known commonly as Papermill Vagina.  No known cure or cause has yet been found.  However, with your help and the purchase of one of her paintings, more monies can be dedicated to easing Jenny's pain and go toward researching this rare and awful condition.  Up to now, Jenny has learned to cope with her struggles by occasionally using her disease in her art.  Once a month, her vulva swallows one of the beautiful Santa Ynez Valley live oaks and she makes a unique canvas out of it.  On this canvas she paints her landscapes in warm bright colors.  Won't you help?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Welcome to the Papermill!

We watched the Rutles movie tonight.  My body is modifying itself in strange and disappointing ways.  I feel really healthy and my blood pressure is 92 over 59 with a pulse of 62.  The pressure is fantastically low.  I feel my pulse could be a bit lower.  Shane's pulse was 53, but his pressure was high.  

---Break---

Ok, I just had a big argument with my mom.  The TV was showing some monkeys that were being used in some sort of lab experiment.  She said that the monkeys shouldn't be tested on.

Now, Let this be said right now...I have nut political views, a lot of them in fact.   One of them I think is that I really believe in science and economics.  Whether this extends to what would be called faith or not I do not yet know...

So I made the argument to my mom that 1) most biologists and doctors would rather not use the animals and where ever they can develop methods that don't 2) animal testing has saved lives in the past, saves lives now, and will save lives in the future and has improved life expectancy otherwise, 3) animal testing in needed to develop methods that don't use animals as we ramp up the tech level.   

She still wasn't buying it so I ended up pointing out the she either values animals as much or more than people -OR- that she is essentially a Christian Scientist.

We sort of agreed to disagree and then mentioned as long as she didn't join PETA or firebomb research clinics then we'd be cool. 

Of Course she mentions that she was thinking about joining PETA.

Now here is where things got weird.  Neither her or my dad believed me when I said that PETA euthanizes their rescued animals.  Of course I didn't have enough time to show her this website: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/30/EDGC9DGTNV1.DTL

Now this is the San Fransisco Chronicle, which is supposedly the most liberal newspaper in the nation, who you'd think would be PETA fans.

What sticks in my craw about all of this is that I feel it is another expression of people feeling guilty about themselves or humanity altering the environment.   Naturally, this comes up a lot in power generation biz that I am in.  

As a guy who is really into systems and system dynamics generally the way complex behavior functions, it really always amazes me to see how little of a given problem people can see and still be wholly holy warriors for their cause.  I think very few people in this country really understand where electricity comes from in this country.  E.g. Electric and Hybrid vehicles are all the range in California, a state that lives on coal and natural gas.  

Now I am not saying that every little bit doesn't help, and yes animals need activates too   to argue for better, more humane treatment where ever it is possible.  

These issues are complicated.

Unfortunately raw emotion won't solve them.   Also, merely by being alive every single person effects the environment in adverse ways.   If one really feels guilty enough about these things than the most honorable thing one could do is suicide.  Killing yourself is likely the best thing someone can do to return the world to its otherwise natural state.

The revolution is coming and I want to live to feel a face that isn't mine.  Seeya in Three Rivers.

They were playing frisbee and it was most ungentlemanly how they were throwing it

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I sawr the Rutles movie again last night.  It was but my second time.  The funny thing is that the first time around I failed to noticed is that they have some Indian guy playing the George character.  

Mostly I have been working a bunch here.  Which ain't too bad.  

I have also been working out at the YMCA here in an attempt to conquer my stomach.  

The scale I have been using here at my parents house is doing wacky things and I am not sure I trust the one at the Y here either.  

In other news...
<table border='0' cellpadding='5' cellspacing='0' width='600'><tr><td><img src="http://quizfarm.com//images/1142421770ladies_and_mens_toilet_sig.gif"></td><td>You scored as <b>Either</b>, You brain is neither specifically male, nor female in the way you perceive your surroundings. As bad as this may sound to some, it can easily mean that you are capable of combining both  gender aspects to your advantage. Rather than being genderless you are possibly able think freely. This does not mean that you are bisexual or androgynous or indecisive, but it might.<br /><br /><table border='0' width='300' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='0'><tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Either</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='79' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>79%</font></td></tr> <tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Female</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='68' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>68%</font></td></tr> <tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Male</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='54' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>54%</font></td></tr> <tr><td><p><font face='Arial' size='1'>Neither</font></p></td><td><table border='1' cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' width='18' bgcolor='#dddddd'><tr><td></td></tr></table></td><td><font face='Arial' size='1'>18%</font></td></tr> </td></tr></table><br /><a href='http://quizfarm.com/run.php/Quiz?quiz_id=12501'>Should you be MALE or FEMALE?*</a><br /><font face='Arial' size='1'>created with <a href='http://quizfarm.com'>QuizFarm.com</a></font></table>

So I am androgynous...I think we all knew that, except for the beard.  

I swear somewhere in here there is an inner man that just wants to play football and fuck sheep. 

Which bring up an interesting point.  Growing up I used to look really effeminate and was made fun of on this front all the time.  Which was why I was so pleased to have facial hair.   Then in college I shaved for a brief time and within a couple of weeks I was getting "Excuse me Miss". The beard came back!

I wonder how well I could shake the drag thing again.  I'll need to conquer the stomach thing first to be really successful.  Halloween?  I am not promising nor threatening anything.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two (2) important things went down yesterday.

1) LARP in Irvine with Andrew.
2) The PROTOMEN!

I went to play in a LARP with Andrew in Irvine.  I played Razza as most of the others were Silver Dawn Chars.  The game was interesting and well run.  The idea was that we were ported to some demi plane with a room with a bunch of artifacts on the second floor.  If we took these artifacts downstairs, the items would activate and fun stuff would happen.  I died.  Trying to save people.  And then was revived so no harm, no foul.  

However I was playing Razza, and the distinct lack of anything to hit or any clear enemy made it not really my forte.  However, in typical Razza fashion I did crazy and silly things that moved the game forward with out anyone really realizing the accomplishment.  Not really understanding the idea of an artifact, I talked with everything that could talk.  I found a humanoid statue that had a lovely personality that told me they could combine magical things.  Being bored and wanting more death I took him downstairs to start combining ad nausea.  

I, personally, figured out the key to getting out of the demi plane (combining three magic tables) a couple of hours before it was done in game by other players and only after several hints from the GMs.  I didn't tell anyone else, because hey! It's Razza.  It wouldn't have been a high priority for him and other "more qualified" individuals  had taken over the magic combining fun.  Very tough RP session for Razza.  But that is why I like him so much.  He almost never does what I would do, but it has come to be exactly what everyone expects him to do.  

My cousin's new girlfriend, Kerry3, had heard of Razza only as "That Monk".  Have I told you how superb that is?

As far as the Protomen go....OMG they rocked my lobster.

They were so good.  Their opener, the Megas, were pretty good to.  They played almost all songs that were ballads from the perspective of the different bosses.  Really neat.  I hadn't heard of them before but will have to buy their album when it comes out.  Awesome prep for what was to come and it was even cooler that they joined in among our ranks for the Protomen.

The Protomen played their album basically straight through.  This was expected since it is a rock opera.  The Protoman helmet had a microphone built into it, which *is* the coolest thing I have seen.  

Now the most orgasmic, auto-destructive thing I have ever seen is when they played "Unrest in the House of Light".  The song goes through pulses where it is slow and Dr. Light is addressing Megaman and then where the guitar takes over and the place falls apart, and each time the guitar takes over the situation is a little more extreme than before.  This was echoed by the audience fully.  The band had complete control over this savage beast.  

It was nice to know that I am not the only one who knows all of their lyrics and blasts their sound in my car melting faces whither I go.  

All in all the concert was and amazing experience.  Anyone and everyone who is in Austin should, need, and, must go to their show in Austin.  Great times (and pictures if you are into that) await.  

I can't wait to see them again someday and now I really am excited for Nightwish (which we are all going to BTW).  Because as far away and lame as Tennessee is, Finland is much farther and a poor second to Belgium when going abroad. 

Kerry Prime once said something to be about respecting and liking the disconnect between the social climber, businessman sort of persona who is really into punk music.   

Hope rides alone!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Reasons to let MFs burn or To start hoarding your water like a Freman.

1) The Zaca Fire:  Where I am staying right now, at my parents, there is a huge fire in the back country that had a big surge today.  It has been burning for a month and will burn for another as estimates project.  The sky was an unnatural red from all of the ash that covered a half-space of the sky.  I went outside today and all of the colors where surreal and off.  The trees where a disturbingly darker green.  All of the browns of dirt and dried grass were red-fuchsia.  Shadows, rather than being black, where a deep maroon.  My skin was weired jaundice and sunburned color.  The sky was a fabulous yellow and red and brown and pink.  My mother is praying for our house to burn, but the winds are blowing wrong.  The house of Shaitan is close.  

2) Gantz:  My cousin told me he had seen this anime's first couple of episodes at AX and that it was wacky.  I just finished all of it today after starting it 36 hours before.  It is amazing.  Basically, selected people who die instead of whatever else happening they get transported to a room with essentially a sphere of annihilation in it.  The sphere starts making playing old exercise music before explaining the night's hunt to all of the new and (few) returning players.  Players get an hour to be set free inside of a 1 km^2 region of Tokyo where they try to hunt specific aliens.  Those who survive are healed and then get to live normally until the next game date.

Now that you know the gimmick, I'll explain why it is cool.  Let's start with the fact that I think there are Two (2) main reasons for watching anime: 1) Superior Art, it is aesthetically pleasing to look at in traditional and experimental senses, 2) Long running, contiguous story lines typically with adult and socially meaningful themes.  Both of these reasons are, for me, what distinguishes anime from other cartoon production.  That being said, I didn't find the art in Gantz to be particularly great.  I am not really a fan of the new style, computer made stuff anyways.  The story line rocks though.  Unlike Eva, which breezes through the battles quickly, in 26 episodes only 4 games were run.  It was much more like Slayers where there are these epic battles that go on like 4-5 shows...when you think about this it is an hour long+ battle sequence.  The Characters are similarly developed.   Also the special abilities of the aliens were exceptional and expected.  I'll put it this way, the fights (at least all but the first) were ridiculously hard. Very very very much worth seeing.  Very high on the violence and language count, which allowed them to make the most natural Shaft reference anywhere anytime.  The male main character named Kei did something stupid and cool and then one of the back ups said "He's one bad mother." and the other, frustrated because they were under fire, said "Shut your mouth!"  

3) Because of Gantz and the Fire I had this dream last night where I was systematically killing off all of the captains of the Enterprise in order.  Even people who were only acting captains.  I killed Kirk, then I got Picard with a nerf gun/football-thing in the mouth from the window of a moving vehicle.  I then got Ricker and then Data.   I forgot Troi so I will have to go back for her tonight.  Then I got the Quantum leap guy from Enterprise.  I don't normally have dreams I like (I only have nightmares), and while this was horrific, I found it amazingly satisfying.    

4)  I'll say this because it needs reiterating.  I thought I was crazy for liking Protomen.  It is sweetness in my heart to know there are others.  Let this city burn through the night.

And I am off to Three Rivers, catch you on the Kaweah or on the Flip side!
Peace]]></content:encoded>

Things could be going better but they really ain't that bad.  

We went on the very pretty Ladybug trail yesterday and saw not a single one.  

I wish I could write more but my time at this internet cafe is about to run out.  So I'll leave you with this.

At a Pharmacy in I bought a rubber ducky for my little cousin J.P. (John Paul).  The likeness of this aquatic toy was of the late, great Pope John Paul II. It was a big hit.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is too bad Lyra isn't Italian.

So I finished "the Golden Compass" today.  It is definitely one of the best kids books I have ever read.  The story is fast and engaging and follows a complicated plot as seen from a very convincing childlike perspective.

The real reason this book is a feat is that the main character (in fantasy terms) has one and only one special ability.  The singularness of it is not what is amazing, but rather what it is.  Her special ability as far as I can tell is that she is a compulsive and convincing liar.  

This doesn't really strike one as something that would be all that helpful, but it turns out that the way she uses this tactic over and over again is done with extreme deft and care.  Also it is quite odd to think of a hero as someone so weaselly without actually being an anti-hero.  

I look forward to picking up the next book in the trilogy even though I may not do it immediately.  I am in 3R and just bought a book that I have been eying  for a few years now.  This one is called "Conifers of California".  It is a very pretty and informative illustrated manual.  Odd the coffee table here we keep a collection of books about the trees in the park and I am going to add this one to it.  I, of course, have read them all cover to cover but the rule is that I have to read them while in Three Rivers.  I probably should tick off all of the trees in there that I have personally seen in the wild.  Better yet, it would be neat to take pictures with me by each one of them.  This would be quite the feat since some of them are quite remote and rare, like my favorite tree in the world: the Foxtail pine.  it lives only above 8,500 feet and there are only two small region where they grow, separated by 300 miles or something.  Most people that see them don't even know what they are.  

Other than all of that I am chilling in Visalia while my parents pick up supplies.  I did some work for my adviser, which could have taken a while but I managed to alter some previous code and bust it out real quick.  Teh sw33t.

It doesn't look like Sean will go backpacking with us...and it also doesn't look like we'll be able to go rafting with him.  

This funny thing happened, but you had to be there.  I was ^_^]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I just got back yesterday from a four day long excursion into the High Sierra back country with my brothers.  Many stories to tell and to write about.  However yesterday when I got back I was so depressed and confused after trying to read two weeks worth of LJ posts on my friends page that I figured it wasn't worth trying.  

Basically the trip went very well. Shane had never been backpacking before and Julian had only been on one other short trip.  They were troopers though for the full 38 miles of it (18-19 in one day hike that was completed in 9 hours).  For the occasion I bought Shane a backpack and Julian a Tent.  We were surrounded by Kelty gear to be sure.  

Of course no trip goes off without roles.  I was quick in assigning (and picking mine first) peoples jobs.  Shane was in charge of drinking resources and iodine.  Thus the nickname "Water Boy" was dolloped on him with a fair share of Adam Sandler references.  Julian was in charge of time keeping and borrowed my pocket watch for the trip and was therefore titled "CronoMaster" and was called by such whensoever his services were requires.  

The really sad thing about this trip was the Air quality.  It was hazy every direction but east.  Some was caused by smoke. Most was just pollution from the San Joaquin Valley.  

Getting back to the Santa Ynez Valley, the Zaca fire continues to blaze.  The sky was rust 'til two past noon today.  125k acres and $73 mil to fight.  And when you fight, you fight alone.

What is happening to my planet?!  

My feelings are best expressed as:

I want to have sex; It's time to fly home.

I know I haven't posted in a while.

I only recently got back to Texas and have been busy since.

On the other hand, I just got my new and much improved website back up.

Take a look at <a href="http://www.scopatz.com/">http://www.scopatz.com/</a>.

It is quite handsome and all web 2.0 and all that and I think more accurately represents me than my old website.

I start work tomorrow.

I haven't left my place much recently so I went down to the gym today and had a really good workout. I now weigh about 9-10 lbs more than I'd like.  But this is good.  This means that in a couple more months I should hit my target weight.  Idaho set me back quite a bit, but I think I have half-way recovered.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What is Non-Orientable and lives in the sea?
Moebius Dick!

So other than not much happening today, not much happened.  However I have made Two (2) really cool updates to my website.

1) I added the Protomen pictures from their Hollywood concert to my website.  http://scopatz.com/photos/index.php?album=Proto

2) I embedded my google calender for viewing onto my website.  It is under the "When" tab.  Basically this means that if you wanna know my schedule, you just have to go to my website.  Pretty cool huh?  Accessible via http://scopatz.com/#When 

I know would like to start a discussion though.  Here is the question:  Is it manipulation of other people to change yourself based on their actions?

Some points to consider:
1) It is clearly social manipulation as you are part of the social group and changing yourself has some effect not only on you but the whole group dynamic.
2)Does intention matter?  If you change yourself merely with the intent of changing someone else's beliefs or mannerisms, is that then manipulation of other people?
3) Does the contrapositive to 2 hold?  Namely, is it manipulation of the other person to change yourself based on their actions, not caring if or not wanting the other person to change?

Ok that is all, hotstuff.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Transport Those Neutrons!

Today is quite strange.  It is almost as if it was a full day of out body experiences.  Not that I am claiming that I have ever had an out of body experience.  Rather, I was more or less just observing myself.  Furthermore, being an ENTJ, I am very critical.  

I couldn't even do such things like go to the coffee shop or Japanese or play War 3 in peace.  

I think I am freaking out over nothings.  I am over-analyzing situations, The situation.  I want someone to make a state of Anthony's life speech for me so I can criticize. 

I think Devo put it best with:

Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom of choice!
Then if you got it you don't want it
Seems to be the rule of thumb.

I may just be having an episode where I have a lot of choices.  Because of this, I feel I am not always making or have made the best choices.  Or Worse yet, had an oppurtunity to make a better choice but didn't think of it at the time.  

I should stop listening to Devo]]></content:encoded>

And then she rolled it up
Rolled it up a hill
Like a ball of snow
Like a snowball grows
Until it gets too big
Until she lost control

Everything is fucked up
It's all coming down

Why can't you have your cake and eat it too?
Why believe in things that make it tough on you?
Why scream and cry when you know its through?
Why fall in love when theres better things to do?

A Glance, A Stance, A Broken Romance, A Disconnected Telephone.  

I've got to let you know, I'd cry if you died.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi all,

I am totally here and Totally made it out of my talk just fine.  I made a lot of very interesting observations at the conference.  I very much meta-gamed it.

I am trying to develop the persona s.t. people instantly look at me and know (implicitly) that I am meta-gaming but have them just think of it as an aspect of my personality and therefore not think of me as someone trying to extort/control them, but rather as some stuffy academic whose head is too big and can't control it and knows not what he does.  

My cover keeps getting blown by the fact that I do know what I do.  What then confuses people though is my willingness to play the game even after both parties have it figured out.  

The rate at which I am reinventing myself has considerably slowed down I fear.  I think my first visit to Idaho really shattered me and left a deep cleavage in the granite of my force of will.  

I feel so normal.  

I don't think that this has ever been a problem for me before.  What is worse is that it is easy.   

It is easy to be just some guy.  

I think the fedora helps.  What awes about the hat is that it instantly draws the eyes away from me and onto itself.  More importantly it draws the eyes away from my increasingly self-conscious stomach.  That is right folks, my abdominal area has achieved sentience and is rising up to over-take me.  Needless to say, I like the hat.  

People look at me and remember some man in a hat.  Not a guy with a beard or some such.  It makes me feel very man-in-the-street-ish sans street addendum hat.

Love is so easy to construct on paper.

The things that pass for Knowledge I can't understand.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw this young woman tonight at services who broke my heart of Plexiglas just by looking at her.   

She was perfect save that she would never go with me were I the last girl on Earth, I think.  

Also sort of along this note, it is a bad Idea to go to the Airport when one has not taken some time out for oneself recently.  With respect to me, this is about 36 hrs.  The throughput of bodies in Airports is huge and I always seem to find a good number of people I can imagine in various positions and places for various lengths of time with a various degree of emotional attachment with a various length of rope at my disposal.  

I met a man on the street today who was playing both the Kazoo and the Ukulele.  I gave this man a dollar.  

The other and final thing of note today was that I got to talk to Sean.  The following is an excerpt as related to the Super-Secret Project (SSP):

Me: So I bought one of those robot kits that you bought Julian for his Bar Mitzvah.
Sean: Oh really? Cool.  How far are you?  What can it do?
Me: Well I got to a certain point but....I am working on a rather involved subproject that isn't in the book.
Sean:  Of Course you are!

After SSP is complete I am thinking about trying my hand at writing fiction.  I wonder if I am any good at it.  Maybe I could write a story about a brave Nuclear Engineer who stands up to the world and destroys Idaho.  The clincher is that it would be written as a retelling of Gilgamesh.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the Facebook compare people applet is totally messed up.  

I know you knew this, but I will explain.  Currently my "Where do I fit in?" page yields the following results.  

1) Which I have complained about before I stand with 3/3 votes for being funnier.  Whatevs.

2) I "win" (term used loosely) The best dancer with 2/2 votes.  Frankly, I have no idea who has even seen me dance let alone what possible crappyness has been dredged up against me.

3) I apparently lost with 0/2 votes the most outgoing.  I think I am pretty damned outgoing (at times).  Who are these fonts of extrovertedness?

I spent most of the day in services as will be the fate of my tomorrow.  However I did finish my little book of poetry and prose which I bought.  Let me tell you it was amazing!  Who would have known I would have been so into it.  There are a couple poems that stick out in my mind.  One is entitled "The Chef is Delicious" and the other is called "Interview".  

The truth be told though, I bought the book for the first short story which is a very gripping and condensed retelling of the Odyssey.  What is rather intriguing about this version is that it totally elides the presence of Telemachus, is told in the first person by Odysseus himself, and contains this amazingly interesting part after where Homer leaves off wherein Odysseus in his old age takes a crew retracing the steps of his wanderings before returning home to die.  Amazing!

The other short story in the book and the essay as well were almost as good.  

It seemed odd that noone had thought of it before but in general there is no accounting for the bovine stupidity of mankind.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...Or the Zeitgeist affects the future too!

My life continues to collapse in on itself.  The only method of survival is to constantly rearrange and reinvent myself.  

Many tell me that change is not possible; some tell me that will to change and the inability to do so is just part of life.  I deny both of these.  

In truth I am not even sure why I try anymore.  Survival doesn't seem like such a great thing all that much of the time.  

I made a rather large decision today.  One that has far reaching long-term consequences.

Unfortunately, the secondary and tertiary effects of this choice were not things I anticipated and have proved very upsetting and unsettling.  Change is difficult.  I know not whether any I know will notice the long term difference.  I do know I was upset greatly in the short term, but I am glad my friends were here for me to non-specifically complain to.  

My life continues to be a cascade of failures.  I fight, but I fight alone.  I fight for myself, but I am not always there.  

It is time for a Turning, but in which direction?  Perhaps I will keep spinning into oblivion.


~~~Know This! I don't trust you! If you think this doesn't apply to you, it does.~~~


I am sorry, but you had to know.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry for being all emo and shit last night.  

Normally that isn't what this is for.  I have had a particularly rough Yom Kippur and the High Holy days preceding have faired little better.

Since my chaotic life is in a constant state of change, I have been fighting desperately lately to change for the better.  

However, as in the sermon I heard last night said, doing the right thing does not always feel good and the temptation to do the wrong thing often seems easier in the short term.  

To that end I have resolved to not hate this year. To say no more evil words.  I do not fear this change, though it has caused me some strife, in the long run it will do me good.


I have thrown down my weapons forged against my adversaries.  I hope they do the same, turning foe to indifferent stranger.  

Know that I forgive you, and I do so all the time.  I may only let you know once a year, but with every step and with every breath it is true.

One may romance the man in the street, but for now I will leave him be with his coffee, two creams, and three sugars.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My cat TK died today, or yesterday rather.  I haven't slept and the days all blur together.

This makes me sad.  He was a kind a noble spirit.  The heights of cat-hood were attained with that one.  Unlike most cats he was loyal to a fault.  He came to us out of the snow in -60 weather my father's birthday in January.  As a child he would walk us to the bus stop every morning regardless of weather.  He was the only cat I have ever known that I could teach to give me a high five.  

Beyond all of this he was premier in his love of sport hunting.  chipmunks and other rodents were everyday fare.  Birds, even doves, were larger prey I was happy to dispose of after the feast.  A gang of raccoons stood no chance when trying to steal his meal in the cold Hoosier wind.  The bell emplaced on his neck did not cull his habits, but rather honed his skill and carnivorous nature.

He was 18 years old.  

All material and sentimental artefacts of my youth may and ought be forgotten.  TK's memory and strength and cunning, however, has long been part of my psyche.

I was in a funk all weekend and no one saw me, though I longed to be seen.  

I think in retrospect, TK's passing was felt a priori.  I get these feelings sometimes.  I can't ignore them, though I try.  Then something always happens.  TO ALL YOU NON-BELIEVERS OUT THERE: This actually occurs to me.  Not that you would believe me.

I am a well-defined man, but I have no sense of self.  

The most important thing to happen to me this Yom Kippur was that I lost all internal purpose and motivation.  And now this, and I just wanna be alone; be loved.

Whatever next the world wants to do to me, let it pass for I have no fear nor shame.  I am hardly a person at this point.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I found this new (to me) website called http://grouphug.us/ 

It is basically the product successively sticking PostSecret and 4chan in a juicer and then straining out the pictures.  It has all the derision of the Internet Hate Machine and all of the depression of mailing in the messed up feeling you have to a person who will publish them and not pay you a cent.

GroupHug is basically an IRL version of http://www.wowdetox.com/

As such I am enjoying it thoroughly.  My favorite one so far is 

&gt;&gt;943097983  I fantasize about my guild leader. 

A lot of them are the typical relationship bemoaning ones.  The good ones of these are in how they tell the story since the subject is so used.  But most of the really good ones come out of nowhere.

&gt;&gt;905739078  i absolutely hate you amy. especially your giant nose 

I know I haven't posted anything serious in a while.  Most of what has been up has been *chan related anyways. I have been busy lately. Besides that my mind has been broken down by this thesis and various other spirits of past and present.  The present ones torment my days and the past my nights.  I dig a hole to bury the hatchet as Sisyphus rolls. 

Mostly I can't wait for this semester to be done.  I can't wait to get out of this city.  I hate cities, but I think you knew that.  I know it is Austin and all and the happy fun wunderkind of Tejas...but I am bored and worn out.  I need to get back to the country.  A place where I can see the stars.  A place where a damnable street lamp does not shine through my blinds.  

The good news is that my parents now have floors and wall in about 50% of the house (yeah my own room when I go back that isn't a closet).

The bad news is that the results of the spinal tap came back and no one knows what is wrong with my mother.  Similarly, no one knows what is wrong with my stomach, but I need a new one.  All of my dreams are still nightmares, including the wet ones.

In summary, there is something to be said for these WoWDetox, PostSecret, and GroupHug schticks...Trolling is fun and entertaining; actually posting on one would be a scandalous admission of guilt, even if no picture is available.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Stay Awhile and Sean Connery....</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I am pretty much back to normal.  Tomorrow I throw my two cents into the academic world for the first time.  

Recently I have been trying to take my limited knowledge of how people work and apply it to larger social structures in order to understand and predict those.  Naturally, I am starting out small with sub-cultures.  However, the problem I have already uncovered is that sub-cultures bleed into one another.  

Well, you might say, "Duh!" However, I assure you that it is not as trivial as that.  For example, one can be fairly specific and say "well I am only going to study myspace or how people comment on youtube."  That is a pretty distinct subset of people and their time in the US.  However, especially online but in the real world as well, there is so much corollary information availible about each individual user that further connotations can be readily applied.   

For example, if you look only at people who have camwhore pictures on OKC, this website provides tons of extra information and trends may be followed other than their implicit photogenic smuttiness.  In person, clues like dress, gait, and of course speech patterns are revealing.  

So here is my point, inside of a specific regime, using peripheral information additional subcultures can be identified that both exist outside of and within the regime.  E.g. Reading someone's craigslist personal ad, you can tell a good amount about them and predict many things that they are not saying (Meyers-Briggs). However if you read a lot of ads looking for say someone who likes the outdoors, you may also find that they have similar personality types or hair lengths and styles or whatnot.  Thus there is a distinct subset of people on craiglist who are outdoorsy.  It is then tempting to apply the outdoorsy personality type on craigslist to ALL outdoorsy people.  But this is a logical fallacy and there is a danger in doing so (though one would likely not be far off the mark.  

This is troublesome for studying sub-cultures on their lonesome, because no matter haw far you subdivide, another trend will just overspill into it.  How people coalesce into a sub-culture dynamic cannot,therefore, be studied independently from all other typographies its constituent members are in.   

So although I think I have a handle on people and how to predict (within error) their behavior, people in groups where I do not know all members is still difficult.  

Don't Worry, I am not giving up...I just need a way to not have to understand all subgroups simultaneously.  After that, ????, Profit!!

Any Ideas?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So it is that MEME-ical time of year...You know where you light things on fire, break out the latkes, dance the hora... 

Alternatively, one could simply post the first sentence or two from each months first post from this year.  Here goes...

...Or because my first sentences suck, we'll do the last of the first post...

The things I think of in the tub.
I have made a little box in my closet. It is equivalent to a shoe box. I think I shall go fill it.
I hope Kerry Prime feels better.
If you are going to go through the pain of having become that frustrated without release, you might as well enjoy it.
My desire for completeness or, lacking that, fidelity and MCNP are kicking my ass right now.
Furthermore the song is *not* on 200 Motels, which is the album where you'd figure a chain such as this would be.
At dinner at Anime Expo (which was this pas weekend) they had Four (4) Andrews in a party of Eleven (11). 
And I am off to Three Rivers, catch you on the Kaweah or on the Flip side!
I've got to let you know, I'd cry if you died. 
Busy like a beaver in an MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMF adult film.
But it is probably a trap.
In summary, there is something to be said for these WoWDetox, PostSecret, and GroupHug schticks...Trolling is fun and entertaining; actually posting on one would be a scandalous admission of guilt, even if no picture is available.

There, much funnier.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I finally after an excruciating day in the airports made it out of the City and into the Country.  I am at long last on vacation.

I would like to point out that the Denver airport is the most wasteful goddamn use of technology I have ever seen.  do they really need two internal monorails to shuffle bodies from one side of the airport to the other?  Am I cursed to feel disgust for humanity every time I leave Austin.  Misanthropy is common if not expected when going to places like Houston or some other soul crushing megalopolis. Detest in Colorado is another matter.

In any event, I made it.  

My parent's house is certainly improving, though by no means done.  There is now flooring in about 70% of the house and walls everywhere.  Tonight I am sleeping in the closet again.  Hopefully this will be the last time as we are doing a Storage Space/Guest room furniture shuffle tomorrow and then going to the bastion of civilization called Santa Maria to buy a mattress.  At this poitn I will then be in the guest bedroom.  There are no curtains in here yet, so I may have to improvise.  Furthermore, the toilet for the guest bath will be delivered on Monday.  

It was good to see my brothers.  

I wish I had my "song of ice and fire" books here...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I am still in the closet and will be for the next couple of nights.

We got a lot of work done today, but as it turns out, the door still needs to be finished and then put up and the grouter's are coming tomorrow and the guest room won't be accessible until Tuesday.  Which is fine.  We bought a mattress today and  varnished the door and did a lot of storage moving around and the like.  But really, in life, isn't grout more important.  


Also I forgot.  The standard fare of chix out here is California hot.  Maybe since it is where I grew up or there might a substantially greater image self-conscious out here, but the difference is Stark (Winter is Coming).  

The funniest thing that happened today was by far this iPhone advertisement I saw.  It is a normal lame add, but at the end they go to call someone (you just one of the feature of this so-called phone).  However, the person that is being called has alittle picture avatar of a vaguely azn woman whose name is Anna Haro.  With a name like that she should go out and become one.  I must say I didn't take Apple for /b/tards.  

The low point was either the Walmart electronics section -OR- Home Depot -OR- being called "Tony" a couple hundred times.

The weather today says that Chicago and Santa Fe will be the same temperature at 18 degrees.  But at least in Santa Fe it is a dry cold.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I am still in the closet, but not for the lack of trying.

My mom pulled an all-nighter last night and was not awake for to take us to the storage space yesterday to get the furniture.  Instead, Shane and I went to the dump, put polyacrylic finish on the bedroom door, re-hung the two doors and painted the guest closet a light pink.  All of this does not seem like it would take particularly long, but we spent 8 hours on it.  The job was made more difficult by the fact that it was raining hard today.  

The hight point of the day was when we were out of money so I offered to leave my little bother at the dump as a form of payment to the attendant.  Shane was not amused.  

Julian is still in school so our War III was limited to two games.  

Hopefully my mom will be awake tomorrow and I'll finally be able to come out of the closet.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah I am in the room!  

We got all the furniture from storage but it hasn't made it was dark when we got home so it hasn't made it into the room yet.  That is the goal for tomorrow.

It is funny being back in the Santa Ynez Vally.  And California.  Have I said that before....I believe I have.  I think one of the main differences between California and Texas is that the rich people in Texas are at the minimum respectful to the poor people at least to their faces.  For this quality I value Texas highly.  On the other hand, the unwashed masses of California are a lot nicer to each than those of Texas.  This is only true as long as the impoverished Californian is not trying to emulate their rich neighbor (which happens all to often).     

Also it is worth noting that the societies really don't differ greatly, but it is the little things that one can pick out.  Also, and I'll likely be reamed for this somewhere, but Southern California has often seemed a much friendlier place than northern California. 

This North-South split is true for a lot of the county though.  Idaho vs Arizona, New Mexico vs Montana.  My god! It makes me want to be a Southerner!  Even if someone is just being nice and they actually hate you, I think that is an improvement in day-to-day interactions to expressing their derision. 

It is a terrible thing to hate someone, but on rare occasion it cannot be prevented. Should you really waste that on the random person in the street?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[SO I went down to LA tis weekend and visited friends from college and before.  It always amazes me how old friends fit like a pair of old shoes.  Comfortable and warm, enjoyable and meant for each other are these relationships.  What I love most about these times is how little it matters what the two of you have done in the intervening time.  You just put 'em on and run.  

You are not friends because of the difference that currently keep you apart, but are friends because you are there in the moment with each other.  This camaraderie is refreshing.  The Post-Masters-Degree-Coital high was fun and lasted a couple of days, but I quickly got sick of it in some ways.  The fact that with certain friends it doesn't matter either way is spectacular.  This is mainly true for the friends that were spared the destruction while it occurred (Sorry Austin).  

Also I am always pleased at the selection my cousin's entourage makes in terms of adding new people to their greater friend group.  I have yet to be disappointed. Even if these are merely fair-weather friends, the sea is clam, the sky is blue, the wind is solid, and it is smooth sailing from here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have spent the past couple of days in sunny Rocklin, CA, which is a suburb of Sacramento.  Other than Sean, who I am visiting, this place is the Anti-Austin.  Basically this town looks like the perverse combination of rampant commercialism/capitalism crossed with a town that was built yesterday.  Every store chain you could possibly think of is within a 5 mile radius.  I could never live here.  On the other hand, Sean is here and that is awesome.  Also the Fry's Electronics is train themed and really well decorated.  

In other news, I survived the holiday season (does that mean we can shoot them?).  I am still no closer to deciding what I ultimately want to do with my life.  However I talked things through with Sean today (about our respective goals) and I think I am going to try to really do something big.  The option is there for me (I think/hope) such that if I worked hard and wanted to I could settle into a comfortable middle class lifestyle.  However, I think I can do better.  Somehow, someway I could make an impact on the US/world.  

I have a couple ideas on this front which I have expressed to Sean and mentioned to Seekatz, but enacting them will take a lot of work and be tricky.  Furthermore, in the mean time something significant but more reasonable may come along.  I am hesitant to express it yet...

Sean helped though I have resolved not to just easily slip into the academic world just yet.  To really distinguish myself I have to do something else.  For my cousin Aaron that is writing for Wired.  I am less journalistically interested.  I think journalism is a tool and I may be able to turn that to my advantage but not a means in and of itself.  I am still rolling ideas around in my head hoping to form a general plan where various stages build off of one another.  

What is really important about this though I think is that it means I will put off the direct search for Companionship+ indefinitely.  If all goes well, life will just happen to me.  Time to put the pieces together.  I give myself 5 years.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New York City is Destroyed, Again</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As every budding weeaboo (japanophile) knows the utter destruction of Tokyo in Japanese art is a common theme.  Beyond this, the occurrence of characters who singularly hold the power to destroy cities and/or civilizations at a whim is similarly prevalent even if the setting is not modern or futuristic.  Frequently this mighty characters do succumb and end up taking out whatever major population center.  For classic anime examples, Tokyo is destroyed twice in the Akira universe, three times in the Eva one, and is leveled merely as a plot device in Magic Knight Rayearth.  Perhaps oddest of all, major population centers are leveled for comedic effect in Slayers.

This is often perceived to be a form of emotional release of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Japanese in their art that is exported to the States never seem to address the destruction directly, but replay it over and over again with a different twist each time.  But as I said earlier, all this is known to your standard weeaboo fare.

A couple of points may have missed their OCD eyes as a well as those of the common consumer in the US.  We here in the United States have no problem talking about the Bomb.  Truman in his biography  even beliefs.  1) We generally believe it is good to talk about the past in order that it doesn't oppress us, 2) if not fully sorry, we are apologetic and empathetic to the Japanese people, 3) it is good that we got the bomb before the Russians or God forbid the Nazis.  I also think that most people in the US think that the Japanese method of subversive angst towards the bombings is unhealthy, not that it is really our place to comment.   

Ok, now cut to 9-11.  Now that we have talked (via the media, federal elections, commission reports) to death the terror attacks we are secretly dealing emotionally in the same way that the Japanese have been with the bombings.  

I just got out of "Cloverfield" and a week or two ago I saw "I am Legend".  Both dealt with the destruction of NYC.  In media outside of film, the book "World Without Us", which talked about nature reclaiming civilization should humanity mysteriously disappear, spent the first 150-200 pages giving a detailed example of how NYC would fall apart.  This is especially poignant since the author could have chosen any other city in the world to analyze.

Cloverfield was the most upfront about their social commentary.  In one scene, an extra says in the background , "Do you think it is another terrorist?"  In a similarly brilliant move and just as self-aware move, the main character Rob Hawkins is getting a promotion to Vice President which forces him to move oversees to, you guessed it, Japan.  Given the Alternate Reality Game (ARG) that surrounded and promoted the film, it is pretty clear that J. J. Abrams is fully conscious of his own criticisms and that they aren't just being inferred from this viewer.   

So are we destined to see New York City destroyed again?  Unfortunately I think so.  Americans (North and South) have long understood that trade and culture meshing is a two way street.  On this side of the Pacific, our lives have been enriched by the Japanese. Similarly, whether or not they are too isolationist or not to admit it, the Japanese people have been positively affected by our way of life.  However, in this one small thing, I am not sure the continued destruction of NYC is healthy.  In this case the media's overzealous, impulsive reporting might well save us from having art that flirts with the issue as our only collective outlet.  What's more, as long as the effects are good and the story interesting, I will probably keep going back to see more. Bing on the big guns!

(See I could have been a film major.  Maybe a shitty film major...)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here is the situation.

I am sitting in the emergency room waiting for Seekatz to get his stitches.  He fell on the curb and hit his head at Patrick's place.  I hope it is not too serious.  He has a headache but they haven't done any sort of imaging yet (x-ray, MRI) to know if there is any internal damage.  He was hit right above his left eye.  I got to the hospital at about 3:30 and he hasn't fell unconscious since then but apparently was doing so before.  Now we just wait and see.  Everyone else except for Robin left.  

I am pretty concerned.  However to lighten the mood we all took bets on the number of stitches he will get.  I have a dollar on 5 and another dollar on 8.  

On my front, I am taking Donnatal for my stomach problems.  It seems to be working which is awesome.  I would say that after only 5 days of treatment and working out I am down to only 10-15% bloatedness.  

However this drug is having some unintended side effects that are really annoying.  For one I haven't been lethargic or tired when awake, but I have been sleeping for 12 hours straight without waking up once.  This is sucky since I would like to have that extra 4 hours every day when work hits hard.  Hopefully I'll have learned to live with these effects by the time I am in such a situation.  

The second (super-)annoying side effect is that I now have a vastly reduced sex drive.  It isn't that I am not interested as much or that it is any less satisfying.  However, I feel less of the omnipresent compulsion that I typically experience.  This is disappointing to say the least.  Is this what being old feels like?  Knowing my family I doubt it.  Being the stereotypical female?  Once again, not in my family.  This experience is totally unnatural.  

But my stomach isn't bloated anymore....
And neither am I having sex......
......It would be nice to have someone to play with my piercing ^_^]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have such a love-hate relationship with the Warcraft games.  Specifically, their writing.  

Part of the time it is just so bad that it isn't even self consistent (lore, lol amiright?). This hurts my head so much I could cry.  

But then! Then there are these other times where it is so amazing I could weep tears of joy.  This happens to be when they do take into consideration their own extensive back story.  

So if you haven't guessed, I just watched the Zul'Aman trailer. http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/implemented/2p3.html#  This trailer is quite possibly one of the best things they have ever done.  When Zul'Jin says 

"And now, They [blood elves] fight along side the HORDE!?! I spit on the Horde.  I hate you.  I hate you all...."

I nearly creamed.  Half of it is the way he says it.  This trailer is still some of the best RP that any of the Warcraft products have to offer.  Note in the begging battle between humans and elves vs trolls that they are decked out in War I &amp; II gear.  

On the other hand, for Wrath of the Lich King it has been announced that they will finnally be doing something with Dalaran.  Wonderful.  Except this something is literally lifting the city off of the ground and floating it over to hang around ABOVE Northrend.  I shit you not http://www.wowwiki.com/Dalaran  

Not only does this make no sense it also removes the clitoris ala South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut from the game.  I thought they were gonna do something cool with Dalaran since they have so much to work with, but this is retarded.]]></content:encoded>

      <p>
      Action-packed, light romance maybe with situation humor but with a moral to your story, this Japanese master filmmaker would make your film an instant cult classic -- were he still alive. This is the guy who made the movie on which George Lucas' Star Wars is based (The Hidden Fortress). Also his movie Seven Samurai inspired the American classic The Magnificient Seven. I think you now have a hint how your bio film is gonna turn out. Rather than hire George Lucas, let's dig up Kurosawa to create the classic spectacle that is your life. A simple drama with light touches of comedy, but a big budget.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I can't find a link right now (of course, thought try <a href="http://outside.away.com/outside/culture/john-mccain-interview.html">this</a>), but I have repeatedly seen in various printed and online publication various checklists of all of the presidential candidates and their stances on various positions.  (Perhaps you know of one, Kerry Prime?)

Repeatedly, these studies have said that there were only two (real, not lip service) environmentalist candidates as I recall.  These two were McCain and Richardson.  Or Ole' AZ and NM as one might call them.  Well Richardson is out (for now, though please make a VP bid even though this will likely go to Edwards).  

Q. So What does Super (Not Monkey) Tuesday leave us with?  
A. McCain vs Either Obama or Clinton.  

Thus on the environmentalism issue which is closest to my heart, it looks like the republicans have won.  Clinton clearly is a social reforms candidate and doesn't care (which is why Bill had Gore in the first place).  Obama, from his speech at the Obamarama down here deep in the heart of Texas was also pretty clearly not putting the environment anywheres close to the top of his list.  He is very much an Anti-war, populist candidate.    

I dislike McCain on many issues.  Unfortunately, I dislike Hillary on those same issues for different or even the same reasons.  Obama, of course, is fuzzy on anything that isn't related to Iraq.  

If this is what the Presidential race has come to, I might have to go McCain.  Not that being in Texas, my choice in president will really make a difference.  My state is going to McCain with or without my electronically cast ballot.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are some Post-Partum Valentines Day musings.

Awhile ago I found  <a href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/128/2">this</a> article online.  At the time i sent it to Robin and we had a good discussion about it.  The basic gist of it is on a neurological level, primate tool use comes down to a subtle mind trick that other animals don't have.  This trick, as it turns out, is that we primates fool our minds into thinking that the tool  that we are using is actually part of our own body.  

The science behind this is interesting (the exact same sequence of synapses firing irrespective of  tool a tool being in hand or not).  However, this interested me less than the social ramifications of such a discovery.

It is easy to understand how we may trick ourselves into believing that simple tools are actually part of our greater corpus.  But what does this kinda thing mean for body modification?  Piercings, silicone horns, etc are all actually part of your body!  If you were to cover yourself in scarp metal (ala Tetsuo: The Iron Man), this would be your new body.  Your mind wouldn't know the difference.  

If this seams like a stretch, then consider some of our more complicated tools.  Nearly everyone has driven a car.  After a while driving and after "getting used to" a vehicle, in some sense driving becomes natural.  Think about that, driving is one of the most unnatural day-to-day experiences there is.  But we all know the feeling.  Very few long time drivers while driving think of themselves as explicitly being in a car, driving.  The car is, in the driver's mind, part of them.

Ok so that was all old hat for some people.  Here is the new, juicy stuff.

Here are a couple of canonical relationship phrases:
1) "You are just using me."
2) "Two are as (become) one."

So the amazing thing about this primate stuff is that it offers an avenue for a proof of the equivalence of those two statements.   Furthermore it means that 1) is not a bad thing and 2) is not sappy. 

Here is how the argument goes.  When people are physically touching and moving and trying to manipulate each other, each person is regarding the other as a tool in the primate brain way (not emotionally).  However, since the other person is a tool (in some sense), the first person's mind is thus incorporating the other into their perception of their own body by necessity!

Thus we have a situation where two individuals each have subsumed the other into their body.

The natural situation where this comes up is sex (though wrestling may count).  As with all primates, there is some learning time that goes into fooling you mind to thinking your tool is a part of you.  This explains why long time partners are more apt to say "You are just using me for sex!" and that "It feels right" and "I couldn't live with out you" with their spouse.  

The fact that there is a basis for these otherwise ridiculous statements amazes me still.

So go ahead!  Use your partner, because really, at the end of the day, you are just using yourself.  And that, my friend, is called masturbation.]]></content:encoded>

So, let's for arguments sake say there is an orgy going on made up of your standard god/dess build people.  But Wait!  Fade out and show that the orgy is actually occurring in naked pregnant woman's undulating womb.  No, no, make that three pregnant women who all share some kind of communal womb-orgy space.  And for good measure, the Pregos are themselves masturbating while they watch separate couple have anal sex over a table. Why Not?

I wish I could blame 4chan....]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night was full of lulz on WoW when I played with my brother. 

So we were doing these quests (Elixir of Pain, Suffering, Weltangschadenfreude (German pun call out for Trevs, Wat! Wat!)).  Anyways, we were on this one were you have to go feed this dog some poison in Hillsbrad fields.  

At this point my brother is a 22 Hunter and I am a 23 Warlock.  But this dork of a PvP-flagged 31 Night Elf Druid or something comes up and starts following us and making rude gestures and laughing at us. We weren't biting...

But then she goes and stands right in the stupid dog as I click to start poison it.  And of course I accidentally attack and PvP flag myself.  My brother, who I was telling to run, wisely stood his ground and kept attacking. 

What this jerk didn't count on was that we both had pets, I would spam every DoT spell I had, *AND* that my brother's concussive shot would stun her for a few second while we wailed on her.  

I died when she was at like 10% health and then my bro finished her off! So amazing! Our two broken classes beat a PC 8-9 levels higher than us!  And of course, I just soul stoned right back up and we were ready to go!

In my years of playing WoW, I have never heard of something quite that weird happening.  But the story gets stranger still...

A little later we were in Silverpine Forest leveling up my brother's skinning.  Someone challenged him to a duel which he fought and lost since he didn't have his pet out.  But we went down along the road and he wanted to challenge me to see what it would be like when he was ready for it....

....When a level 70 Night Elf Hunter on an epic mount comes riding up to watch.  Then as the duel starts, he runs up in front of me and causes my brother to 'accidentally' attack him.  Then the Hunter pulls out a rifle and BAM! one shot in the face kills my brother. (We didn't even get a chance to hit each other).  

The hunter then camps my brother's corpse and waits for him to rez so that he can kill him again.  I wait around and tell my brother not to rez until we are sure the punk is gone.  This guy even leaves and then doubles back hoping that he rez'd.  After that didn't work he finally left.  

In retrospect, my brother and I figure it was the same player that was soooooo pissed that we got his alt, that he hunted us down with bigger guns. Unfair, but lulzy.

So today, I went and grinded mageweave in Nethergaurde Keep.  Did you know you can do that without getting PvP flagged?  I was in their base, killing their mans, and there was nothing they could do about it!  It was awesome.  Take that Alliance Scum!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I should be in bed.

Instead I was up talking to Trevor about "A Game of Thrones".  Totally worth it.  It may be less worth it when my Quantum Test rolls around.

So I am seriously considering moving to Outland.  And by that I mean Sequoia. Pika Pika!

I'll leave you with a poem entitled "Who's Chemical Romance?"

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The past couple of night I have those special, less dry dreams that leave one covered in fuzz and good will for the world when the sleep finally fades.  

However, the object of these sordid hallucinogenic passions has been undead of various families.

Two nights ago it was with intelligent zombies (SYLVANASWINDRUNNER, AMIRITE?).  I did not even feel bad or dirty about this.

Last night it was with a troupe of small town lesbian vampire hunters and the vampire herself.

Now don't get me wrong, since I only have nightmares these dreams were horrific to the extreme.

But the sex was great so I stuck with it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So to explain my prior post.  I had this wonderful idea bout a month ago that culminated in some illicit pictures being taken last weekend.  

Here is the idea:  What if I created a female OKCupid profile for myself?  Aside from just getting an answer to the "What is my type of man?" question, this account would allow me to very effectively troll a good number of the males (and a few females) on the site.  So to borrow from 4chan, ONWARD FOR TEH LULZ!

Now we go to last Friday where I explained this at dinner to all of my Austinite friends.  The immediate reaction was one of both shock and hilarity.  Probably pretty close to what you are going through right now.  That night we took some camwhore/FGAS pictures.  Since then I have been working on a profile with Robin and Patrick's help (Thanks!).

While the profile is not done, it is in a passable state.  It is still a work in progress so if you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me.   The profile may be seen <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=javilina">here</a> (please check it out).  Note that the profile name is 'javilina'.  This is simply 'j' + 'avilin' + 'a'.  

Please also note that this is a total group effort (it takes a village).  If you want in or just have some comments or suggestions, please let me know.

OBSERVATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: 
1) While once I might have been more effeminate in body type than masculine, those days are sadly gone.

2) This is soundly the most intense role-playing experience I have ever had.  To create Javilina (whose real name is Jessica) required an amount of RP that can only be compared to method acting.  However, rather than being given a character I had to make everything up.  This is supposed to be a believable, independent person.  Every detail and decision should have a plausible reason for its existence and all of the pieces must fit together.  This is far more work than either method acting or RPing.  Even character generation for novels and other written stories must be easier.  This is because the story teller is giving the context that the character exists in.  The reader may then infer the details that are not given explicitly from this context.  My context here is <a href="http://www.getafirstlife.com/">Real Life</a>!

3) Some of you may have noticed that Javilina's real name is Jessica.  The MH crowd will understand that this is the only purely female (non-androgynous) name that I can slip into comfortably.  The rest of you will note that she is named after Lady Jessica from the "Dune" books.  Her guinea pigs are named Paul and Duncan, which is a dead give away IMHO.

4) Part of why I thought of this in the first place and why it works was because I realized that females (and apparently gay males) get a lot more attention than your average straight male on OKCupid.  However, before I started this endeavor in earnest I had no emotional attachment to this observation.  That has definitely changed.  At first I felt kinda dirty by all of the "stalkers" that javilina was getting.  This lead me to feel bad for all of those women out there who use the site seriously.  This, of course, is a condescending attitude and was quickly dropped. However the attention ratio &lt;&lt; 1 for the avilin / javilina profiles.  This got me feeling sorry for mine own biology.  Of course this is all for the LuLz so I can&#039;t ever really feel all that bad. 

5) Encased in all of this is really the whole story of how our cyber-society is evolving.  But that my friends, is its own post.  

I hope you read at least enough of this to get the gist of what is going on with my gender bending extravaganza.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Taking a Break</title>
		<link>http://scopatz.blog.com/2008/03/31/taking-a-break/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here a couple important musings of the day:

Firstly I have been really negligent on my workout schedule in the past months.  I really have been slacking off.  I really haven't done more than a day or two here and there since the start of Winter Break.

Bad, I know.  I have a ton of excuses (Winter depresses me) but I won't go into them.  The long of the short of it is that I resigned last night to kick myself into gear and make sure I burn at least 1000 kCal per day for the month of April and the remainder of March.  I figure this would at least give me a fighting chance of being in shape by summer.

So after my workout today I did the dreaded thing and got on the scale and weighed myself to see how out of shape I really was.  I thought I was about 150 lbs which would mean I was 15 lbs off of my 135 mark that I set years ago.

TADA!  After years I have finally made it!  I checked in at a mere 134.5 lbs.

Good news, right?  Well maybe not. Yes, I have hit my weight goal (which is totally awesome).  However, I know I have more body fat on me than I did in November.  I also know I am not as strong.  So what I think has happened is that I have traded Muscle Mass for fat.  Not quite the trade one wants.  

So my target weight may be more like 137.5, with muscle!  I think I can live with this.  My strategy of eating more fruit and protein and less carbs certainly took the weight off for the past months.

On the other hand, the scale could have been off and this is all a cruel joke.

Either way I will be exercising to become sexy for summer.  Here's to hoping I don't bulk up and my stomach will finally not hate me.

SECONDLY:  The new facebook thing that shows you people you *might* know has got to be the worst thing they have EVAR done.  What if there is someone(s) who you used to be in high school with who for whatever reason you now can't stand to see.  Even that quarter inch thumbnail might just make you snap.  

Normally, this wouldn't be so bad but there is no way to turn it off!  Yet!  

If someone isn't my "friend" I probably don't want them to be. Sorry Mark Zuckerberg, I don't actually like everyone.  If it suggested you as my friend, I would totally ignore it.

Alright, enough ranting.  Back to the grindstone for me.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So in my travels today I managed to hit three capitols.

Austin -&gt; Washington DC -&gt; Raleigh

Austin had the nicest airport.  
DC's was the most corporate and made me feel dirty and had the worst layout.
Raleigh's was the oldest and most ghetto. 

However, while I was walking to my hotel room I met a fellow who used to live in Hyde Park and shopped at Wheatsville.  Go Figure!

Most telling from this trip so far is that the taxi driver complained about rampant hosing development from a recent influx of Californians.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If I could shoot out my stomach and never eat again I would.  At this stage I would be some sort of undead (Wooohooo Lichdom!)  Do you think any of those hot vampire chicks would ever go for a whiny lich like me?

Speaking of inhuman interspecies relations, I saw an episode of ST: Voyager today where a hologram/AI had fallen in love with an ex-Borg.  DO NOT WANT!  The writing was terrible. The show was made of AWKWARD and FAIL.

To complete the nerdiness of this post, I am really liking Crisis Core: FFVII.  It is basically only the best parts of FFVII proper.  If you don't recall, this is the first half of the game where it was almost pure cyber-punk.  The original of course jumped the shark some time between when they made Red XIII an important plot character and the introduction of Caith Sith.  That's right the game was bad before the damn Chocobo training.

Seekatz: In response to your question from when we were watching the Star Trek: TNG series finale about a month ago I said, "You'll never know, I'll never tell you."  I'd like to add an addendum to this.  I was drunk at the time (which is what you were counting on, nicely done) so you'll excuse the fact that I forgot to tell you that you are still asking the wrong question.  Congrats for the directness.  It is certainly a winning approach.  Unfortunately, you are mis-guessing the subject matter.  I am sure you have some sort of timeline in your head.  However, your question assures me that you are still thinking too linearly, which is why my intoxicated statement still holds.  ARG'd.]]></content:encoded>

This is an entirely different compulsion than the urge for casual sex that been the unfulfilled mainstay of my Texas experience.  But a relationship! Oy Vey!  That is a separate beast entirely.   A partnership.  An investment. A giving up of freedom with respect to my peer group.

Do I really want this?  Do I really want such dependence?  Do I really want to care about someone? Do I really want to procreate?  Do they?  Do I want to alter my life plans to include an Other?  Do I want someone who will pretend to understand me? Maybe.

Maybe is about the best I can muster.  Obviously the answers all depend on a lot of factors.  

And though you may not have been able to tell, factors are what this post is all about.  

We all have goals in our transience, though they may not be so lofty as to deserve the name.  Some have the goal of joining the clergy, others of becoming scientist.  Sometimes our goals can be more base: being pretty, getting laid, getting high.  Usually our baser goals are steps towards other goals, like forgetting.  

More plentiful than the goals are our options, methods, ways, means, and factors that can be used to achieve these goals.  One may wish to write a song, but the number of instrument permutations available is effectively infinite. 

Ikariam and other free-form games and Capitalism have a vague sense of progression.  You want more of something and you start off with nothing or near enough.  However, there are many things to want and many ways to acquire them.  Individual strategies will be based on individual goals.  No two people could possibly play the game the same way; like life.  

Why is this relevant?  Historically, I have spent almost all of my time and research into furthering my academic abilities with a healthy side smattering of art.  I studies Aphrodite with Promethean desire, but could not accept the vanity of her embrace.  

My clear goal when I came to Texas was certainly not to date.  I did not feel comfortable with my body.  How could I ask someone else to accept me when I can't accept myself?  A paradigm shift in my values towards a more aesthetic me-ness took place.  In my self-loving defense, it should be noted that I can't accelerate my academic growth any faster than I already have, though Lord knows I have tried.

Thus the goal changed, as did what I was researching.  However, I may now be approaching the point where I can no longer be fully focused on this goal. Yet the goal has yet to truly be achieved. So while I approach it, the answer to the aboves should go from maybe to yes.

Yet even inside this goal there are have been unanticipated options I have available.  Initially, it was all about gross weight.  This is a good first order approximation but it wasn't exact enough.  I need to worry about muscle mass and fat mass as well.  I probably could have anticipated needed to turn these knobs, but the time has now come and my hand reaches out to grasp.  If I can get these variable in the right ratios and solve my stomach problems I will probably be able to really say, "O Hai, I can haz date?"

[[Of course we all have side goals.  For instance, I may have used language at the begging of this post that would subtly indicate that even though I am now interested I am apprehensive about relationships because of some past occurrences with them.   This would of course be in order to reinforce some notions about me I think you have.  Reinforcing such notions is naturally one of the better levers I have available FOR TEH LULZ]] ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The time has come.  This is a Action News 8 Breaking Coverage: Javilina report!<br /><br />First up, at one point yesterday I hit an unprecedented 162 stalks per week! For those of you who do not use the site, this is simply how many people have viewed your profile in the aforementioned time allotment.  <br /><br />Secondly, yesterday there were some simply amazing IM exchanges that I just *have* to publish here.  This thread is locked because of this.  I mean we can all have a good laugh at these people, but really should the general public?  It is not like we are Anonymous, though some of us may be traps.  <br /><font size="4"><br /></font><font size="4"><b>Conversation 1: <i>No Subject</i></b></font><br /><b>=====AdventureTeamGO wrote=====</b><br /> Every time I see your picture I think you're someone else. Stop tricking me!! :P<br /><br /><b>=====javilina wrote=====</b><br /> LoL!  That is totally funny.  Who do you think I am?!<br /><br /><b>=====AdventureTeamGO wrote=====</b><br /> Haha, I donno, just someone different. You tricky person you.<br /><br /><b>=====javilina wrote=====</b><br />Sweet! maybe I am ghost from your past.  I mean, as long as I am being tricky ;)<br /><font size="4"><br /></font><font size="4"><b>Conversation 2: </b><b>Question...</b></font><font size="4"><b> <br /></b></font><b>=====OmegaSupreme wrote=====</b><br /> Yup, I've been stalking your profile, and decided that I have a question for you now that I worked up the nerve to send you a message. Your pet guinea pigs...would they happen to be named after characters from Dune? Just curious. :)<br /><br /><b>=====javilina wrote=====</b><br /> Lol, They totally are! I love those books. You are the first person to notice it tho. At least the first one on OK Cupid that is. <br /> <br /> But yeah, I totally love Dune. I like to think that I am named after Lady Jessica even though I know I am not. (great aunt, whatevs!) But since my guinea pigs are like my kids right now I named them like they were. Paul came first of course.<br /><br /><b>=====OmegaSupreme wrote=====</b><br />Heh, awesome! I figured they had to be. Not many people would really come up with the name Duncan just out of the blue. :) So I take it your name must be Jessica? I love Dune as well, although I have to admit that I only made it halfway through Children of Dune. One of these days I'm going to have to start that series over again, and finish it this time. I've also got both of the Sci Fi Channel miniseries on Dune and Children of Dune. I like them much better than the older David Lynch movie.<br /><br /><b>=====javilina wrote=====</b><br />Heya, yeah Dune is pretty amazing.&nbsp; I really like Children tho!&nbsp; You should totally pick it back up.&nbsp; I dunno, I like both the movie so...<br /><br /><b>=====OmegaSupreme wrote=====</b><br />Yeah, what I read of Children was pretty good. I do need to start it again. BTW, I heard they're going to make a new Dune movie. Not sure what to think of that news yet...I'm not sure the story can really be told properly in a 2 or 3 hour movie.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok I am sure you all remember that about a month ago or so I made a fake OKCupid profile for Javilina/Jessica.  I am sure mostly because my last post pertained to just this.

Well about two weeks ago Patrick made a joke-I-didn't-know-was-a-joke-at-the-time over AIM.  "Hey you should make a profile for every gender and sexual preference combination."

My reply was a definitive "No. That is way too much work.  But maybe covering all of the sexual preferences would be doable and fun!"   The math at the time worked out as follows.  1) Me: straight male.  2) Jessica: bisexual female.  So the only two combinations missing from this scheme are bisexual and gay males.  These two birds can be hit with one stone: gay male.

So meet <a href="http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=flavilin">Mark Walker</a>, my gay male alter ego. 

Mark's profile name is 'flavilin'.  This of course is just 'fl' as in flavor + 'avilin' my screen name.  The creation of this profile went a lot easier but the role-playing experience is no less intense.  I even managed to rope Patrick into a bit making it an ARG of sorts.  

Mark is part of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_community">bear culture</a>, or certainly wants to be.  A bear cub shall we say.  This is tactical decision as I cannot swing the standard gay male vibe.  In fact I make a pitiful bear, but it suits.  

As you may have noticed, I have the horrendous U-mustache for the part and I actually went out and bought Texas Formal Wear (jeans and a cowboy hat) for the part.  

Unfortunately, I could not immediately shave off the 'stash since my friend Tony was coming into town on Sunday.  These pictures were taken Friday night.  Tony actually looks like a bear and taking some pictures with him will lend credence to my more ursine persuasions.  

So basically I have been walking around town all weekend with my ridiculous mustache.  While I was at I figured why not actually try to play the part in real life.  You know see how it works.  Mark is a much more explicitly extroverted fellow than myself.  Also, he is gay.  Needless to say I got treated a lot differently.  

Surprisingly, it has been ALL positive.  I am not treated like the nerd/pencil-pusher/academic that I normally swing.  People see the mustache smirk, laugh, but then respect.  Then when it turns out I am outgoing and nice, they are always congenial back.  I am not harmful or malicious or cunning.  The mustache disarms their defense and then they open up.  It is incredible.

This has happened with just about everyone new I have met this weekend.  It has been wonderful.  I sat down in Intellectual Property (bookstore) and had a 20 min conversation with the checker about Poverty, Sustainability, Children's Stories, and Tactics for Making the World a Better Place.  This is not something Anthony is privy to and not something Jessica is interested in. I could very easily get used to being in this brave new world.  

There is so much to tell but I think I have written enough for now.  Enjoy.

EDIT: Mom, you now have the gay son you always wanted.

EDIT2: I just added a couple of more pictures with me and Big Bear Travis.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I hate to talk about the results for Mark (remember him ^_-) so soon after actually creating the account, but the preliminary results are stellar!  <br /><br />So first off I have been receiving an amazing number of stalks.  From Saturday to Wednesday, half a week, Mark is up to 130 stalks/week.  Jessica (Javilina) in other news is back up to 196 stalks/week herself.  <br /><br />And then there is this guy, who is such a gem he deserves the rest of the post.<br /><br /><!--/t--><b><font size="4">Conversation:  	     RE:Subject: 4 or 5-Star Looks Match</font></b><br /><b>=====flavilin wrote=====</b><br /> Hey deizez,<br /> <br /> You and flavilin both rated each other 4 or 5 stars on looks. Congrats on the match!<br /> <br /> We let you both know as a courtesy. You can turn this off if you'd like, on your settings page.<br /><br /><b>=====deizez wrote=====</b><br /> YES! Hey. Most of my messages like this tell me that I suck because I gave somebody a one just to see the next person- well, cool for you, because I rock. Plus, I guess I think you rock, too, therefore the awesome message that we gave each other high marks- and everybody needs some love-.<br /> <br /> Uh, neat... I don't do Texas, but I'd do you. <br /> <br /> -Trotter<br /> <br /><b>=====flavilin wrote=====</b><br /> Ahahaha you had me laughing so hard with "I don't do Texas, but I'd do you." In fact I could say the same thing Iowa. (I had an Uncle get married there. I was not a fan of the wedding.)<br /> <br /> I am pretty sure that this proves, sir, beyond a shadow of a doubt that we both rock! <br /> <br /> You look pretty cold in some of your pictures.<br /> <br /> Cheers, <br /> Mark<br /> <br /> <b>=====deizez wrote=====</b><br /> A couple of hours ago, I made the drunken decision to make my first iTunes rent, so I rented the movie 2 Days in Paris... I love Adam Goldberg- he's one of my top three Jews. Did you know that in French the name Simon sounds like our word for semen? Gross, eh?<br /><br />I do rock, thank you. Oh, and the only cold thing about me is my heart. If that was a funny "Texas is never cold joke"... ... ...well, at least we don't live in Canada.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Lieutenant!  Is that *really* appropriate?" Sisko barked.  Her hands and arms had caught him by surprise from behind.  No one knew about their secret time together, least of all Jake.  And that is just how the Commander wanted to keep it.  

Dax had become more brazen of late.  He often sat and wondered if it was some sort of Trillian mid-life crisis, or menopause, or puberty even!  Her quarters were fine, the Holosuite was fine too if they could be guaranteed a little extra privacy.  Even his own quarters were reasonable if they knew Jake would be out.  But this everywhere, all-of-the-time business has got to stop.  Just last night it had been in the Science Lab.  Julian was right there!  If he'd heard her moan just once, that would be it.  Both of their careers would be over.  Now they were in his office and this was getting dangerous.

"Oh come on Ben!  I am the Science officer here and I am just collecting samples." Jadzia wryly smiled, sliding her hands further down the front of his chest.   Starting to unzip his uniform.  Tick.  Tick.  Tick.

"That is it! I'm.." Sisko started.

"I am Collecting Samples!" Dax butted in.  Pausing for a moment to regain her composure, "And it just so happens that I require some from an Adult Human Male.  And there is nothing you can do about it."  She said turning his chair around and smothering him a kiss that was not the kind to allow Sisko to object or even speak.  Her supple breasts touching his handsome man-chest in that light way that let both of them know that there was only more to come. 

"Alright.  I concede. But not here.  Someone could walk in at any time."  he pleaded.  Unfortunately for Benjamin, by the time he was done talking she had his uniform unzipped right down to the crotch. 

"Ah Ah!" She wagged her right index finger at him as she got down on her knees in front of the chair.  "I am the doctor here.  I think that makes me the master."  Jadzia winked.  

Dax was now cupping Sisko's lukewarm balls in her left hand and had partially unzipped the top part of her Federation uniform.  "Alright there little guy!  Come on." She whispered to Benjamin's penis as it was slowly going through the first stages of erection.  Unzipping her uniform's top completely "Do you need a little motherly love?" she said as she placed his cock into her cleavage, slowly rubbing upwards and down.  Resigning himself, Sisko sat back and thought to himself that if it is going to happen he should take it like a man.

Finally submitting, Benjamin allowed himself the pleasure of a full, stiff, 15" hard on.  Dax wasted no time.  She was smothering his dark member even more vigorously than she had him earlier.  It was unfortunate for both Jadzia and him that the Trill oral structure could not fully account for neither the Captain's girth nor his length.

"OoooH"  He moaned deeply and softly as simultaneously both her mouth retreated back to the tip of the head and she surprised him by ramming her pinky finger up his asshole.  There was an audible pop as her lascivious mouth separated from his head.

"Do you like that, baby?" Dax inquired as she rotated her finger around.  It was all Sisko could do to moan briefly as he felt the cool air evaporate the pre-cum and her saliva from off of his shaft.   Before any words could form she was back on him vigorously sucking and pounding.  

It was all too much.  Dax was always good at head, but this new finger thing was superb.  In a climactic groan, Commander Sisko expelled his load into her mouth.  Dax, surprised, pulled back.

"Sorry, I normally last longer." He claimed apologetically.

Thumping her chest and swallowing, Jadzia said willfully "Oh that is fine, Ben.  I didn't realize you liked it so much."  Dax stood up, her breasts undulating as she did so.  "But now for me..."  She forced the commander up out of his seat and then ripped the rest of his uniform off.  Then turning him around so his powerful back was showing she proclaimed, 

"Computer.  Strap-on.  Hot."

And there it was.  The replicator had produced a massive 24" long PVC shaft with harness, shaped like a baseball bat.  Jadzia knew it was his favorite sport and thought the gesture would be appreciated.  

"What are you doing Dax?  You have your sample.  We can stop for now."

"Oh no, you don't get off that easy.  Not after that performance."

The first unlubricated ram up his firm ass hurt the most.  He could feel himself start to bleed. Sisko knew this would be bad.  He wouldn't be able to sit right for a week and people would start to ask questions.  

"AWWWWW!!!"  The pull out hurt almost as badly.  And why was it so warm?  Is she now taking lessons from old bad white men farther up the Federation chain of command than him?  Still, it was oddly arousing.  Jadzia always was trying new things.  

Eventually she settled into a normal, rhythmic motion.  He even had started to get hard again, but by this point his face was planted on his desk and he was bent over.  "Alright old man.  That's enough."

"For you maybe."

"Stop old man."  The pounding increased, along with the pain.  "STOP!  No more!"  His skin was sweat bonded to the table and the increased frequency was hurting him everywhere.  "STOP, OLD MAN!  STOP!!!"  But she just kept going...

When Sisko woke up, he was face down on the ground.  Sitting up, he noticed Dax sitting by the window, smoking. "So how was it for you?", she asked.

"A lot like our time together in the Academy."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In case you didn't already know, <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/04/reiser-guilty-o.html">Hans Reiser has been convicted of one count of murder in the first degree.</a>

In case you don't know who Hans Reiser is, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Reiser">you should go here</a>.

And this is why you should care.  California recently has been involved in too many high profile court cases which the state justice system has completely botched.  First and foremost of these on my mind is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_%22Tookie%22_Williams">Stanley Tookie Williams</a>.  Hans Reiser is another.

The Free and Open Source Software community has long been one of skeptics and conspiracy theorists.  Furthermore, it's more prominent members often suffer from hubris and tend to get in public cat fights with one another.  Major and successful code project are like as not to be started because rather than branching an existing code and making it do what YOU need it to (which is what the whole experiment is all about), programmers are just dicks to each other and think that they can do it better all by their lonesome.  Hans Reiser was certainly not free from this.

However, in the case of Nina Reiser things simply not add up and it doesn't take a paranoid schizophrenic (or your standard Open Source Fan-Boy-Girl [Now with Both Genders! Didn't you get the patch?]) to see that.

Now I am not saying Hans is innocent because I *love* his file system.  I am saying that if I were a juror, I would not be able to in good conscience say that he committed premeditated murder <span style="font-weight: bold">beyond  all reasonable doubt!</span>

The fact that there is no body, Nina was having an affair with someone who claims to have committed 8 previous murders (which they didn't allow in court), and that all evidence presented was circumstantial leaves a lot of wiggle room when condemning a fellow human being.

Much of the evidence against him is damning I'll agree, but then there is <a href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/04/reiser-juror-de.html">this asshole</a>.  The jurors themselves don't even have a good guess as to how the murder that they are sentencing him for took place!

But what really makes me feel for him (innocent or otherwise) is when he said this,

"I just keep thinking that I'm stuck in George Orwell's 1984.  The government has taken away my kids, invaded my house, held me in solitary confinement and caused me all sorts of financial problems."

If you have ever had any sort of run in with the law, even a minor one, and tried to contest it, then you know exactly what this man is going through.  (It should be noted here that I feel the most for the kids since the state of California has now taken them away from their parents multiple time in two years).

Now, since the community is as described above, you will hear a lot of crazy stories.  None of them are true!  (Most likely).  Nina probably did not run away from her kids back to Russia, framing her husband.  It was not Microsoft that killed Nina to frame Hans.    It wasn't the Russian Mafia.  I am sure their are other ones, but don't believe any of them.

But just to prove that their is no justice in this world and not just in California, I will refer you to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/29/austria.cellar/index.html?eref=rss_latest">this mans case</a>.  He abducted his OWN daughter when she was 11 and held her captive in a 100 sq ft room for 24 GAWDDAMNED years and repeatedly raped her, siring 7 of his own children/grand-children, one of whom (of course) died.  And he admits it!  

And you know what his maximum sentence is?  15 years because it is *only* rape and it is Austria.  I am sorry when you you enslave someone, you should be imprisoned for at least as long as you held them sans any other crimes against humanity.

It occurs to me now that California may be having all of these problems because they have an Austrian for governor.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So my past couple of posts have been some what IN-TENTS, though for different reasons.  So tonight, even though there is a lot of serious ground to cover, I will opt for a more playful thread.  

I didn't sleep last night.  I almost wish I had.  But I had a very productive morning and day and I wouldn't really trade that for anything.  

My work (aka real research) has finally started to ramp up again in earnest.  It is awesome.  I love having nothing to do but to sit down at a coffee shop, in one of many hats, and hammer out some code.  I think my goal of having the vast majority of this code done and in the bag by the time I go out to North Carolina will be done.  Thus when we go out there it will just be running a bunch of cases.  Cases! Fuck Yeah!

My stomach hates me again.  I am determined to look awesome by the time I hit California again.  If you can't at least delude yourself into believing that you are sexy during the Summer, then what is the point in living?!  If I was a hypochondriac I would totally have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">SAD</a>.  

All in all, I am a little out of mind.  Think I could make a living writing slash?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So today I got nothing official but was very busy.  There was a lot of unofficial business accomplished, which was good, but I didn't get a lick of programming done.  I guess I studied for my final tomorrow.  

In other news I am really liking Brian Ibbott's podcast "Coverville".  It is one my dad recommended to be and it is a lot of fun.  Not all of them are hits but it has a better record than most webcomics. 

In actual news, I have started watching "Democracy Now" again.  I forgot how depressing it is and how awesome Amy Goodman is.  

As it turns out, I need a couple of really good one or two word puns.  If you have any, please post them!  Maybe you will win a prize if it is *really* good.

Keep it real.]]></content:encoded>

We passed this couple a couple of times.  <br /><br />The second time we passed them the young, lithe lady had the chutzpa to ask this question:<br /><br />"Are you guys Computer Programmers?"<br /><br />After a "who-wants-to-know" session, it came out that I in fact am, though Anthony and Trevs are not.&nbsp; But I could not let this aggression stand, Man.&nbsp; So I asked them "How did you guess?"<br /><br />Their definitive response was "The Uterus T-Shirt".&nbsp; WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Moral:</span> If you go into programming, you may not get any pussy, but you will get a lot of Uteri.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry if I haven't posted in a while.  Those of you who know what I distracted by, know what I am distracted by.  Otherwise, inquire within!<br /><br />I spent the better part of the day doing some MAJOR cleaning of my shower and tub.  It is now all sparkleeeeee clean.  If only I could get the kinda ass that Mr. Clean has access to.  <br /><br />But this was all in preparation for my re-caulking of the tub and replacing the soap dish.  This is a long time in coming so I am pleased by the progress.  Furthermore, I am doing it myself whereas I thought I was going to have to hire someone.  Even Better!<br /><br />Also in preparation for not being around exercise equipment this summer, I have taken up running.  So, YES.  I am one of *those* people.  You know the ones you see in their little UT shorts and cotton T-shirt that breathes heavily at crosswalks.  I am not sure how I feel about my new found status as I always silently giggled at my associates before I picked up this habit.<br /><br />To wrap this up, I will finish with the list of movies I have seen this summer and how I would rate them, WITH A COMPLETE LACK OF JUSTIFICATION (out of 100):<br /><br /><b>97</b> <i>Speed Racer<br /></i><b>85</b> <i>Harold and Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay<br /></i><b>83</b> <i>Read or Die</i><br /><b>80</b> <i>Iron Man<br /></i><b>76</b> <i>Re-animator<br /></i><b>66</b> <i>Hellboy</i><br /><b>64</b> <i>Indiana Jones</i><br /><b>38</b> <i>Prince Caspian</i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[/begin Rant<br /><br />I was rudely awoken this morning to the sound of jack hammers after a mere 4 hours of sleep.  But this time it was <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic">NOT</span> from my pool area which is being removed and worked on.  It was the from the guy's unit who *happens* to be the HOA Treasurer who lives one down and over from me.  Let's call him Dan, for various reasons (none of which being his actual name).  <br /><br />Background: Our HOA needs a good bit of work since the prior property manager company was screwing up.  The pool needs to come out, the fences and railings need to be replaced or painted, and a bunch of stuff was damaged in the hail storm.   Dan boldly stepped forward in order to get this stuff done. To cover these extra expenses Dan has assessed an additional one-time payment of $1400 to cover these expenses.<br /><br />This past weekend the pool was being jack hammered away and is still not done.  Thus when I was awoke to these sounds I thought that our little treasurer had some double dipping going on.  <br /><br />I went down to investigate.  I asked the worker at Dan's place when the work was going to be done and he said three days.  It should be noted that the worker appeared to be the same who was working on the pool this past weekend.  Same height, same skin tone, eye &amp; hair color, and both had mustaches.  <br /><br /><!--more So I sent out this message of inquiry:-->So I sent out this message of inquiry:<br /><span style="font-style: italic">Dear *Dan* and other PSC owners, </span><br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic"> A couple of points have been brought to my attention:</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic"> 1) The same man (didn't catch his name but is short, Chicano, and has a mustache) is doing both the work on the complex as a whole and on Brian's personal unit (#13).  </span><br /><span style="font-style: italic"> 2) This man was jack-hammering inside of *Dan*'s property.</span><br /><span style="font-style: italic"> 3) A door knob key holder of the type real estate agents use to place on properties is on your unit.</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic"> This brings up a number of questions I would like you to field, please.  How many more days will work internal to your property be performed, and at what times?  Furthermore, I am requesting a financial disclosure of PSC to ensure that no finances are accidentally mixed between our communal projects and your personal ones.  Moreover, are you planning on selling soon?  Also could you please explain the decision to remove the pool weeks before the meeting when it was stated and implied in previous emails that discussion of the pool area and region would be held at the June 7th meeting?  In general, the timeline given in the notification of assessment does not seem to be held to as you are already working, could you could also address this please?</span><br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic"> Thank you for taking to time to respond to these questions.  I am sure it will dissuade any fears I and others may have. You can rest assured that I will be at the June 7th meeting.  </span><br /> <br /><span style="font-style: italic"> Be Well<br /></span><font color="#888888"> Anthony<br /></font><br /> <span style="font-style: italic">PS I never received my in mail notification of assessment.</span><span style="font-style: italic"><br /></span><br />A couple of hours later, Dan calls me up and he is FUCKING PISSED.  Mostly because I sent this out to all of the other owners and I don't value him, and I am being defamatory and accusatory, and I don't have my facts straight, etc.<br /><br />As it turns out most of my fears were mislaid, which is why I wrote the email in the first place. The worker who was working on the pool seems to have a soul patch in addition to the mustache.  This was hard to tell since he had a <span style="font-weight: bold">gas mask</span> on all weekend.<br /><br />Dan, meanwhile is schizophrenic in his demands.  He wants to be gentlemanly and civil about this, but would then tell me that I "disgust" him and that I "should just cut him a damn check."<br /><br />As a property manager/treasurer this guy blows!  I remained calm throughout the discussion and insisted that it was just an inquiry and not an allegation, even though he kept demanding that I was defaming him.<br /><br />The real kicker is <span style="font-weight: bold;text-decoration: underline">HE DIDN'T EVEN READ MY EMAIL!</span>  The guy who he hired to be his property manager, call him Bob, called him and told him what I had written.  <br /><br />I'll admit, it may have been wrong to send the email out to all of the owner's initially (but this is still sort of iffy since it relates to their investments).  However, I don't think asking for financial disclosure and addressing concerns is wrong.  <br /><br />After I got the full story I wrote a full apology and explanation to all of the owners again allaying my concerns and fears.<br /><br />Basically I don't think what I did or wrote or said was racist, or lazy, or insulting in any way.  I understand how someone attacking me would construe it as such.  <br /><br /><b>So my question for YOU is do you think what I wrote was an inquiry or an accusation, in both the legal and intra-personal senses? </b><br /><br />/end Rant]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So in case you didn't know, my *real* Myers-Briggs typography is XNXJ.  The first X denotes that I am neutral on the Introvert-Extrovert fronts.  The second X denotes a simultaneous Thinking-Feeling front.  

Most of the time (depending on friend group) I affect a ENTJ type.  This is because this is the most advantageous type to have in dealings with other.  People tend to trust extroverts (usually wrongly) more initially.  Furthermore, "Thinking" people tend to get the more academic and scientific and higher paying jobs than those "Feeling" types.

However, there are those times, where for whatever reason, I affect a different personality type.  Certainly around my cousins I am an INTJ.  I am an XNFJ with my parents.

Yet, people have always seemed to notice and possibly get concerned when I switch personality types while they watch on.  Especially when I make the full flip and go to INFJ.  I understand your response to this, but it is nothing to be worried about.  I am not sad, just different.  

To help you on your way, when I am in this other, fully natural mode of expression and feeling, I just want to be treated kindly.  I strive for communication and understanding.  I am a little lonely right now, but that is because Trevor left me.  

In summary, I don't want people to understand me, I just want them to accept me for who I am.  Me and my fluctuating Id.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Origins of Cannonical D&amp;D Spells</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As you may or may not know, there was once a time when Dungeons &amp; Dragons and related role-playing games were based on <i>actual</i> mythology.  I think it would be an interesting exercise and possible academic article to denote some of this explicitly.  Specifically, in the realm of magic and its use in game.  Many of the original spells and items come directly from things out of a greater mythological structure, whether they acknowledge this or not.  So without further ado, <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Wish -</span> This is basically a gimme.  The wish spell is near an exact replica of the various Djinn appearing throughout Arabian folklore.  Of course western traditions re-appropriated it in with translations of A Thousand and One Nights.  Aladdin is the most notable example.  The fact that the wish spell functions mechanically to screw over headstrong players is reflected in the stories.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sleep -</span> This is one of the more interesting examples.  Most players might think that this spell is just an obvious, low-level tactical.  However, it really has a deep historical basis.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Invisibility - </span>This spell is arguably one of the most ancient.  The word itself is arguably the Roman translation of a god.  Invisibility directly from the Helm of Hades, used most notably in the Trojan Wars.  This items imparts invisibility unto its user.  An important linguistic note is that the word Hades is thought to be the combination of the aspirated alpha privative with the "ides", or sight.  Thus Hades is literally the unseen.  This has interesting social implications for the ancient Greeks which we won't delve into here.  These subtleties are mostly overlooked in the game.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Alter Self/Other -</span> These spells occur throughout almost all of mythology.  For example, many people do not realize that Merlin had the ability to alter his appearance to that of youths, maids, and other persons at will.  Athene, of course, changes the appearance of Odysseus to that of an old begger in order that he may slay Penelope's suitors.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Hex (Curse) -</span> Additionally curses are placed on many characters throughout stories.  The Gorgons being cursed by Athene.  Morgana le'Fey handed these out like candy.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Flesh to Stone - </span>Speaking of the Gorgons, this spell is an exact copy of their supernatural gaze.  The reverse of this spell is of course triggered by slaying the monster.  However, Stone to Flesh is also used in the story of Hephaestus and Pygmalion.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Augury - </span>This spell is the clear domain of Apollo through his oracles.  Higher divination magics are not expressed in mythos, as the future is unknowable.  However, the trance-induced visions do give vague notions about what is to come.  Generally a "Weal or Woe" as cryptically as possible.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Lightning Bolt - </span>This is one of the few evocation spells that is tossed around.  It is wielded by the such power houses as Odin, Thor, and Zeus.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Major Transmutations - </span>A few select individuals are able to cause full changes to their person.  They tend to be deities rather than mortal casters.  Zeus even goes so far as to impregnate people while in alternate forms. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Locate Object - </span>Saint Anthony of Padua has an impressive list of patronages.  Among these are lost items and seekers of lost things.  If there is a divinely inspired reason these, then it bears inclusion on this list.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Divination - </span>This power was wielded by soothsayers and their like throughout many traditions.  However, few had true innate ability on the level with this spell.  And none more so than the blind seer Tiresias.  His punishment for such power is that of his blindness. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Fly - </span>Flight is never conferred directly in legend.  Icarus gains it through the creation of artificial wings.  Hermes is granted flight through winged boots.  Sinbad is content to hitch rides on Rocs.  <br /><br />This is all I can think of for now.  I'll update as I think of more.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has now been two years.&nbsp; Since I moved to Texas.&nbsp; And Such.&nbsp; This represented a Pair-Of-Dig-'em Shift in my relationships so it is worth mentioning.&nbsp; With the temporary move to North Carolina, and the mass exodus of the friend group here in Austin, It seems like this is as good of a time as any to end this Loveless Era.

I talked to Jessie for the first time in like 4 years today.&nbsp; It was amazing.&nbsp; It was so good to hear from her, and after so long.&nbsp; Such reunions don't normally fill me with such joy.&nbsp; But she is special in that way that I think that only Sean is special otherwise.&nbsp; And that slash that you ferkakte kids wrote about us in high school is patently false.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding "those" people is hard.

It has also been two years since UCSB.&nbsp; The Game; you just lost.&nbsp; C-C-Combo Breaker!

So in summary I feel a lot better about future prospects and past veins.&nbsp; All that is left is to find new women, and I think the Indian waiter I had in Santa Fe said it best with "Put my sweet love in [their] desert."

PS: she couldn't believe the nipple piercing or the short hair thing.]]></content:encoded>

I have made it to Baton Rouge.  It took me a mere four hours to back and leave.  This is duly impressive since I am going to be gone for ~3 months.

I miss Austin.  I miss Texas.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I went from Baton Rouge to Jacksonville today.  This took me through Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and finally Florida.  

So much swamp!

The high point of the drive today was when, after a sunny morning, there started a light rain.  I had my top down of course.  But the rain wasn't even so bad as to require my whipper blades to be turned on.  I saw that there were some storm clouds in the distance. But I hoped I could power through them without pulling over and putting the top up.  

As it happens, when I hit the cloud, the light sprinkled instantly turned to sheets.  Not only did my windshield become opaque, but also I could no more see through my glasses.  And I was wet.  And going eighty or so.  I do not recommend this to anyone.  Exciting!

Other than that, I don't have much to report except that the people I have met, have in general, been of a ruder spirit, or meaner demeanor, than I have grown accustomed to.  Florida is the nicest, but they are still shocked and disoriented when I ask how their day is.  Lord save me when I go back to the Bay Area.  Perhaps North Carolina will temper me somewhat!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Amazingly, I went to my first coffee shop in Raleigh tonight.  (Huge shock I know...)

Even more amazingly I believe I discovered this town's version of Little City [the Austin gay cafe for those not in the know].  Hilarious and providential that the first place I randomly choose that has both free WiFi and suitable hours is  of this type.

Only here, I didn't get the stares, or at least that many.  If anything, for whatever cultural or subcultural reasons *I* am the one who is overdressed!  And I am just wearing my typical grad school cosplay.  I did't even have my fedora on!  

All in all, the coffee was good.  However it was difficult to get work done here.  The music was very loud where I was sitting and there was a retarded amount of eye candy.  There were at least five (5) "You, Me, No Questions Asked" types in the room.  And really, how often does that happen to anyone?!

In summary, I am torn on whether to go back between productivity and how Mark feels about Twain.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mystery/Detective novels were originally called "enigma novels".  The distinctly British term was then used to describe the cipher machines of the Nazis during World War II.  <br /><br />Amazingly, I brought a lone book with me on this 3 month journey from home.  This is the "Cyberculture Studies" book that I picked up a bit ago.  Cyberspace is a bit of an enigma itself.  It is both democratizing and exclusive.  It is a broadcast framework with individualized content.<br /><br />Part of the book develops a healthy description of how our current society is developing into increasingly segregated, interdependent, warring parts.  These parts are the exclusive networked peoples, those retaining the post-industrial lifestyle common, and the poor/criminal.<br /><br />The networked folk lead essentially a self-similar life.  Their many jobs require them to be highly transient.  Thus they exist nowhere in terms of permanent homes.  But the places were they are become similar to one another to provide them with the illusion of home.  I wish I could say that this did not resonate.<br /><br />As the applied physicist of social theory, knowing this isn't meaningful unless empirically tested.  Real rigor is left to the experts and those with funding.  But backyard experimentation is top shelf of those waxing natural philosophic.  Thus here is my abstract.<br /><i><b><br />At least half of the stories in "The Game" by Neil Strauss are likely outright lies.  However, the analogy between cybercultural networks and that of interpersonal sexual networks is not unfounded.  Relationship culture is highly networked.  Furthermore, there is a large portion of the population that exists outside of this network (parallel to the poor and post-industrial).  Even though the structure of the system is self supporting nodes, individuals exhibit strong taste which narrows them from the group as a whole (personalized content).  Even cornerstone concepts such as anonymity in cyberculture can apply in the meatspace of relationships.  Thus knowing that I am "in" the cybernetwork but not within the relationship network, analogous tools should allow me access to this sphere as well. <u>In other words, social engineering at the relationship level is possible through cybernetic parallels in combination with the interpersonal social group tools developed on my friends.  </u></b></i><br /><br />All of this really only serves to get me more ass, which is truly what it is all about.  Some proof of concept work is clearly apparent with the OK Cupid work.  I must become more enigmatic in my personality.&nbsp; I have gotten fairly good at reading people with a small amount of observation.&nbsp; <b>Thus I think a good first strategy is to read people and then alter my personality to one that I know the other person implicitly desires, before they catch on to what I am doing.&nbsp; This creates new nodes and flows in the relationship network.</b>&nbsp; I guess you will have to trust that I won't be nefarious in my methods.  Nice guys finish last, but that doesn't imply that bad guys <i>always</i> finish first.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh My!&nbsp; It was at least everything I thought it would be!&nbsp; Dweezil did some serious channeling of his father, and is hands down one of the best guitarists I have ever seen.<br /><br />The show lasted a staggering 3 hours, after which I could not really hear.&nbsp; The girl standing next to me took off her panties and threw them at Dweezil as one is like to do at these sorts of events.&nbsp; <br /><br />PROS:&nbsp; Amazing music, some almost even had a hint of metal in it, A huge portion of the show was dedicated to "Joe's Garage".<br /><br />CONS:&nbsp; They didn't play "Peaches"!&nbsp; If you ever wanted to see penises, just wear x-ray glasses to that show.<br /><br /><b>All in all, it was great.&nbsp; They played sort of an album version of the song "Joe's Garage", an amazing live rendition of&nbsp; "G-Spot Tornado", and they did NOT play "The Torture Never Stops".&nbsp; You would have loved it.</b>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have long been a proponent that the differences between us are minimal.  I do not intend on changing this stance, not just yet.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7456588.stm">But there are things that make you go "Huh?"</a>

Most of my first person evidence that people communicate is the same way is based off of me myself communicating with boys, men, and bisexual girls and women (mother, girlfriends, lesbian friends of my mother).  Now there is a distinct difference between homosexuality and bisexuality.  However since this study is more or less preliminary we will unfairly lump everything together.

My main point is that my perception that everyone is the same or similar *could* be just a product of selective experiences.  I *may* have even been raised to be predisposed to these selective experiences.  Have I then in some way been disadvantaged?  Are my expectations of how women should communicate skewed?  Is my dogmatic belief that people are more alike than different have no bearing on reality?

I am open to further inquiry, since abandoning the pursuit of equality should not be done lightly.  Interestingly enough, the researchers themselves take their results to mean that homosexuality is in fact nature and not nurture.  I am not sure that this really holds since they are not (from what it seems) testing over a large range of ages and developments.  Still, the work does lead to a host of other questions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Because I have access to cable w/ out Comedy Central here in Raleigh, there has been a lot of time with Adult Swim &amp; Lifetime on in the background.  We'll skip over the Lifetime and focus only on Adult Swim.  Only about half of the shows are worthwhile, but it has lead to some odd attractions.

1) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Girlfriend">Dr. Girlfriend</a>:  I have yet to even see a show with her in it, as I have only seen commercials.  For some reason I find this character incredibly hilarious and attractive.  It might be the Jackie Kennedy thing, who knows.  I would propose to the first girl that dresssed like a nurse for me all the time.

2) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oblongs">Creepy Susie</a>: From the Oblongs, this character has two things only going for her: she's goth and her incredibly sexy accent.  Unfortunately the voice actor is older than my mom....but that voice!  I never had a thing for the French before.

Lastly, despite his Dan affectations,  Mr Savage is amazing.  Now if only I could find a girl who would indulge my French Nurse animated fantasies.  I cook, I clean, I like the Kinks.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[George Carlin once wrote that "the wrong two Beatles died first."  

I realize he was older and that these things happen.  But it is still sad to see him go.  He was one of the few comedians left of his era.  

You'll likely hear a lot of talk about him being a free-speech advocate, and not *just* a funnyman.  In truth he was both.  Of the crowd that was Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, I can only name Paul Krassner as still alive.

Of course, others carry on this torch.  Penn &amp; Teller carry on this tradition.  I would be lying if I said these comedians did not affect my conceptual continuity.

On the other hand I bought some chocolate covered sunflower seeds.  Eating them is so tasty and sacrilegious.  Almost as if I am deflowering them....]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I held off on writing this for a couple of days.  

More or less the situation is that I owe money all over the country and no one (financial institution) is willing to help until payday or afterwards.  For a while there were serious doubts about me being able to fund getting home / continue paying for the hotel here.  

It isn't that I am not owed the money. I will be reimbursed, eventually.  But I wasn't sure I had the credit to live on.  Then of course there are the host of other burdens that I won't get into.

I have, sadly, gotten good at this so I remained calm and it didn't really bother me, on a conscious level.  But something was definitely triggered inside.  For a few days there I was fully distended.  Like fully to the max limit distended.  No drugs or amount of calming myself down worked (I was already calm).  

I haven't been this bad in a while, but all of the old symptoms reemerged.  I was fatigued, had an insatiable headache, trouble moving, self-esteem problems, severe pain, and constipation.  I swear I am the only man whose ribs show when he lifts his arms and whose belly looks pregnant at the same time.  It is unnatural I tell ye'!

I more or less waited it out in bed.  

1) I bought a book and have gotten through a good portion of it.  "A History of the Jews" by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Johnson_(writer)">some goy</a>.  It a good, stuffy, and academic History that I have been wanting.  Not afraid to say what the archeology supports and doesn't support.  Unfortunately also not afraid to draw the occasional parallel between unrelated new and old testament folks.  

2) I tried playing Crisis Core, but it bored me since I had already beaten it.

3) Tried to play the original Dynasty Warriors on my PSP.  Beat a map or two but it is so inferior to the game play of the new ones that I just don't think I will be able to get through it.  Once and a while maybe to feed my hack-n-slash addiction.  Also since I bought the copy used it came without the liner notes.  I only was able to beat the first map or two on the first try because I had gotten so good at Gundam.  

4) Willing watched Star Trek: TNG for the first time in a long while....And only because I came in on the episode where Picard --&gt; Borg.  And then they did a Data-Lore episode.  Amazingly they used some of Troi's broken abilities so I wasn't screaming at her the whole time.  I think this helped more than anything.

Wish me health.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw Wall-E last weekend with AJ.  

This film in the first 20 minutes does some serious Silent Film channeling.  Portions are even slapstick.  Very interesting to see this emerge.  What is perhaps more intriguing is that these same opening bits were also quite cyber-punk.  I almost wanted to burst out in song ("These Are A Few of My Favorite Things").

More or less, the Earth's surface had been destroyed through pollution and all that remained were the left over trash.  Even the movies premise, that a lone sentient being (Wall-E itself) is left to fend for sustenance on society's discarded scraps, serves to reinforce this cyber-punk theme.  The sky and ground are the same diseased yellow-brown.  It is all soul crushingly lovely. 

The movie seems to do a full turn around with the entry into "clean" space.  However, this is nothing more than a trick of the eyes, an illusion.  One cyber-dystopia is replaced by another.  The society on the Axiom spacecraft is oppressive and sterile. It is new-speaked  to the point that people do not even realize that there are other human beings next to them.

Hollywood has a problem with letting dystopic futures track all the way through a film.  But for a solid hour or so, we were in a world not worth living in where only the cyborgs survive and only robots are capable of love.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wooohooo! I am officially now on vacation!

We  have a publication ready to submit in just a few weeks! If you know anything about Academia, this is very fast.  And now that it is done I am Freeeeeeeee.........

I will be here on the eastern seaboard until the Saturday 5th.  From there I head to Council Bluffs, Iowa until the Wednesday the 9th.  

But after that I have the option, and have cleared it with mommy-dearest, of going to the Bay Area for a few days.  I am not sure how long it will take me to drive from Iowa to SF/Morgan Hill but I would expect to be there on Friday the 11th.  

So if you are going to be in town and if anyone is organizing a Silent Film Festival run let me know.  

If I do come to the Bay Area this weekend, be forewarned, that this will be my only visit this summer.   Hope to seeya there!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Iowa, in general, is still very blaaaaah.  Not nearly as bad as my visit that you may recall from past trips.  

But this time I have baby cousins!  And an Aunt and an Uncle and a Grandmother!  It is very pleasant.  It has been so long since I have been around the wee little people.  Very refreshing.  

Charles looks very similar to us tres hermanos as newborns.  And I have almost called John by "Julian" a couple of times.  That has got to be some suppressed memory of somewhere.   There are other freaky coincidences that only my family members would get ("Sprinkles", anyone?).  

I am more or less contented being out here.  Here is an update on my possible schedule:
-Leave IA on Wednesday morning, end up somewhere in those nebulous inner states.
-Thursday continue onto Reno.  Meet up with my Mom here for the night.
-Friday hang with my Mom until I go the BA.
-Friday  Night to Sunday Morning be in SF/Daly City.
-Sunday Night - Monday or Tuesday be in Morgan Hill and then return to Santa Ynez/Santa Barbara.  

Hope this helps.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of days ago I was in five states: Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada.

The first three were boring as sin.  I did get to see the sun set as I rounded the Great Salt Lake.  The firmament was especially beautiful.  I ended up in Wendover, NV because I'll be damned if I spend the night in SLC without having to.  Although, to it's credit, SLC is the bastion of civilization in the region despite its proximity to Idaho.  I even saw two hawt gawth chix walking down the street.  And one was a redhead to boot!  There is hope yet.  

So I ended my 1k+ trek for the day on the border, having gone more or less through two whole time zones.  But I tell you that Wendover must also be some sort of backwater.  I stayed at the Nugget Hotel &amp; Casino and it did not have internet!

No Wireless.  No Ethernet.  Nada. Nothing. Zilch. Zero.

Having spent a few days in Iowa with my relatives and a couple of tireless days on the road to get there, I was more than a bit horny when I pulled into Nevada.  In the need for some virtual action, the lack of a jack posed a problem.  So I took the leap of a desperate man: Hotel Porn.

I was presently surprised.  Historically, hotel pornography has long been the domain of thoughtless, vanilla, softcore fare.  Old pornstars and directors fear the day when they are relegated to this uninteresting fate. 

While still very tame as compared to the teeming mass of specialty fetish site you can find online, there was a good amount of variety and most of it was hardcore (not just women massaging their own breasts).   They even had some porn directed to straight women, and some other specifically made for lesbians.  Unfortunately, the closest thing to gay male porn they got was the bisexual stuff [mmf] (gotta be a pussy *somewhere* on screen).  

You may now be asking yourself why I am telling you about my all too expensive "me" time.  Well, because I found out the name for one of my fetishes!  For a long time I had been thinking of it in terms of only length, and that is why I was calling it "my short-hair fetish".  It turns out this goes by, at least in Wendover, the term "Tomboy".  

Loving lesbians and butch bisexuals is more or less a losing bargain.  So on a tactical level it is advantageous to try to be attracted to the people that might have more than an inkling of mutual feelings.  But try as I might, I just can't bring myself to think of the traditional straight woman visage as fundamentally sexy (and not just because it is "too normal", you jerks).  

Having found the correct terminology, I am certain my future internet queries will be more bountiful in results.  Now if I could find the tomboy into suspension......]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey All! So the San Fransisco Silent Film Festival was this last weekend.  I saw three films this time and this is more or less what I thought of them.

1) "The Man Who Laughs": This film was the direct inspiration for the Joker villain in the Batman comics.  My least favorite of the festival, it was also the headliner.  The film had a strong narrative and plot but almost no point o moral.  It is based off of  Victor Hugo novel and features a love quadrangle between two carnies (one blind girl and one man disfigured to that it always looks like he is laughing) and two nobles (a duchess and a prince).  I more or less waited around for all of these four to die and then NONE OF THEM HAD THE COURTESY TO!  Three side characters did, but really only the one in the iron maiden was satisfying.  The film had some really excellent shot angles and fades.  More or less I appreciated the technical aspects but the gimmick the misunderstood laughing man was over pretty quickly.

2) "Her Wild Oat":  It is official: I am in love with Colleen Moore.  This film was far and wide my favorite.  As was pointed out, the plot was your standard Romantic Comedy Formula.  Poor, normal working girl (Ms. Moore) falls for rich wall street man who was dressed as a day laborer.  Hilarity ensues as they court each other in high and low society.  However, as was also noted, because of the films age, this tired old format seemed somehow fresher and more genuine.  Of course there were comedic differences you have a hard time getting through nowadays.  For instance, there was a ton of slapstick as compared to modern films.  Moreover, the inter-titles had a group of hilarious puns, eg

"She is a cabaret dancer at the Owl Club.  One of those 'Iowa' gals.  As in, 'Iowa months rent, Daddy...'"

In retrospect though, the films was eerily similar to "Wall-E".  The male/female gender roles were switched, but the basic plot and humor styles were the same.  Perhaps, true art *does* transcend time.  But something that really does speak through the ages is the mega-hottness of Colleen Moore.  If only she hadn't died when I was three and a half....

3) "Jujiro":  This is a rather famous Japanese silent film by the same director of "A Page of Madness".  Plot revolves around a very strong female character and her no good brother who keeps getting himself into trouble after he fell in love with a prostitute.  It combined traditional Japanese themes (honor, rain, death) with some pretty intense surrealism.  My favorite shot in the film is very very similar to one of my favorite shots in Dziga Vertov's "Man with a Movie Camera".  Here there was a woman's (the prostitute) laughing head imposed over a spinning pinwheel.  A year later Vertov imposed a spinning industrial sewing machine over the head of a laughing peasant woman.  Either way it is creepy and enticing.  On the surface, combing strong Japanese tropes with surrealism reminds modern viewers of "Tetsuo: the Iron Man."   This might be a slightly unfair comparison, but they are alike in awesomeness.  "Jujiro" had a strong narrative structure more similar to Kurosawa than the wacky "Akira"-inspired film.

In summary, nothing was quite as good as the "Godless Girl" from last year.  But "Her Wild Oat" was certainly as good or better than "Girl with a Hat Box" from the year before.  Moreover, I am "inspired" to go out and watch more Colleen Moore films.

As a corollary, the more I go the more I am convinced that the format of the silent film festival is something that would be perfect for Austin.  Both culturally and socially, someone should start this.  Hmmm.....]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have made it back to the Beautiful, Yet Dumb, Santa Ynez Valley.

Things are a bit hectic since my mom did pick up Fraggle at the Reno Shelter.  The new dog is super hyper even at a year old.  Also, only my mother and I seem to think adopting Fraggle was a reasonable idea.  Everyone else is disproving.  But they more or less were against Jo Jo, too. 

So last night and this morning were spent building a 10'x10'x6' Dog Kennel/Run so my mom can at least theoretically get away from this mutt from time to time.  

It feels to be good to be back "home".  Hangin' out with my brothers doing real house work.  We then ran to the YMCA and worked out and played basketball this afternoon.  

Aside from seeing family, the highlight of my return is that I got the next three Gundum discs from Netflix.  Char is still awesome!  Looking forward to the birthdays in LA this weekend.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I believe I have come to the point in my life where my strategy has started to fail.  <br /><br />I have compartmentalized all of my friends and relations to the point where no one is <b>allowed</b> to know the whole story. Well, maybe there is one person who has full disclosure, but he is between a Rock- and a Rose-place.&nbsp; <br /><br />This weekend seemed to exemplify my shortcomings:<br />-I don't look like the fittest guy in the room.<br />-I can't hip-hop/club dance well.<br />-At some point I became the straight man rather than the funny man.<br />-My name is not T-Scop.&nbsp; <br /><br />There were two halves of my brain that I could feel very strongly.&nbsp; They could not talk to each other.&nbsp; Knowing the best way doesn't mean you are not content in discomfort.<br /><br />I walk the walls of my defense network, though I tire of this duty.&nbsp; <br /><br />Don't take this post as overly emotional.&nbsp; Rather I am deeply conflicted over my next few moves. And the inaction quagmire is the wrong action.&nbsp;]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So to all you Ryans out there in the world, Damn You!

I love you guys so much, but there is just no way I will ever be as funny as you.  You are the people that I feel so much less funny around because you are just that hilarious.  All I can do is set up jokes for you.  I am glad to do this because you keep me in stitches the WHOLE time I am around you.  It is such a wonderful feeling to be in the everlasting presence of your one-liners.  I understand that it is half about timing and half what you actually say, but that kind of comedic talent is not present in all of us.  For what it is worth, I would sleep with you for your puns.  

And if you haven't realized it by now Ryan, you don't need to be named Ryan.  You *could* be called Malcolm X, or Jessica Simpson.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>DISCLAIMER: Because I have been sort of busy recently, I now have a backlog of three (3) posts that need to be made.  Expect them to appear in quick succession.</b><br /><br />Every weekend just seems to get a bit crazier.  This one was certainly more action packed than last weekend.  This is saying a lot since it has been historically difficult to top Meenon's parties.  <br /><br />Here goes a summary of my amazing time!<br />1) I got up to Three Rivers (3R) on friday night at about 7 pm.  Went out for dinner and by the time  got back Carly and Andrew 3 had arrived.  <br />2) We waited around for hours and Andrew 1, Caitlin, Garret and Shannon finally showed up at 3 am!<br />3) The next morning I wake up at 10 and everyone else at about noon.  We mobilize and get to the park.<br />4) Road construction in Sequoia has been blessfully ceased, so the ride up was easy.  Listened to The Protomen on the drive up to Giant Forest.<br />5) Did the Bear Hill trail from the museum over to Moro Rock.  Then we went on the Sugar Pine trail from Moro Rock to Crescent Meadow.  I had never done the second one.  That's Amazing!  Endearing, really.<br />6) Drove down the mountain.  A couple of hours later Shanon and Caitlin and I went out to pick up some pizza.<br />7) Tada! Josh and Rachel showed up!  Totally unexpected to me.  It was SOOO(O)^\infty good to see them again.  I am very glad they could make it. (unfortunate that Mowi was feeling sick though).<br />8) After dinner, the LARP started.  I played Caith, and it was AMAZING.  I built Caith as a non-com, so the suckage that occurred in D&amp;D was inversely proportional to the rockage in an RP dinner party setting.<br />9) In game and out, a good number of us got drunk on Absinthe.  Eventually, *someone* ::winkwink:: started doing straight shots and I was obliged to follow.  My description of the rest of the evening will have to be left to your imaginations.<br />10) Recovering and detoxifying, people lazily got up and packed the next morning.  <br />11) Rachel and Josh left.  <br />12) The rest of us then went to Reimers (locally made candy and ice cream shop).  Then everyone left for home.  <br />13) I only made it to Visalia.  I was supposed to go to Sean's that day but it was already like 6 pm, so I decided to call.  He didn't answer.<br />14) Ate and went back to 3R for the night.<br />15) The next day I call couldn't get a hold of Sean, so I resign myself to going back to the Beautiful, Yet Dumb, Santa Ynez Vally.  <br />16) Within 5 minutes of being home, Christen calls.  Within an hour, Sean does.  <br /><br />So in summary I had a great time.  It was wonderful to be able to hike around and RP with people I like &amp; love.  In fact, everyone that went I ended up feeling like I love and respect more than before.  And everyone who didn't go, I already love &amp; respect ~_~.<br /><br />Thus Sincerely, Fuck You 21st Birthday Party!~!]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So in the event that you have been living under a Pop Music rock this summer, the big hit right now is Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl (and I Liked It)".  

Every summer, there is one pop song that both tops the charts and I find guiltily irresistible.  Last year it was Rhianna's "Umbrella"; two years ago it was Gnarls Barkley's "Crazy".  This year it is definitely "I Kissed a Girl".

This song is especially interesting since it really throws the gender-bending norms right in ones face.  On the surface, the lyrics are about a young, straight-defined woman who is experimenting with other women.  Given that women's sexuality seems to be more fluid than men and that girl on girl kissing is rather commonplace, the song doesn't really seem to be breaking any huge molds here.  However, Ms. Perry makes her sexuality a bit more explicit with lines like "I don't even know your name/It doesn't matter."  Indicating that her homo-desires are raw and explicit.  

However, the lyrics are only one side of the gender-bending of this song.  The actual orchestration I can only describe as a confusion of Pop/Techno and traditional Hair Metal.  The latter is particularly interesting since this was primarily the domain of men of the stroke-my-enormous-cock-OMG-I-am-a-rock-star variety.  Otherwise, the song is well within the "Look at me I am breaking boundaries" domain. This type typically bores me since the boundaries (which is true here) have been broken since the dawn of girls mackin' with other chix. 

However via <a href="void(0);/*1217397454397*/">Coverville</a>, I found out about <a href="void(0);/*1217397517764*/">Max Vernon's</a> amazing cover!

You might be tempted to then say, "Haha, knock-up job mate!  Now everything is all heteronormative now again!"  But I assure you that this is about as far from the truth as can be.  

Max changes almost none of the words. Thus the lines that go "I kissed a girl/Hope my boyfriend don't mind it" take on a even more distinctly homosexual twist.  With Katy Perry's version, there is a girl having a first lesbian encounter, where as with Max there is a boy having his first straight encounter.  

Furthermore, Max also changes the instrumentation significantly.  Where Katy was using male-oriented methods to really drive her gender play home, Mr. Vernon does the same thing.  Max's take on the song make you think it is a piano solo for the first have.  When more players come in, they are much lower in intensity than the original.  One might even describe his version as the more feminine.

In summary, both songs are sexy and amazing.  I strongly encourage a sampling.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let me start off this post by making it very clear that I do love the land of my birth and some parts of California are among the most beautiful I have ever seen.  That being said, Flame On!

Having driven all around this country I have noticed an interesting trend about personal/external aesthetics.  It seems that the uglier the place is, the more the general populous living there cares about personal appearance.  Conversely, the more gorgeous a local is perceived to intrinsically be, the less the residents take care of their body.  Naturally this is broad and may have some anomalous bumps.

Although Southern and Northern California may have at time had some natural beauty, the Bay Area and LA have been paved and scarred for generations now.  Nature has been more absconded here than in almost any other location in the country (NYC maybe worse, I have never been).  In other words the populated parts of California rank among my least favorite places to exist in.  These parts of the west coast are disgusting and overgrown.  

Why then are they also home to per capita the hottest, sexiest, fittest people in the country.  Additionally, the degrees of these variables are much more varied than from Arizona to Florida.

It can't be that *all* of the beautiful people somehow flock to the coasts once they are of age.  Many of the people I know or have met that I put a cut above the standard populous were born here or have lived in California since they were small children.  

This is why I am lead to think that is something more subtle and insidious.  I am going to go out on a limb and suggest that people who grow up in such a man-made environment internalize this non-nature.  Since beauty is not being provided to them in their everyday, aestheticism is taught to be built up from the inside.

The easiest thing to alter is outward appearance.  Hence, beauty is not obtained by going for a hike or by appreciating birds.  Beauty is found by making oneself beautiful.  Everyone wins, right?

Well, not if you want it all ^_~]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[for i in range(5):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print i, "--", thoughts()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print<br /><br />0 -- Last Saturday I was up in Three Rivers (3R) with everyone.  That morning I needed some supplies so I went out to Village Market.  I needed some Pop Tarts for breakfast.  They also amazingly had butterscotch schnapps, so I picked some up. (I knew people had brought Baileys and/or Emmets; Buttery Nipples were "emme"-nant.) Then, my stomach was feeling bad so I got some Mylanta.  Right above the Mylanta were the condoms.  Thinking it would be funny I picked these up too.  Hence, I walked up to the counter laid down my Pop Tarts, my booze, my Mylanta, and my condoms, shrugged, smiled, and said "It is just one of those days ^_~."<br /> <br />1 -- So I have had these weird growths on my hands for a while now.  I self-diagnosed them as common warts.  But I tried freezing them off multiple times.  When this didn't work, I thought they weren't.  Thus I went to the dermatologist the other day. <u><i><b> She gave me a yeast infection.</b></i></u>  No joke!  She actually injected the aforementioned areas with yeast infection protein.   It turns out they are warts.  The yeast infection protein tricks your body into attacking the area.  While there, your immune system finds the warts and then tries to destroy them too.  Very sneaky.   <u><i><b> She gave me a yeast infection Three (3) TIMES!</b></i></u><br /><br />2 -- I am watching this TV series that I am renting the discs from Netflix.  I finished disc 5 and because of some haranguing I had all of my discs in at once.   But for whatever reason, they decided to send me disc 6 from Butte, MO.  However, they sent me discs 7 &amp; 8 from like 60 miles away.  Now they all left the same day which means I am sitting here debating whether to skip a disc or not.  But this all begs the question, "WHY DOES NETFLIX HAVE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN BUTTE, MO?"  Nothing is close to Butte but Butte.  This can't be economical....<br /><br />3 -- It was Sicily, 1922: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/22/estelle.getty.obit/index.html">Estelle Getty died</a>.  Good Night, Sweet Prince(ss?)<br /><br />4 -- I like getting in discussions on LJ.&nbsp; Some people named Kerry are feeling compelled to comment and are =).&nbsp; Some people named Kerry are feeling compelled to comment and aren't =(.&nbsp; Some people named Kari aren't even reading =\.&nbsp; In conclusion, teletubbies.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey Everybody!<br /><br /><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/3R3BBackpacking2008">Just got back from the annual three Scopatz brother's backpacking trip in Sequoia National park.</a> This year we did the Twin Lakes Trail. I decided on this trail because last year we did the Alta and Lakes Trails. These other two go up the one side of Tokopah Valley and the Twin Lakes Trail goes up the other.<br /><br />This trail was intense! It was seven miles of a relentless uphill climb (~2500 ft). The Alta Trail and the Twin Lakes Trail have point where after a good rise, you walk downhill for a bit. Oh ho, not so here! All up all the time.<br /><br />The lakes themselves were pretty; but we had to cut our planned 4 day/3 night excursion one day and night short due to concerns over rain and a lack of proper gear to handle it.<br /><br />The first day was spent getting up to the Twin Lakes. The second day we took day hike to Lost Lake in Sequoia National Forest, because now unlike its moniker we have found it. Lost Lake was 5 miles away and required a thousand foot climb to Silliman Pass and then a 2000 foot decent into the valley on the other side. Of course this was reversed on the return trip.<br /><br />The third day was supposed to be a grueling 20 mile long loop. However, the day before while coming back home over the Silliman gap we saw and heard and felt a thunderstorm. Luckily, this stayed on *that* side of the ridge and didn't rain on us that night. A group that came back over a couple hours later actually got fully caught in the storm on their way out. A ranger told us that there was a 30% rain chance for the next day. Furthermore, by the morning of the third day, the winds had shifted. What was a warm front (being in the 70s at night at 9500 ft) had turned into a a very cold air mass. Taking this as a sign of trouble to come, we cut our losses and, better safe than sorry, headed down the mountain.<br /><br />It was disappointing that we had to call the trip early, but Shane's and Julian's rain gear consisted of one black plastic bag each. Oh well, we will know for next year to get some serious rain gear for everyone in the party.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I am looking forward to next year! It is looking increasingly likely that we will end up in Mineral King. Should be fun!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Coming to visit the Valley is always so informative.  

I have long known that my social engineering (SE) skills were honed and sharpened here.  However, it may turn out that this is precisely the place where I attended "ninja training camp", as it were.

What I noticed this trip is that nigh on everyone in this friend group engages in it, and they more or less acknowledge it.  Furthermore, they all approach it with the mindset (that I do, that I likely learned from them) that it <b>is not</b> interpersonal manipulation, but rather a survival mechanism.  This is simply how the "game" is played, so one may as well play it.  It is how these people communicate with each other.

Ok wonderful.  There is this subculture that is stable and functions in this way with most of its members.  Yet there seem to be a couple of salient features that I just noticed that should be discussed.

1) When you remove people who think and act like this from this subculture and put them in a group of people that doesn't communicate like this, then fun times happen.  First off, the social engineer doesn't change what their actions.  However, they do feel compelled to not be so explicit in what is going on in their brain, since the new group of people is likely predisposed against this. 

However, this doesn't stop the SE from behaving as such.  Thus our hero will more or less be able to construct the social situations they desire, because no one is expecting them to do so.  Of course there will be one or two people in the new group who think along the same lines, but they likely haven't had the practice honing their skill since they weren't living in a pure SE environment.

2) Secondly, when living in a pure SE environment everyone develops not only the external communication and information gathering tools, but also a deep set of inner personal skills. This is to say that even though they can mine the minds of others with some competence, they also by necessity develop a hardy bulwark of defenses.  These evasive maneuvers themselves may become a separate skill set that can be perfected.

Hence, when someone has a better defensive block to you than you have data mining abilities on them, they effectively become an enigma to you.  Their emotional state is hard to read. Predictions about what they will do in a given situation all come out a wash.

From personal experience, I have found that just because you have information does not mean you can perform any positive acts with it.  I am sure that it is partially because of this that I feel that the Enigma people from above are super hawt.

Not only do they have the "tough nut to crack" thing going, but that lack of information might be occasionally beneficial.  Moreover, it is not that there is no communication occurring, as with most dysfunctional relationships with a lack of info situation.  Both the Enigma and me keep mining each other.  It is simply that discovery of true feelings can be stalled during those notoriously bad wishy-washy moments.

So aside from other things physical and mental, girls who are Enigmas definitely get super-marks in my book.  Love ya all.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Enigma girls are still tricky, but not wholly in the way I thought.  I guess I didn't realize true emotional/mental/spiritual effort that goes into them.

I had approached them originally like a coin.  You don't <i>a priori</i> know how they are going to respond, so you may a well flip and be done with it.

However, this only really representative of the situation on the ground before the toss.  It turns out Enigma girls are more like event/probability trees, like a sport's division playoff roster.  There are a bunch of options, contingencies and paths.

Furthermore, there are a million pathways to "No".  A relatively few number that are successful.  And still a small number that manage to maintain (more or less) the status quo.  

Even playing a perfect game does not guarantee a "Yes". Other players could have closed these paths down long ago.  

So what then are these Enigma girls?  They are coins whose one face is a flat negative and whose positive side is a tree.  But the forest is dark and finding the right set of branches could leave you hanging for a couple of years, waiting for new growth.  

Am I content to hang? Yes, though I might braciate elsewhere.  Like to Texas.  
Am I sad? No, even though the it was understood that this contingency was the most likely, it is still disappointing hear it.  However, I am a bit proud that I made it this far.  Lesser men and women have fallen ^_^. 

You enigma girls are truly my betters. Friends until the end.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I have spent the time since my last post traveling around and seeing peoples.

Last night, Meenon and Jessica Simpson (still hilarious) had some good things to say about Enigmas to me.  Without getting into it, balance of interest and honesty at the early stages of a non-relationship is something that they have a unique perspective on (among my friends).

This morning+, Meenon and I went lingerie shopping (for her, not me though I did see some fun stuff).  We in fact went to Fredrick's of Hollywood <i><b>in Hollywood!</b></i>  It was fun and helped with a costume idea about gloves.  We had pizza for lunch.  

Perhaps most importantly we went to this fairly famous (though the name escapes me) film bookstore in Hollywood.  They also happen to have a bunch of movie stills and posters.  Unfortunately, they did not have a poster of "Her Wild Oat".  However, they did have a bunch of Coleen Moore stills.  I ended up buying five (5) of them ^_^.

After that I drove down to San Diego in the afternoon. I met up with Kerry Deuce for dinner and then we hung out for a few hours.   It was a good time.  Now I am here in the hotel in SD with my family.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whew!  This one was a deeewwsy!  

So this last trip was super intense.  I will try to separate the cream from the other butter here.

<b>Timeline:</b>  
1) After the seeing peeps in LA (Meenon, Jessica Simpson, and other enigmatic folk) I went to San Diego (SD) for the big summer family vacation. 
2) First day I went to the optical engineering conference SPIE with my dad.
3) The next day I went to Tijuana with the family.
4) The third day, we left SD and went to Ramona to visit my Great Uncle Kurt.  Ended up in Escondido that evening.
5) Sunday we went to the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
6) Last day Monday, we went to the Original Pancake House in Vista and then the Atlantian-themed Fry's.

<b>Cream:</b>
1) Before actually meeting up with my family, I went to visit Kerry Deuce.  It has been a while since I have seen her and we hung out and exchanged stories for a few hours.  Turns out that my Kerry collection will soon all be living in the City.  Makes it more convenient for future visits ^_^.  Made it through with zero (0) references to Dune. Awesome.
2) The Wild animal park was amazing!  You really should go.
3) Going to the SPIE conference with my dad reminded me of all of my ole Physics days.  Moreover, it got me thinking about laser isotope enrichment.
4)It was sooooo good to see my great uncle again.  This subject gets a little political depending on who you talk to.  We will suffice it to say he is the last living Holocaust survivor in the family.
5) Watched some Olympics.  More or less we pwn basketball on both mens &amp; womens.  And Jamaicans are short distance Kenyans ^_^.
6) Birthday, duh!

<b>Butter</b>
1) While we were in SD proper, all 6 of us were crammed into this *maybe* 500 sqft hotel room.  It was bad.
2) One of my brothers was just awful this trip.  He was complaining and morose the whoooooole time.  He didn't want to come so much that he bothered my parents until they gave in.  For various reasons he came anyway.
3) However, he failed to behave on the trip.  This made my mom incredibly jumpy.  This lead to my father and I and eventually my other brother getting in immense amount of trouble over the smallest little thing.
4) For instance, I got in trouble for saying "Mornin'" as a response to "Good Morning" to my mom.  Since I left out the word good I clearly didn't care about her feelings, the family, etc.
5) My mother forced us to cut the trip short, which is when we left SD.  However, people kind of made up and we ended up staying an extra day.
6) During all of this, I backed into a parked car when pulling out of a parking space.
7) On the last day, it came out that said brother had brought a switchblade.  At least he "wasn't planning on hurting anyone else" on the trip.

So don't take my word for it, try it for yourself!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This summer has had it's ups and downs.  Bit by bit, I move along.  But I have learned at least one thing.

My option-space for partners is a lot larger in California than it is in Texas.  I am not quite sure why this is, but I do know how I feel about it. Somewhat disappointed.  This is one of those very few things that I am more or less upset that I live in Texas.  I wanna have my pie and eat it too.  While it is nice to know that you *could* have a date, consistently being told no because of 1500+ miles is a little frustrating.  Granted it has been a while since I have even wanted to play the field.  Now that I am again, I have been as successful as I could reasonably achieve. 

So what is the deal with Tejas?  

Well near as I can tell there are a few things.  The first is that I lost a lot of weight while I have been out in Austin.  This means the out in California, people compare me to their memory of me.  So I am competing with myself and doing really well!  However, in Texas and among people I have not previously known I am still competing with the rest of the world in terms of appearance.  Tough break.

Next, the community (or communities) in California allow for the rekindling of old flames and the introduction to a variety of new people.  Of course, this plays off a lifelong history of generating and keeping friends in a collection of places.  Not only by myself, but also by my friends.  I have only been in Texas a couple of years AND the community doesn't really support this behaviour.

Lastly and obviously, there is school.  While in Texas I am quite focused on my studies.  And I tend to be rather worked and tried a good portion of the time.  Then all of my big blocks of free time I spend out of state.  More or less then very little of my socializing is spent in Austin trying to play the local field.  I am just too busy and otherwise occupied.

I think I have solutions to all of these points.  But that is another post. If you take nothing else from this, understand that I am now back in business.  The closed sign has been flipped to open.   Renovations are mostly complete.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whew!  Made it back to Austin...Finally!  The last leg of this trip was really rough.

If going back to California is like putting on an old shoe, than coming back to Texas is like putting on an old boot.  Considerably more difficult but nostalgic and worth it all the same.  Time to start my own life again, right?  Like totally, Y'all! 

So onto my own life....

I have my qualifying exams on Monday.  Oops!  Combo break that with all of the unpacking and re-'rangin' I have to do around the house and I more or less will be ignoring everyone until after I take them.  Wish me luck!

It is probably bad that my only compulsions right now are to unpack, ogle my prints of Colleen Moore, and interface with things of Gundam nature, huh?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This update is a little overdue in some senses.  But I needed the time to cool off and put someone's head on my shoulders.

Everyone's life is always a probability tree.  Mine is more so now than it has been since I have moved to Austin.  What follows is a qualitative diagram what *may* happen.  I am neglecting to put numbers down, because frankly it is too woeful to think about.

1) I pass the quals when I retake them in January.
___A) I stay at UT until I get my PhD.

2) I fail the quals in January.
___A) Under the departmental rules I am therefore kicked out of UT and out of a job.
______i) I must find something else to do.  Though my parents have offered to float me for a time, I am unsure if this is responsible on my part
_________a) Get a crap job to make ends meet somewhere around Austin.
_________b) Find a "career"-esque job.  This may or may not take me away from Austin (hopefully NO) and may or may not take me to California (if I have to go somewhere :shrug:) and may or may not be at a national lab (please NO!!!).  
_________c) Study for the LSAT and go to law school.  I still haven't married a lawyer, so law school is still on the table ^_^.
_________d) Go to grad school at UT elsewhere but almost certainly in another field.  I have forsaken Physics (discovered that the emotional block seems to be permanent).  So I would likely switch to comp-sci or comp-engineering or something.  But we shouldn't overlook the possibility that I am simply not cut out to be an academic.  I have had this creeping fear for a while.  

___B) There *might* (so Josh tells me) exist a provision by which students whom have failed the qualifier twice but the professors believe actually know the material are allowed to take the test a third and last time.
______i) GOTO 1.

Seeya in February where ever I am.  If you are reading this and assuming that it isn't that bad and I that I am blowing things out of scale, let me assure you that it is that bad.  Somehow I thought that taking the hard way would be easier.

PS I have beaten Dynasty Warriors: Gundam.  Needless to say, it was amazing....just like Disgaea 3 =).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As it turns out my cousins, predictions about <a href="http://salaris.livejournal.com/2008/07/30/">August</a> were more or less spot on.  But not for the reasons he mentioned.  I am oddly glad that my favourite month is now over.  Yet here we are again at September, my old nemesis.

I really have nothing positive to post.  Things suck at school.  Things suck at work.  Things suck at home.  of course, all of this serves to worsen my stomach (and then I made the mistake of eating <a href="http://www.annies.com/naturalmacandcheese">a box of my comfort food</a>). 

Knowing my penchant for anti-emo posting, you may be asking why I am even writing this.  Well, because I have something to communicate to you.  Yes, you.

I am avoiding everyone right now.  And yes this does include you, my dear.  I have been trying to for the past week or so. I expect that it will last *at least* another week for me to sort out my own business. So don't take it personally.

In explanation of past behaviour Josh was only in town for the week before returning to Idaho.  So I made an exception and did not avoid him too, in order to avoid real and true ass-hood.  Also, I am not avoiding Michael as this is logistically ridiculous.  But, I will try to avoid his guests.  

I hope this clarifies some of my recent behaviour.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am posting now because I am sick of writing.  My paper that is.  I am really just editing now...the annoying part.  I finished the graphic novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">"Watchmen"</a>.

As always, I need to start off with some disclaimers:
1) <b>There will be spoilers.</b>
2) I *really* did enjoy the ride.
3) The back cover calls the work "Peerless".

Overall, I liked it and felt compelled to keep reading.  In that OCD kinda way.  There were some things that they did very very right in this comic. The first of these, which is awesome, is that Rorschach's face changes in each panel.  Secondly, the gimmick of having plain-text portions at the end of each chapter that give in character background information is brilliant.

However, this gimmick actually turns out to be one of my larger criticisms against "Watchmen".  The story involves a decent number of characters from rather distinct backgrounds.  So maybe I have gone soft via <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/">GRRM</a>, but I now expect different characters to have different voices.  This means that the author has to take on a different writing style to accommodate the character that is speaking.  Normally, this isn't a problem with comics because the voices are all flat and you are STARING at the character talking.  But there were really only 5 voices 1) Rorschach, 2) Walter Kovacs, 3) Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, 4) the newspaper man (generic Brooklyn stereotype), 5) and everyone else.

My basic point is that Hollis shouldn't sound Dan Dreiberg who shouldn't sound like Sally Jupiter who shouldn't sound like the Comedian, etc.  This really limited my ability to suspend my disbelief, because it was no longer the characters speaking, but rather the author talking TO me.  I was starting to see this but the real clincher is that plain-text gimmick at the end of every chapter.  The first couple are by Hollis Mason (retired Nite Owl #1) and the third is by Dr. Manhattan.  They are written in the same style. NOOOO.  They comic continually tries to make the case that Dr. Manhattan is now no longer quite human.  He really shouldn't be sharing the same speech patterns with the psychologist.  

The other thing about Dr. Manhattan is that by his own admission there is no reason to be blue.  

I did like that the bad guy won, and that the bad guy was a good guy acting with the best of intentions (even if he stood to make a profit off of it).  I also like that Veidt won over Dr. Manhattan to his evil scheme with LOGIC.  But then Dr. Manhattan admits that even if Rorschach were to make it back to civilization that no one would take him seriously as he is a criminal and monkey-off-of-his-nuts crazy.  However, that Dr. Manhattan then goes and kills Rorschach unceremoniously, out of hand really bothers me.  This does not follow LOGIC.

There were some cute devices like Robert Redford (RR, totally not Ronald Reagan) running for president.  But for everyone of these there was a laborious passage by Dreiberg (or, THE AUTHOR) talking about Art thinly disguised as ornithology.  

Lastly, I am fine with the leveling of New York as a plot device.  But c'mon, did it really need to be Cthulhu?  After all that, we get to some inter-dimensional, squid-monster, Elder-being, unknowable H.P. Lovecraft fan service?

So in summary, Watchmen was cool.  It was fun.  But it certainly wasn't because it was without peer.]]></content:encoded>

Probably will stay this way until after I get back from Switzerland (Sept. 19th-20th?) depending on what is going on.  This is about two weeks longer than expected.  But one of these is the conference; so really you can blame Chocolate, Coo-Coo Clocks, and Secret Bank Accounts.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Once again I find myself painfully bored with editing.

Because there was such a cacophony against what I wrote about "Watchmen" and most of it echoed each other, I have started this thread as a general response.  You know rather than repeating myself ^_^.

Ok So let me clarify again.  I did like it.  I really did.  However, everyone I ever talked to before reading seemed to say that it was a 9 or a 10.  I didn't think so.  I would put it more at a 7 or an 8. And that is all I was trying to get across and gave my reasons why I would place it lower than most people.

<b>1) Publishing date and temporal relativism:</b> Yes, I understand that "Watchmen" came out before Cthulu was 'cool' and 'overused'.  I knew this while reading it, which is why I more or less give it a pass on this front.  I didn't mention this originally so much as a criticism as much as a personal taste thing. 

Only having a 20 year shelf life for me is incredibly short compared to the rest of the works on my bookshelf (off by a couple of orders of magnitude).  Which is why *I* would rate it lower than your normal human being.  Tolkien only had about 50 years.  And who knows GRRM could have even less.  But I am prepared to judge books by future standards when that time comes.

But there are other Sci-Fi/Fantasy works that at this time still seem to be fairly transcendent of time.  Sure Asimov was only expanding on classical themes (Golem, etc).  Okay, Herbert achieved his different voices mostly through insane perturbations of obscure words.  Both of these authors worked before "Watchmen" and retain their presence.

<b>2) Hitting/Missing:</b> Actually, I am pretty sure I didn't miss the point.  I got it <i>and I liked it.</i>  I didn't really talk about the postmodern elements in my original post because I thought that this was one of the larger marks in its favor.  I really wanted that post to be about what I didn't like, and specifically how the voice thing bothered me so much (since this seems unique, and therefore interesting).  

But now that you bring it up, I loved it.  Specifically, the stuff with the privateer comic-in-the-comic stuff was amazing.  Reading those sections provided me with a multitasking challenge that I found difficult at 4 am.  

The fact that the characters are supposed to represent other more well known characters is sort of a given in order for the author to make the points and commentaries he wants to make.

And Blah!  I need to start editing again.  I have a lot of thoughts on modernism, post-modernism, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtWSlAi1uJg">post-post-modernism</a>. But I guess it has got to wait.  

BTW the tag for the original post was an in joke to the people in Austin.  So don't be confused by it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I did this a couple of weeks ago, while avoiding real work.  But since then, I have been too busy with real work to actually post this.  

As a GNU/Linux user and computational scientist, I spend <i>a lot</i> of time looking at computer screens.  So a while ago I decided to do the transparent terminal thing, so I could see my background while I code.  Keep things spicy rather than looking at white-on-black ALL of the time.

Most people (sub-human kernel hackers, really) choose their backgrounds as either softcore porn, or softcore hentai if they are *really* nerdy.  However these pictures tend to be flashy and interfere with you being actually able to read the text.  So these people (see above) have to actually decrease the overall transparency.  

I go with simple, mostly black backgrounds.  And I require that the color scheme in the picture *does not* interfere with the default terminal color scheme (Yeah Gentoo!).

This more or less means that I have to make my own backgrounds since it is impossible to find pre-generated images that satisfy my needs.  I still go with the traditional anime theme, though not quite as slutty. 

My previous background from last year was for GTO.  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/RandomPicturesOfMe#5244462517993079314">My new background is of a new type of hero.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, everybody remembers when Wikipedia was shiny and new right?  You would spend hours getting lost in the flow of the links.  Luckily Michael introduced me to this amazing website: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage">TV Tropes</a>.  Sadly, it is just as addicting.

More or less it goes through about every form of media (including REAL LIFE) and links it to the tropes, cliches, plot devices that the piece at hand utilizes.    So it is more or less amazing.

Be forewarned that is completely written by nerds of the "New Media Studies" variety.  So if you don't get the humor I apologize.  This also means that while they may have listed every anime known to man, they have probably left out your favorite silent film.  In any event, it is hilarious!

But with such a proliferation of tropes, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">including ones that are older than dirt</a>, one has to wonder if it is even possible to come up with something new and original.  Everything you touch will be cataloged and made fun of on this website.

That being said, here are a few of my favorite pages:
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">Get A Hold of Yourself Man (Brightslap!)</a>
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByPragmatism">Death By Pragmatism</a>
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyParticle">Minovsky Particle</a>

<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">Grows the Beard</a>
...and of course, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceJews">Space Jews</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have successfully made it to Switzerland and to the congress.  The trip out here was naturally not without its hiccups.  I was about as depressed as ever when I first got here.  Here are the reasons for it that I can tell,

1) The travel over here had us arrive in town before noon local time.  I then had to stay up until around 8 pm to get onto a normal schedule.  The 40+ hours of being awake does things to a man.
2) No Gundam access for a <i>whole</i> week!  Just the thought has had me in pangs.  You know you are an addict when...
3) Not to diminish what is going on back home in Texas, but the weather here has been awful.  We got here on the first day of snow for this season.  Another data point proving I might have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder">SAD</a>.
4) The ethnic homogeneity of Switzerland.
5) Short hair on women.
6) My eyes are blue.

You may have noticed that Disgaea was not on the above list.  This is because I have been fervently playing my PSP copy, which has sustained me through many afternoons of darkness.

Otherwise, the above reasons combine in interesting ways.  Firstly, being extremely tired and stressed out triggered my ever-present stomach problems with always leaves me emotionally battered.  Then on the train from Zurich to Interlaken, I started thinking...which is always a bad idea.

I noticed that on trains we were passing that the we were passing that the 90+%  of the people fit into one of the four ethnic Swiss groups, which are all more or less white.  Up to this point and afterward, whenever Erich and I would go anywhere we would try to speak in German.  With Dr. Schneider, whose Deutsch is better than mine, others would reply in German.   Even though I always started in German, they never failed to reply in English.  

This got me thinking.  Both  of our families left the old country at about the same time.  But Erich still looks Ethnically German (and thus ethnically Swiss for the part of Switzerland we are in).  I do not.  I no longer look like a native in part because my people were wiped out of this region 60 years ago.  Sure the Swiss weren't part of the Nazi regime, but they were just a smidge more than complacent in it.  I don't know if other people have ever had this experience, but I felt very uneasy for a while after I arrived.  Not in a personal safety kind of way, but I felt this overwhelming rejection of just everything.  I was ashamed I had ever even tried to learn German.

Shake and bake this with Gundam and you get more reasons why Char is my hero.  Would you have joined the Axis military force in order to get close to Hitler and kill him?  Probably.  

On another note, short hair on women is still classy in Europe.  None of them are making any kind of statement and they can't *all* be dykes.  Of die Frauen at the conference, I have only seen one woman with hair below shoulder length.  Only 40% have hair at or near shoulder length and all the rest are even closer trimmed.  Normally, one would think that this would please me.  Instead it made me question why I wasn't living here (see above) and the ghola ratio is too high.  Not that I wouldn't tap 25% of them in a second.  But I haven't.  Yet.

All of this has gotten me shook up enough for my eyes to have transmigrated to blue.  And for them to stay there.  I tried to take a picture, but shining a light in my eyes threw off the color balance and they ended up looking green-gray in the picture anyways.

High Holy Days are coming up.  And you know what that means.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Eyes have shifted back to green.  Must be getting used to the place.

I have been waking up at three in the morning and going to bed between 6 and 8 pm.  This doesn't even vaugely match a Texan schedule and is an old persons day over here.  So far, what I can stay awake through of the confrence is good.  My paper is later today and hopefully people won't ream it too badly.  It has been a tough crowd so far (which is why I am not giving the talk). 

It is still cold here.  No longer zero it has at least hit double digits (though most of the day is spent around 6).  Yesterday it got warm enough for me to take off my jacket in direct sunlight.  Also, the clouds managed to clear for the lunch hour (afterwhich it was more overcast again).  But I got some pictures while I had the chance.

I also took a long walk yesterday around the outskirts of town.  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Interlaken#">Really super pretty</a>.  It actually reminds me a lot of Sequoia and other high alpine parts of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.  The landscape is mostly (unfortunately newgrowth) conifer forest with patchwork meadows throughout.  Suprisigly to me, much of the geology is very similiar as well.  Many of the main structures are of granite/marble laced with quartz seams.  That which isn't, is made up of grey slate and shale.  Sure the relative concentrations are a bit off as compared to my homeland, but it is quite astonding to see the same sort of diversity above and below ground.

This, as you would expect, bit me in the ass on the first day I was here.  I found a plant that looked like mint.  So I decided to crinkle one of the leaves so I could smell it.  Needless to say it was not mint <i>at all</i>.  Whatever was on the underside of that leaf was prickly as hell.  The micro-thorns ended up shaving of the first layer or two of skin on my thumb.  <b>And it didn't even smell like anything!</b>  That'll teach me.

I think I forgot to mention that the internet connections suck here.  About $5 for a thirty minute connection and the free wireless at the confrence is disgustingly unreliable.  You'd think that with 12 routers you would be able to find one that works.  But even if you get one with a good signal stregth, 70% of the time it won't give you an IP address.  (I think it has something to do with dedicating MAC addresses to an ip, which is fucked up at a confrence of this size.)

However, the town still has pre-Great War water fountains and a Japaneese tea garden put in by its sister city Osua.  Such are the benefits of assumed neutrality.  Screw the Euro!

If I was smart I would have converted all of my liquid assests to CHF before coming over and then back to USD when I go back.  Could have made an easy 5% doing nothing this week.  RIP Lehman, AIG.  And stay dead this time will ya?!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last day at the congress and it seems to have gone well.  I had a good time at least.  <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Interlaken#">I have added some more pictures of my hotel room here in Interlaken</a>.

And now Erich and I start our long trip home.  Because the our flight leaves at 10 am from Zurich, and the train from Interlaken to Zurich takes a few hours, we have to be in Zurich tonight.  So I will get to do some sightseeing around the city as our hotel is downtown. Then we wake up and get on a plane.  Assuming that there are no delays, I will be arriving back in Austin on Friday afternoon.  Though my computer tells me it is now 2 am CST on Thursday,  this means I will be coming back tomorrow...but really it seems like three days from now to me.

Yesterday, Erich gave the talk on my work.  I think it went very well.  His was the best talk (ie got the most number of interested, non-super-critical questions) of the session, which was my favorite session of the congress (Nuclear Power and Sustainable Development).  NOTE: the only talks that had real economists at the conference were the first two of this session.

But the real gem came that evening.  I was having dinner (Fondue &amp; Epessess) with Erich and an economist professor (Erich's friend) from Stanford.  From what I gathered he has somewhat recently gone through a less-than-pretty divorce.  In any event, he said that he joined eHarmony.com for the hell of it (aka lulz), confidence building, etc.  Nothing serious.

The plot thickens, much like the fondue.  Then he comes out and says it.  With one of his friends back home, he set up a fake female account on eHarmory to see if he could get matched with himself.  And he finds it funny to read the guys trying to proposition "her".  Yup.  <a href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/2008/04/13/">Sound like a pair of Walkers, perhaps?</a>  

This being a group of scientists/engineers/economist, I got to watch my adviser sit there and laugh at the idea and watch the two of them try to pick apart the social networking scene.  All in hilarious seriousness, just like our age group does!  It took every once of will not to 1) laugh my ass off, and 2) talk about my OKC experiences.  Does my adviser *really* need to know that I have a gay male cowboy alter-ego online? If he is smart enough to read my blog he already does.  

However, I think I am safe since I had to explain to him last night that MySpace is a sleazy den of pedophiles and whereas FaceBook is a necessary evil.

I think that is about it for now.  Not sure when I will have internet again.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll try to keep this short and snappy, but I have the feeling it will run away on me.

After my last update I headed to Zurich and did a walking tour of the town.  The points of interest are as follows:
<b>1) Grossmuenster Church:</b> This was the church that the eminent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwingli">Zwingli</a> presided in.  If I had to pick a Christian hero, tops would certainly be Joan of Arc.  But a *very* close second would be Zwingli.  His teachings were very much in Jewish Rationalist tradition (eg Rambam, Spinoza), if not intentionally.  Also, rad statue of Charlemagne (likely my 3rd Christian hero) in the crypts.
<b>2) Fraumuenster Church:</b>  Former abbey that has a a ton of beautiful stained class windows done by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Chagall">Marc Chagall</a>.  You know, the nice Jewish painter...
<b>3) Zurich Synagogue:</b>  I found it, but it was locked and I couldn't go inside.  Looked to be more of a Sephardic construction, which interested me.  Also, the iron work on the outside was a repeating pattern of pentagons-inscribed-within-pentagrams.  Where's the Mogen David, WTF?  Kissed the mezuzah and left.
<b>4) Rietberg Museum:</b>  Zurich has 50 odd museums so I had to be a little choosy.  So I went for the one that was only a moderate hike though a park (I kid you not) called the Arboretum.  The museum featured mostly Ancient Asian works, with a smattering of works by indigenous populations of Africa, Pacific Islanders, and the Americas (including Inuits!).  They had a really good selection of Japanese wood cut prints, which is something I am very into. I love the idea of inventing a method for cheap, mass-produced artwork and then immediately using it for porn.  The best quote off of one of these was "<i>Going home or living abroad are the same thing</i>". However, their rotating section was even cooler.  It was an illustrated (using old paintings from the 16-1700s) walk-through of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayana</a>.  This of course being one of the oft-overlooked highly influential pieces of ancient mythology. One of the better museum exhibits I have ever seen.

In summary, I may have been a bit harsh on Switzerland before.  It just took me a few days to adjust.  The real proof to this was that my last night there was of course the night that I started dreaming in German again. (Not that my dreams weren't still nightmares, but eh, you can't win em all.) 

Zurich is a really neat.  I would totally go back. I am even toying with the idea of applying to <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/">CERN</a> or <a href="http://www.psi.ch/index_e.shtml">PSI</a> post-grad-school, assuming I pass my quals.  You know, get out of the country for a while and as an alternative to Los Alamos or some Academic thing here. There are a number of Asian institutes that are very good as well, but I can at least pretend to know the language in Switzerland. Also, they have the benefit of not being in the EU, which I can talk more about later.  

And on one final note: whoever moved my table and couch while I was away, please refrain from *ever* doing this again.  I know it was only by a couple of inches.  However, I navigate around my place with the lights off at night.  I rely heavily on my mental map to do this, so...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am trying to stay awake for another hour or so, so I thought I would post this.  Basically I am calling the November US Presidential election for the McCain/Palin ticket.  We can place bets later, but here are my reasons.

The Japanese are finally getting around to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST6602920080922">breaking up their one-party system</a>.  However, this is always hard to do in a parliamentary system where last ditch efforts to form a coalition government are typically successful.

However, out of Israel last week <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aEVOwGS6w8Og">we have similar news</a>.  Now, I have never really been a fan of the Kadima party, but to their credit they are far more moderate than many of the minor Israeli parties.

Even still, I can get behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzipi_Livni">Tzipi Livni</a>.  I think she is much more pragmatic and moderate than Sharon and Olmert were (at least where it counts [the Palestinian situation]).    

Now here is the clincher: if she can form a coalition government she becomes the next Prime Minister.  (In the West there is a lot of talk about her being the "Second Female Israeli PM", as if this somehow matters, since the Democrats failed to elect Hilary Clinton.  Really I don't think this matters one bit, and really isn't a novelty in a way.  Don't be fooled by the media in any way.  The *only* way it could matter is if the Arab world doesn't see her as being <i>immediately</i> hostile on issues like the Palestinians and Lebanon, like they were with her two predecessors [rightly so, as it turns out].)  However, the timeline of events works out such that Livni will either be the new Prime Minister a couple of weeks before the November election -OR- Israel also has to go to a general election. 

Right now, it looks fairly likely that Livni will be able to pull out some sort of government.  And this is my central point.  Life isn't good enough to me for both Obama *and* Livni to succeed, so McCain will probably win.  Mark my words.

This is actually a safe bet for me either way if you think about it.  So who is up for it?  I got $5+ on Livni forming a coalition government by the November elections and becoming prime minister and then McCain grabbing the presidency.  We got 3 other combinations here (7 if you wanna throw in Japan), any takers?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[OK.  I am still generally avoiding people and all that entails.  However, if one or two peeps want to go and spend an hour or two and get some food at some point, I may now be up for this.

But shoot me an email or txt or something.  Don't call or just show up or anything.  I am still going to be ignore Micheal's guests should you ever fall into this category.

If you don't take me up on this offer that is fine too.  I am still not in a space where I feel comfortable hanging out.  And like always, I am going to pull a Scopatz on any questions you ask, so please make it easier on both of us.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I am sure you are all aware, this month's <a href="http://www.fieldandstream.com/article/Hunting/The-Sportsmans-Choice-Field--Stream-Interviews-the-Presidential-Candidates">Field and Stream features McCain and Obama</a>.  We can only hope they shoot each other.  (Hey FBI people, totally a joke, no worries.) 

But tonight I want to focus on last winters <a href="http://www.lilith.org/backissues_detail.htm?id=138&amp;keyword=&amp;PHPSESSID=fe8616202be76ce310ca843cb27bbd58">Lilith</a>.  For those of you who don't know "Lilith" is the Jewish, feminist journal.  The Asian girl I bought my copy from at Intellectual Property I think was a little confused.  Seriously more awkward than buying porn.

I picked up this issue for its feature article (even better than a battle royale of presidential candidates): <b>"Is JDate Good For Jewish Women?"</b>  Their answer, a determined yes!  

Well not quite, but they fail to enumerate any good JDate does whereas the article focuses on the seven (7) specific bad things.  So even though I am a few paragraphs in I haven't said anything yet.  So let me start by saying that reading this article was a pure joy on so many levels.   Really, the best way to go about this is a series of quotes and discussions.

1-----------

<i>"Some women, largely those in their twenties, happily use the sites [e-dating] for casual sex and hook-ups; others - even those in their seventies - go online for cybersex, typing racy exchanges while masturbating in their darkened kitchens."</i>

hawt.

2-----------

<i>"How many times have you heard this exchange? 'I've met someone terrific.' 'Great. What does he do?'  I long for the day when the response, instead is 'What's he like? How does he treat you?  What does the connection feel like?'"</i>

This is actually quite true.  I know I am guilty of it AND I think I care about accomplishments of mates a lot less than the average person.  If you can be poor and happy, or if you wanna support someone, or be supported by someone, or whatever, you should totally do it.  At the end of the day it doesn't matter.  I agree with this sentiment entirely.  But you can only change yourself, so call me on it if you see me buying into the standard metric.

3-----------

<i>"A 42-year-old Jewish man posts his profile on JDate and finds his inbox flooded with 1,000 eligible women.  How come the same-age Jewish female logs on to find she'd a wallflower?"</i>

Really?  I mean really?  Sure maybe there may be some amount of disparity, but this implications for this are huge!  Does this mean there is a pool of 42-year-old Jewish woman ass that I have yet to tap into?!  

In all seriousness though, this provides the perfect opportunity to dust off the old the social engineering experiments hat.  It might be time to buckle down and buy a JDate account to tool around on it like with OKCupid.  The thousand-to-zero ratio they give I am sure are more aimed toward Jewish centers like the City, LA, and NYC (damn coastal elites) but I am confident we could get decent results out of Austin as well.

4-----------

<i>"Our expectations for relationships are so much higher than in the past, but we haven't built in a mechanism for learning how to get to there."</i>

This is actually a commentary about the feminist movement in the past 30 years.  Talking about that would fill volumes.  The point is applicable to the general population though as well.  If you really do buy into the standard set of norms and pressures, the bar for both career and relationship expectations has been set very high.  While children are taught how to succeed academically and given support system in institutions throughout the entirety of their career, the same is not true emotionally.  People are told that *must* be happy and *must* in some sort of relationship with a person who is similarly successful.  However no one is ever really taught how to go about doing this or what that means or whether it will actually make them happy.  Even people who have these 'qualities' seem to me to be incapable of imparting how they got to such a point, assuming they are even aware they have them.  The grass is always greener after all. 

5-----------

<i>"...there are a significant number of males who wouldn't be dating at all if the internet weren't an option."</i>

Wow, just wow.  They said it so I didn't have.  

All in all the article had some interesting insights and I would *highly* recommend reading it should you ever run across a copy.  However, it certainly exists in a personal framework as well.

While I was growing up (5-15 years) I was a bit of a nerd and I was <i>always</i> told something along the lines of "girls will ignore you from high school through college, but if you stick with the science thing, after college you will be more successful and buxom blonds will rain from the heavens."  More or less.  You get the gist.  As it turns out, for me, THIS WAS A TOTAL LIE.

That this sort of thinking is at least partially wrong is strongly reflected in what the commentary that "Lilith" makes.  I connect with them on this one and generally agree, even if the specifics points of contention. (I, for one, think that it is totally cool for grannies to wank it while cybering.  In their kosher kitchen or elsewhere.) 

Sure my relationship problems aren't related to trying to shatter glass ceilings for other women.  But I was getting a lot more play when being a nerdy was still dumb and not mainstreamed (before the first Lord of the Rings movie).  So now, at the time when I would have otherwise been at some sort of sexual peak, I instead have become just another apple on the poser tree.  

There is something wrong with both of these situations.  Sure it is my fault for buying into what people told me, as it is with these women who prioritized their careers far above their desire to build a relationship.   But the kludgy solution of JDate can't be all bad for all of these women.  Or the old ladies.  Or the twentysumthins.  As for me, my answer lies down a different path...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My eyes were blue again today.  All day.

I did some research again yesterday.  I think most of you know that I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome">IBS</a> is a LIE.  However, upon this latest medical round I think I may have <a href="http://www.medhelp.org/medical-information/show/983/Crohns-disease">Crohn's Disease</a>.  

I fit two out of the three risk factors, some of the symptoms, and the overlying cause resonates well with the data I have.  Basically, one's mind tells one's stomach that anything and everything you put in it is bad.  Thus your body ends up rejecting all food, violently.

This would explain why none of the IBS medicines worked for more than a week.  Also it explains why my systematic elimination of all food-types at one point or another did nothing (you know, because I was still eating).  [Note: food elimination, once you find the culprit, really helps IBS patients in general.  For me it made things worse because I would typically have to eat more, especially during the vegan and wheat/gluten free months.]

So where do we go from here.  Well before I go to a doctor again, I am gonna run one last experiment; <b>I am going to stop eating</b>.

If food itself the problem, then this should solve my stomach problem.  I will attempt to achieve sustenance through emergency survival pills like <a href="http://www.lifecaps.net/">Life Caps</a>.  Of course, I will be sure to drink plenty of water too.  I may supplement with sugar pills to increase calorie intake.

I'll start with a three day trial run.  If shows results, it'll be essentially proved in my mind.  Then I  might be able to set up some sort of system where I don't eat 3, 4, or 5 days out of the week.  I'll go to a doctor and nutritionist to talk about this.  

So if I wake up dead, <i>you'll</i> know why.  It is like my body is rejecting my life.  As if I needed something else to do that.]]></content:encoded>

All apologies this time around seem to be going <i>very</i> well this year.  If you haven't gotten yours yet, you will.  I still have a week.

Especially satisfying was an email to a certain super-marine Squid.

<b>On a totally unrelated note:</b> Being single suddenly seems a lot less glorious than it did yesterday.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just spent the last two hours trying to get my PS3 to work on my computer monitor in my room.  It wasn't getting a signal with a input plug I had never used before.  So I laboriously took the *whole* damn thing apart and then cleared it out and put it back together.  Nothing.  Nothing on the internet either.  Then I realized that it was a resolution problem coming from the system itself.  'Doh!  I felt like an idiot.  Still not picture with the new resolution, but at least I have a signal....bastards.

But really, I have had a remarkably relaxing weekend of old media.  Here are the reviews.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070334/">The Long Goodbye (1973)</a>: </b> A couple of weeks ago I decided to watch an old movie every Friday night.  This week it was the remake of the Long Goodbye.  Eliot Gould was excellent as he was NOT Humphrey Bogart, which is something you really have to try hard to avoid.  The most interesting thing about this picture though, was its cross-genre-pollination.  Since it was a remake of a movie based off of a Raymond Chandler novel, it was guaranteed Noir.  However, since it was made in the early '70s, it also had a very Exploitation feel.  Very, very strange.  But still very fun.  The only other film that comes to mind that does this is "Chinatown", but it really isn't even close.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025747/">The Scarlet Letter (1934)</a>: </b> I watched this last week.  And I of course watched it because my new favorite silent super-hottie <a href="http://www.colleenmoore.org/">Collen Moore</a> was in it.  This film was a talkie and her first "serious" work and one of the last films she ever did.  However, it was beautifully acted and the script was true as the righteous half of <a href="http://www.janusfilms.com/">Janus</a>.  The only place that they deviated from the book was in the addition of a comic relief duo.  But as this duo were simply Penn &amp; Teller 70 years ago, I didn't mind a lick.   It was very silent film in a lot of ways, which I always appreciate.  And these people must have spent the majority of their budget on costumes.  As always, I would commit the sin of adultery and many others with Collen Moore.

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0845046/">Son of Rambow</a>: </b> For laughs I watched this on Saturday.  It was good, but not as awesome as I expected.  The main story was somewhat less interesting than they billed it.  However, there were some very trippy/surreal moments.  Oh! How did that grab me?!  Worth watching, once.

<b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hedge-Knight-II-Sworn-Premiere/dp/0785126503">Sworn Sword</a>: </b> OMG!!! I waited like a year to find this, and it was awesome!  "Sworn Sword" is of course the sequel to the graphic novel "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hedge-Knight-Vol-Book-Market/dp/0785125787/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b">The Hedge Knight</a>".  Both are based off of George R.R. Martin short stories. This run seemed to only be half the length (6 issues) of the first one (~10-12).  I also must be getting good predicting Martin's work.  This is because literally the frame in which the last main character was introduced is when I knew exactly how the rest of the story would play out.  I am not talking about major events.  I am saying I knew every little plot point and twist and turn of the story for the next 3 issues down to a tee.  I didn't miss a one!  I didn't even have to read her dialogue in that first frame to know any of this either.  Part of this must be that Martin is very good at dropping subtle hints that if you apply logic to, you can know what happens.  Meanwhile, he (through his characters) is feeding you outright lies about the situation at hand sometimes.  Being adept at picking up his hints is a learned skill.  But you know what, it didn't even bother me.  If knowing what was going to happen in the story  bothered me, I wouldn't have reread the book so many times (round 7 go!).  I nom'd it like it was hawt.  I would even venture to say that I have a fairly good idea as to what will happen if he writes future short stories in this thread.  And I just had a terrible thought: Dunk/Egg slash.  Well, Seeya next post!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;&gt;OK&lt;&lt;&lt; 

All of my apologies are out!  If you got one, I am sorry.  Some of them proved to be unfounded but others I am still downright giddy about.

There really is something to be said for this tradition. You know even if it doesn&#039;t work the first, second, or Nth year, next year it just might.  And then you can treat people like human beings and move forward into the future together.  

This week is very very cramped though.  I have a presentation the day after Yom Kippur and the professor is Jewish even.  But I also have to have a paper ready to submit on Sunday at 4pm.  And of course, a day and a half are taken out of this week because of Yom Kippur itself and I am still working on backlog from last week&#039;s New Year.  

And sometime in all of this I need to fit in more yeast infections.

Grrr Busy Smash.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With Michael reading "Game of Thrones", I am getting into it seriously again.  It is bad.  But I really can't talk about it anymore, because he reads this too!  But he made it past the first 80 pages without throwing it down (I am looking at you, Anthony).  

Suffice to say, that it has gotten to the point where I have felt this real compulsion to play some 2 Ed. AD&amp;D or, barring that, Castles &amp; Crusades or HackMaster or something.  Something with gulldamn'd Gnomes.  

However, I have found ways to satiate myself in other ways, thankfully.  One of them is of course the IRL OKCupid Minigame.  The other is more oblivious.  

Ain't the Total Package yet, but is so wrong to want more ass?

PS Little edgy as tonight is Yom Kippur.  Never know when Israel will implode or Synagogues fired upon.  It seems wrong that there are justifiable neuroses on what is arguably the second most important holiday. I *still* find the Tet offensive.

PPS Is anyone else disturbed by the amount of Sarah Palin-esque straight-male-targeted porn that is popping up on the internet these days?  I mean, maybe it existed before but we just didn't know who Sarah Palin was....]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;&gt;This post is going to be a big confused mass of interrelated reflections on last year and the year to come&lt;&lt;&lt;

The <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/news/2008/09/10/flow_conference/">FLOW Conference</a> is currently being held where I am writing this. I expected a higher proportion of hot girls than I am getting.  Not that there are a few gems, but from what I have seen most fix into the "traditionally beautiful" category.  And one lady who looked similar to Kerry (I'll let you guess which one ^_^).  Boh.

<b>On A Totally Unrelated Note: </b> I am now the proud owner of Five (5) new yeast infections.  This is important because I am finally going to kick the ends of these warts.  These parasitic growths *are* (soon to be "were")  all  that is/was wrong with certain unnamed iron warships and those who manned them and my family and school and etc.  As much as I wanted to be rid of them, they tied me to those people, places, and events.  But biting your problems just makes them grow back worse.  Dermatologists should push into the life coach field.  I think they'd do well.

<b>On A Totally Unrelated Note: </b> As I mentioned before, my apologies went well.  That was slightly disingenuous since at the time of the writing, I hadn't actually received responses from half of the people.  But now I have or it is tooooooo late.  And the last batch was successful.

<b>On A Totally Unrelated Note: </b> Because I had such an intense rest of the High Holidays, Yom Kippur I was just phoning in.  This mostly worked, but then at the end, as the Gates were  closing, everything I hadn't thought about hit me.  Yizkor is always powerful.  

<b>On A Totally Unrelated Note: </b> I am shaken by the rift that have appeared in some of my friend's relationships.  I will likely take Sal's lead since he is on the ground.  But there is this little part of me too that is almost excited in a terrible way.  A couple of weeks before this, my friends in Bay Area were also having issues.  Now I seem to always be in the off-cycle.  That is to say that whenever the people I know are in loving, stable, long term relationships, then I am not AND vice versa.  So other people's lives falling apart may yet be a portent of good-tidings for me!  Is this not awful?

<b>On A Totally Unrelated Note: </b> I noticed some interesting things in the Machzor this year that I have missed before.  Judaism has strong anti-Hellenic and anti-pagan trends.  (This are clearly picked up the Christians and Muslims, though not in a healthy way since they are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism">henotheistic</a>.)  But Jews as a rule aren't anti-panhellenic.  

But one of my favorite transgressions that is recited is more or less "Forgive us for being Xenophobic."  This always gets me.  If ever there were a (still-living) people that had every right to be afraid of outsiders in all ages and eras, it certainly must be us.  But then right there in the Torah are many statues that say "Don't do X, because your pagan neighbors do it."

So the combined message is that we are a people set apart, but not to hate on the basis that others practice differently.  Not really the way evangelicals of any religion act.

Here is where is gets juicy.  One would still expect that any religious practices, though, would be completely free from the sorts of beliefs that those silly Greeks held.  Especially on Yom Kippur.  Two main instances I put together this year:

<b>1) Blood Magic: </b>  For lack of a better term.  Now the Jewish belief of the sacredness of blood differs considerably from the Greek belief that blood can be used to entrance someone.  However, both peoples have this distinct belief that blood has a very distinct meanings.  Of note, the Torah portions for Yom Kippur describe in vivid detail that would make a horror writer cry how the High Priest of Temples days would perform the High Holy Days sacrifices.   Really grabbed me this time. 

<b>2) Dust: </b> There are a couple of times where we beseech Hashem to remember that we are dust.  I don't know why this didn't hit me before, but this has got to be directly tied to the Sumeric belief in the "House of Dust."  This is their version of the afterlife that is only less stark than the Jews themselves (who generally see the question of what happens after death as irrelevant and unknowable).  But the House of Dust is a place that is sort of a formless windy medium.  Gilgamesh manages to go there and come back (as with many Hellenic heros).  But the fact that people become dust after they die is such a powerful notion that I think even the staunchest of atheists of our day would be hard to deny.  In fact, since plants get most of their constituent carbon from the atmosphere, and since we eat either mostly plants or mostly vegetarians, we truly do come from dust, replenished by dust, and bound to return to it.

It is hard to look at the world and keep a good thought.  But this year can be better.  And it can't be all that bad since Jon Stewart mad a joke about the Obamas and the McCains swinging...to Michelle Obama!

Rust never sleeps, but it is not what sunk your battleship.  Better to infect these parasites and be done with it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.wegame.com/watch/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Pokemon/">Before we get to the meat of this post, here is an <b>Awesome Oblivion patch that let's you catch and use NPCs in Pokeballs.</b></a>

Ok Now for the real deal:

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0039277/">Copacabana (1947)</a>: </b>  I am not entirely sure that this movie constitutes as "forgotten", but it <i>is</i> hilarious.  The team-up between Groucho Marx and Carmen "Shut-My-Mouse" Miranda is wonderfully awkward.  They both have very developed humor styles that are very different from one another, EXCEPT that neither one is willing to play the straight-person.  It is a true clash of these titanic personalities.  However, the film was smart enough to give them each ample time on screen with out the other one around.  Even though it clearly had shortcomings in other ways.  

Just about every word that came out of Groucho's mouth I was laughing at.  And his song, "Go West, Young Man" (or somesuch), I was on the floor for.  It made absolutely no sense...and was spectacular.  However, I still got the feeling that someone was holding him back on his racier jokes.  The one that did stick with me though was, "How can you think I don't want to marry you?  We've been engaged 10 years!"

Carmen was around in all of her usual camp, and more or less playing herself.  At one point she has to prove her identity by making out with a man who in real life is probably a faygale.  So, you know, even then it came full circle.  

All in all a very funny '40s movie.  Truly something for everyone, since there probably exists a camp-pun axis on which most people lie.  That is to say that one likely either prefers camp or puns and dislikes the other in the inverse proportion.  Rare is the soul who likes both <i>(and if you are reading this and do, you have a standing offer for a date)</i>.  But "Copacabana" does such a good job of balancing these elements, it would be hard for someone to say that they didn't at least truly enjoy some parts.

In other news, my latest batch of Gundam DVDs has now shipped.  This week hopefully!  And I thought it was a scam...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My dreams are back.  As is the rain.  Dark times, indeed.

On Sunday, I submitted my first journal article for peer-review.  Awesome.  But I have been dog tired since then.  Gripped with near complete apathy, I didn't even want to sleep.  

When I finally called it time to go to bed, I thought I would read a few pages of "The Hedge Knight" before collapsing.  Insomnia took over and I ended up rereading the whole damn thing.  I was quite pleased by this, for I feared I would dream again this night.

My fears were well founded.  I had hoped that the "Knight" would bring me dreams of the dragon, but instead I found my family turned to undead.  I felt this bound to happen, and had hoped to avoid it.

Between the weather change and the yeast infections I haven't been feeling very well.  Why can't Kamille protect us?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is overdue, and was brought up a couple of times in my mind today.

As we approach this election there seems to be a lot of intolerance whizzing about. And not just from you traditional right-wing fundamentalist sources. I see it as much from my left leaning friends and even those I would consider moderates too.  

Frankly, people, this is unacceptable.

Our choices should not be reduced to "Hope or Die", "Drill or go fuck yourself".  Stephen Colbert, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15116383">in his interview on Fresh Air</a>, talks about fighting the Culture War.  

Culture War?  Is this what we want?  Is another war of any sort really needed?  And this is exactly what he is fighting in.  I am not presupposing that he started it, but he certainly profits by its continuation.  

This path is treacherous.  We could end up thrusting ourselves into another edition of the 1960s.  Or we could start another *real* civil war.  If you want two Americas, you can have it.  <b>Is this what you want?!</b>  This is were we are going with are present dialogue, and lack thereof.  Even John Lennon wanted to be counted out of revolution.  

But this can all be avoided if you (and a bunch of your friends) decide to be more tolerant of those around you.  I am not saying you need to abandon your principles.  However, I am asking that you distinguish between you having an intense disagreement with an idea or belief and hating those whom hold that belief.  

Disagree with them: Yes.
Despise them: No.

Maybe compassion is a virtue, and maybe you don't have the time, but I swear you have something to gain by not thinking that half of the world hates you because you hate them.

Here are a couple of hot button issues where you can start:

<b>1) To the No on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_8">Prop 8</a> People: </b> 
Listen, your cause is fundamentally about the oppression of people.  You do your cause a grave injustice by being intolerant of those who hold a different opinion.  You should try to convince them, not disregard them as stupid.  Start with basics, like being afforded "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" and to actively oppress people is inherently unAmerican.  In fact this is exactly what the people who do form an existential threat (ie the terrorists) do to their own.  If they bring up any sort of religious argument, you need only to bring up the separation of church and state.  Make them frame their arguments (and you yours) solely on the basis of law and areligious morality.  If they force you into a religious argument, throw out that the Torah allows lesbianism, and thus at least lesbians should be allowed to marry.  But if you allow lesbians but not gays then that is sexist...  Rather than hating on people next door/next city/next county you should do what Dan Savage says and money to the No on 8 organization.  And vote!

<b>2) To the Yes on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prop_8">Prop 8</a> People: </b> 
This is probably a fundamentally intolerant viewpoint.  I am not saying you need to jump into writing homoerotic fan fiction.  But what is so wrong with people living different than you?  Only half of those people murdered in Germany's WWII death camps were Jewish, the other half were a mish-mosh of Catholics, Gypsies, old and infirm, and a whole lot of homosexuals.  If you want to convince the other side that you are right, you have an uphill battle. There may be an argument to be made for civil unions.  But I would think that this would fall under the "Separate but Equal" category that got us so far before the civil rights movement.  Also, don't hate your friendly gay neighbor for their life of sin, just donate money to your organization.  And vote!

<b>3) Atheists: </b>
This is a big category, so rather than having a lot of qualifiers and explaining things for various types of unbelievers, <b>I am only talking about fundamentalist, intolerant atheists</b>. Let's start with a song, huh?
 
P.F. Sloan wrote in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_of_Destruction_(song)">Eve of Destruction</a>: "<i>Hate your next door neighbor but don't forget to say Grace.</i>"

You should *not* interpret this as there is no god(s), so I may hate my neighbor freely.  (Which I fear goes on a lot.)  Rather you should instead read this as reaffirming that your moral code comes from something other than a divinely  inspired place.  And those 'religious' folk don't seem to be any better people because of their beliefs.  

Tolerance is irrespective one's beliefs.  You can and should be accepting of other peoples guaranteed right to believe whatever they want.  This is no reason to hate someone.  If they are wise, then they won't hate you for yours either.  

Also, atheists, were do you get off re-appropriating the Bohr atom and Darwin to your cause?  You have to know that this doesn't help.  Science (and it symbols you are stealing) is more or less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionist">reductionist</a>.  While your belief is strictly founded on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism">holism</a>.  You can't point to evolution and say "Thusly god doesn't exist."  You are still presupposing *something*.  Darwin doesn't come into it.  And if someone were to take all of the universe in all time and point to it and say "This gigantic, teeming differential equation is god." Even then should you disagree, you would be assuming the same amount they are.  How much stock someone puts in the atom shouldn't be grounds for possibly killing them and their descendants.  Science is just a collection of models that sometimes engineers build things with.  It isn't your robot love slave.  

And yes, I am intolerant of intolerance.  But don't hate <i>me</i> for it.

And yes, I have a vested interest in promoting tolerance.  Whenever anyone anywhere is  intolerant, my people somehow get the short end of the stick.  So if it helps, think of it like this.  If you hate a group of people for their beliefs, you are really hating the Jews.  And remember this time we "don't" have nukes.  Klaatu barada nikto.

EDIT: I saw "Religulous" this weekend, and I feel I should add <a href="http://www.scienceandhalacha.org/">these people</a> to the list of cute, yet misused scientific symbols.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Forgotten Film Friday #4</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b><a href="http://www.250films.net/list/">This site</a> is totally awesome!  I am sitting at 133, beat that!  I am a lone seven off from being completely leet.</b>

But it is kind of a misnomer this week, since I was otherwise occupied Friday night so I wanted my film on Saturday.  But you won't tell..

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi3180921113/">Nights of Caribia (1957)</a>: </b> Damn it, I am in love with other dead woman!  The lead actress <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulietta_Masina">Giulietta Masina</a> I don't have words to describe.  Suffice to say she was good enough for Fellini to marry (and stay with).  Masina was also the star of another amazing Fellini flick, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047528/">La Strada</a>, that I saw a few years back.  She really is a spectacular actress.  

If you have never seen a Fellini film, they are intense and emotionally draining.  This was certainly amplified by my schoolgirl crush on Masina, if not the character of Caribiria.  I actually had to pause the movie a couple of times and go watch Michael play Lego Star Wars because I was so caught up in it.  I loved every minute of the movie.  

This film is more of a character portrait than a story, as neo-realism is apt to be.  There really is a lot to talk about here (why magicians "succeed" where the Holy Mother fails, Italian post-war slums, self-referential movies and film makers), but why bore you with all of that when I can just talk about how gorgeous Masina is?!

So I'll compromise.  Masina herself, "Nights of Cabiria", and "La Strada" all combine in a very interesting way.  The character of Luisa/<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000733/">Anouk Aimee</a> in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/">8 1/2</a> is the wife of the in-story director.  Fellini has been accused of being self indulgent in "8 1/2" since the the in-story director is easily associated with Fellini himself.  (The most famous of these accusations is, of course, in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075686/">Annie Hall</a>.)  But if Fellini is the director then Masina is represented by Luisa.  This film is then far from self-indulgent.  After talking about the really serious, and frankly sad, issues in his films with Masina, why shouldn't Fellini be allowed to start another film with dream sequence and end it with a Ferris wheel?  Isn't he then talking about where such depressing movies actually come from rather than just making them (a theme I would argue he continues with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066922/">Clowns</a>).  And "8 1/2" itself is no cake walk...

But even when I saw "8 1/2" originally, I thought Luisa was hot.  Who knew that it was actually a crush on Giulietta Masina?  I actually tried to use Lusia as a pet name once but this got shot down pretty quick.  However it was meant with all love and respect (Dil saywhat?!).  I think I even have an email somewhere talking about how cute I thought the girl in "La Strada" was (ie Masina).

The way this movie ended blew my mind though.  But you will just have to see it for yourself.

<b><i>EDIT: In response to myself in this post, I now have a "Dead Women I'd Bang".  As the list grows, so too does my shame ^_~.</i></b>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like any dispossessed youth, I have plans for getting out of this place Sue; Ima gonna make a name for myself, I am.  Only "here" is my seemingly eternal obsession with "A Song of Ice and Fire" and my plans basically consist of temporarily satiating myself with other epic literature.  

So right now I am reading through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana">Ramayana</a>.  I am really loving the ride.  As sort of a Classics guy, the Ramayana fires off all of those lovely Indo-European neurons that I have carefully developed to the detriment of more practical affairs.  To those of you that know classicists, you know *exactly* what I am talking about.  To those of you that don't, it is kind of like being the biggest D&amp;D nerd in the world EXCEPT that the only people you can play with are either dead or in your imagination.  

More on all of the awesome little titbits later; suffice to say it is exhilarating in that way that when you <i>first</i> read the Odyssey, or the Arthurian legends, or Beowulf, etc.   But there is one topic which has so much cross over that it deserves its own post.  And I have been thinking about it lately, as well: <b>Guest Right</b>.

Guest Right was a legal, moral, ethical tradition that was held throughout vast portions of the ancient world but which is now all but forgotten.  It more or less says that guests hold a sacred position in their hosts abode.  Guest right was triggered in different ways, but breaking it was almost always considered sacrilegious.  Here are a couple of examples.

<b>1)</b> To the Greeks (and others) it was not permissible to ask your guest's name or business unless they offered it.  A great example of this is when Odysseus washes up on an island and is hosted by the Phaeacians.
<b>2)</b> A more extreme Greek example occurs in <a href="http://pages.cabrini.edu/jzurek/homer/iliad06.htm">Book 6 of the Iliad</a>.  Diomedes and Glaucus, mortal enemies on opposing sides realized that Diomedes' grandfather once hosted Glaucus' grandfather.  They therefore just *have* to be friends and run off and happily kill other people.  These seems strange to the modern ear, but sets the stage for when...
<b>3)</b> In the Ramayana, the sage Vishwaamitra is given guest right by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasaratha">King Dasaratha</a> (Rama's father).  Now the king had to perform an amazing and expensive ritual just to have children.  This ritual amounted to having a horse roam free for a year (while an army followed it, maintaining it's "freedom") before sacrificing it.  But Vishwaamitra walks in when Rama is 15 and is granted a guest right boon.  He demands Rama to help him kill some Raksasas.  The King is reticent but, ultimately guest right wins out and Rama leaves with the sage.  Puts the Abraham-Issac story in perspective...
<b>4)</b> Of course, it is possible for a guest to break guest right.  For instance, being a suitor to another man's wife and living off the fat of his land for 20 years, like in the Odyssey.  

Well, those are all nice stories, but I swear I am going somewhere with this.  

I have often been discontented with modern interpretation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lot_(Bible)">Story of Lot</a>.  Modernity has forgotten about guest right.  But Judaism (as an ancient religion) has a strong tradition of Guest Right, and generally not forsaking strangers and sojourners for we were once strangers and sojourners.  This is certainly lost in today's world.  There are so many strangers, we hardly care. We can't even open half-way houses anymore...

But Lot kinda gets the shaft in recent interpretations.  In fact, he is often cited as why the Torah represents an outdated, outmoded codex.  The bleeding edge example of this is Bill Maher in <a href="http://www.lionsgate.com/religulous/">Religulous</a>.  However, if we throw guest right back in with all of its intensity, Lot gets a different take.  

When the mob descends on Lot's family, the angels (though their divinity was unknown to Lot, as per standard guest right) were under Lot's protection.  Though the mob was doing a grave injustice to him, Lot was trying to maintain what he could of civility.  Yes, offering up his daughters was is a shitty thing to do.  But to the ancient moral compass it was the lesser of two evils.  

Modern dialogue frames Lot as the real villain (or at least anti-hero) in this situation.  They fail to account for the frame or reference in which the Torah was both written AND received.  Moreover, these interpretations gloss over the fact that the mob are in fact the ones committing the crime. 

Guests *were* people to be honoured and revered; not to be thrown out even before the garbage that is our modern capitalistic every-one-for-themselves way.  If you wanna talk about the evils of patriarchy and homophobia, there are PLENTY of current examples without turning to a misinterpreted parable from ages-gone-by.

Totally my two cents, here.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I haven't made a srs post in about a week, so I figure it is about time.

Well known is my love for GRRM's writing.  <a href="http://grrm.livejournal.com/56810.html">Unfortunately, his home was just broken into.</a> But more proof of the man's brilliance is that he ends his not-a-blog post about this with, 

"And somewhere out there, some asshole has my sword."

More or less I have been busy last week because aside from my normal duties, I needed to rewrite all of my work up to this point AND get it to work better (ie faster).  Which I totally did.  This version of the code is actually fully object oriented.  Pimp.

But I did manage to fit in my first (one-shot) game of 4th Ed. D&amp;D.  In general, some things were very streamlined as compared to 3rd.  Combat still takes too long, but less time than 3rd, so this is kind of a win.  However, they took out or changed so many canonical components that it is tough to ascribe the D&amp;D label to it.  

My notorious ability to frustrate even veteran GMs is still sharp.  The only reason I bring this up is because Michael described it in a new and apt way last night.  The mentality that <b>"everything is an opportunity"</b> is what throws people.  You would think that this would be toned down when I am playing dumb characters (w00t, Razza)...but no, they just see less intelligent choices.

This very much stems from what I see the point of RPGs to be.  If you are going to suspend your disbelief enough to represent a person in a "magical world where anything is possible", then By Golly why would I limit myself to just busting in the heads of fake monsters and avoiding spiked pit traps?

For better of worse, the one-shot got me all pumped up.  I now feel very compelled to run "A Song of Ice and Fire" game.  But it will have to wait until Michael is done with the books so at least one of the players knows what is going on in cannon (which we would be playing inside of).  Good luck playing mages, you crazy folk.

And of course, I re-purchased "Welcome to My Nightmare", since my 8-track broke.  I must be dreaming, please stop screaming!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hot Damn! I finished Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ tonight.  My heart was skipping beats every minute.  It. Was. Awesome.

But because they rarely do close-ups without space suits, I just noticed something for the first time tonight.  Glemy Toto, breeder of Elepeo Puru and Puru Two, paramour of Roux Louka, and nemesis of Haman (though they both fight for New Zeon/Axis), aside from his ridiculously blond hair, also has purple eyes!  I think this makes him Blood of the Dragon...

...and even though this is shamefully cross-genre, -medium, -style, -generation it sadly still explains Everything.  

SPACE TARGARYENS FTW!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am worried I have become too normal.  I feel the urge to burn all of my clothes, dye my hair and generally start over.

Being different is by no means always a choice, nor is it always a good thing.  But I feel as if things that made me different in the past were just signs that I am developmentally slow.  I never had the compulsion to say "go to outer space", or "live in another time period" that so many people did as kids.  Why did these both hit me in the last week?  Shouldn't I be over them by now?  Fuck, I don't even remember most of my childhood.

I wanted so much to be an adult, but now that it is here...It is like life is one big groovy orgy and I recycled the invitation and told them to stop wasting so much paper.  

I clearly need to raise my freak flag higher, but how?  Everything now has a context, and subtext[1].  Even people that don't like to be labeled are typified by "Doesn't Like to Be Labeled."  It is a logical trap.  Doing anything is probably doing the wrong thing, and doing nothing is falling into that trap.  

'Round on the ouroboros we go.  How many sand worms will get to eat me, Lady Jessica, Duncan Idaho?
-----------
1) Not that such things didn't have associated contexts before, I simply failed to realize them. Ostensibly because I am a slow.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah, I totally missed a week...and this weeks film was with a bunch of other people on Saturday.  <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Chameleon">More broken things have happened.</a>

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099871/">Jacob's Ladder (1990)</a>: </b> In honor of Halloween, we watched a film that wasn't so old, but no less forgotten.   We had the opportunity to also watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096251/">Tetsuo: The Iron Man</a> from a year before, but some people were too silly drunk and some people were too sleepy and and some peoples spoon's were too big.

The movie itself, was pretty triptastic.  It basically followed a three parallel stories (OMG HeavenHellPurgatory!!1!).  But the weaving was done very well.  There were many cries of "Silent Hill!" throughout.  Even though part of the story took place in Vietnam, this was more or less a plot device and not sufficient commentary to be meaningful.  About the only moral lesson you could squeeze out of the Vietnam parts was that Chemists are terrible people, but we knew that already.  And they knew that then.  It is/was not news.  Though I do know good chemists too.  The twist on this theme was that Chemists are worse people when they are Hippies.

And the chick named Jezzie (Jezy?) was hot.  Because how could she not be?  And not just because we saw her boobs.  In that 30 seconds she was on screen before she jumped into the shower with our fantastically-out-of-his-mind hero, I thought she was cute.  Even if people mispronouncing her name sounded like penis.  I swear, is *nothing* sacred to you people?  The next time you all come over and I make drinks, you are all getting Penis Coladas.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alright, I restrained myself for a while.  I didn't post in haste and nor inebriated.  

God Fucking Damnit, California (and Florida).  Like what the fuck is the point?  Really?

Who seriously cares if the farshtunkeneh Democrats secured control over the federal legislative and executive branches if they can't be godamned bothered to uphold MY civil liberties?  Just because I may never choose to exercise that right does not give the government or anyone else to authority to legislate my body, or anyone's fucking body.

<b>YES: </b> I may have and still do disagree with what I observed as the "Us or Them" mentality that developed on the 'No on 8' side.  But that just means I thought the tactic was wrong and not the end result of their goals.  We rise and fall together as one state, or nation.

<b>AND YES: </b> My prediction that either way the damn thing went, someone would sue someone in the courts and it will ultimately be settled there <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/11/proposition-8-h.html">seems to be playing out</a>.

But no, this doesn't make anything any better for me.  The reason that everyone in my fucking corner of the world seems so goddamn happy today is because we elected a schmuck who not only disagrees with me, but does so for the worst of all possible reasons.  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/barackobama/3388430/Barack-Obama-may-have-helped-California-Proposition-8-gay-marriage-ban-pass.html">In case you didn't know,</a><a href="http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbianactivism/p/BarackObama.htm"> Obama doesn't believe in same-sex marriage on religious grounds.</a>

We have just elected ANOTHER president who doesn't believe in the separation of Church and State.  And what do we get out of it?  Maybe universal health coverage and maybe a better economy and maybe out of two wars in a couple of year?  I would gladly use all of these coins to pay for my liberties.  Freedom at any cost!  Get the goddamn government out of our goddamn pants.

Here are the arguments which I find totally LAME that have been used to explain the situation to me, <i>which I completely disagree with</i>:

<b>1) For Play-Play: </b>Obama doesn't mean it and is just said that to get elected.  This holds no water, if I am to believe that all the candidates are always lying to me, then I really would have had to vote for Sarah Palin.  Sure you can 'Hope' that he will 'Change' his mind and renege and actually utilize the once-in-a-generation opportunity to push through Federal legislation that would end this debate...but you my friend, are living in a shanty town dreaming the union will move you to a mansion.

<b>2) Civil Unions: </b>Homosexuals are "just going about it wrong" by demanding equality rather than asking nicely for "separate but equal" status.  People who seriously believe that Civil Unions are a valid solution are just wrong.  If you apply a different label, eventually legislation will be passed that targets either marriage or civil unions, therefore making them just separate and no longer equal.  Even if you stipulate that they must under law be treated equally we would just end up with the marriage equivalent of a poll tax.  Maybe something with regards to how private insurance companies define "family".

<b>2a) No Marriage, Just Civil Unions: </b>Rightly so, civil marriage in this country is more like civil unions in other countries.  So we should make marriage a purely religious thing, and everyone civilly get married.  I would actually be fine with this EXCEPT THAT THIS IS NOT WHAT THE PEOPLE AGAINST GAY MARRIAGES AND FOR CIVIL UNIONS ACTUALLY ARE PROPOSING.  This is a purely academic argument and books and journals don't marry people.  You will find zero religious, married people against gay marriage willing to give up their legal status as 'married' so that other people can have civil unions (them included, of course).

<b>3) Nope, Never: </b>It'll simply never, ever happen/I'll never live to see the day, so maybe I should just stop worrying about it and fighting for it and getting upset.  Fuck this shit!  Who is the damnable skeptic/cynic now?!  This is the analogous opinion of those people sitting in the mid 1950s and thinking "Well, sure I know some OK black folk, but that doesn't mean they'll ever be a serious political constituency," or "Sure I have some Jewish friends, but that doesn't mean I feel there is anything wrong with landlords not allowing them to live in my neighborhood, or come to my country club."  Unjust laws require civil disobedience, not goddamn fucking complacency.  

So where does this leave me.  I am AS upset if not more so as I was after the 2004 presidential election.  Possibly more because I didn't expect this one.  So I am back where I started.  I can either fuck it all and go get a law degree and start a practice and be a real Mensch, or I can become a member of the Universal Life Church and just start performing same sex marriages, or I can wait and see how it plays out in court.

tl;dr This isn't change I can believe in.  We got given a bum steer again from what it looks like.  And this was the toned down version.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh Candida! My home and native yeast infection!  I just got four (4) more injections.  Hopefully this will kill of the last of my warts.  I would be most pleased.  Other than that, my body is hatin' on me in new and interesting ways.  My stomach has been upset since the stupid elections, but for the past day my ear has had some ridiculous ringing that won't go away.  Hrmmm...

Onto the movie!

<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char%27s_Counterattack">Char's Counter-Attack (1988)</a>: </b> The definitive end to the first main Gundam continuity, this edition was beautifully animated.  As the name implies, it followed my second favorite character in the entire Gundam Universe: Char Aznable.  Much like the first series (MSG), Char is portrayed as pure evil throughout much of the story.  Only towards the end is it relieved that Char isn't trying to destroy Earth per-say by ramming a giant asteroid into it.  He's just trying to usher in the next ice age, which will force humanity to fully migrate to space, and thus give the planet time to heal from all of the pollution and damage we have done to it.  The eco-terrorist in me was fighting my inner paladin the whole time.  Eco-terrorist wins.  Faith in Char restored.

You can guess what <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">"Kill 'Em All" Tomino</a> does to both Char and Amuro by the end.  I was kinda glad.  They both had survived for far too long.  

Speculations on Mr Tomino's relationship problems and his No-Character-Left-Standing nature abound.  But I recently noticed something beyond near every relationship failing, often times tragically.  Nearly all of the male newtypes end up on the "good-guys" side while most of the female ones end up or are manufactured on the "bad-guys" side.  Furthermore, if it comes down to a male vs female newtype battle, the women almost always die instead of the men (there are notable exceptions).  Maybe Tomino just hates on the ladies.

All in all, it was a very good movie.  Some interesting stuff with people training to be newtypes through spiritual awakening and via enhancement surgery.  Though I did struggle through all of the Char bashing.  And really I was just missing Sayla.  Though Murai's appearances were very very cool.  Both Salya and Murai are sort of broken characters.  If they had been around Char would have failed miserably. And Bright didn't even attempt to sleep with anyone other than Murai...tsk tsk.  However he did <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan?from=Main.BrightSlap">slap</a> his OWN SON! Hawt damn!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So both Super Secret Project (SSP) and Super Secret Project: Two (SSP2)have made large advances in the past week or so.  While SSP is leaking out, I think only 4 or 5 people actually know what SSP2 is.  Sadly they makametired =/. But onto the Reviews!

<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120907/">eXistenZ (1999)</a>: </b> Jeeze, these movies are just getting closer and closer to now-time.  I really liked this film.  Half for its head tripping/world switching wonder and half for Jude Law.  Some of the scenes were quite grotesque, but I liked the movie all the same.  I thought the film was similar in structure to "Jacob's Ladder" from a few weeks ago, but others disagreed.  In a lot of ways though, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">it reminded me of </a><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809/">"13th Floor"</a>.

***zOMG Spoilers**

There is really only one interesting (ie at the end of the film relevant) thing to talk about:  Are they still in the game at the end of the movie?  Unlike most films that fit into this head trope (where the answer is a definitive, inescapable 'Yes') I am inclined to say that they are no longer in the game as the film ends.  The real difference being that the game, no matter what level it was being played on, always used the same props and had certain speech patterns and cues that would draw you out and tell you it wasn't real.  However these were all gone on that "Top-Level".  

The big give away for me is the guns.  They go from bone gun technology to real guns.  It isn't surprising that the game took the spin it did given who our players were and that the game is likely designed to project and incorporate the subconscious of the players. 

The evidence against this is that everyone who saw them shoot the game designers afterward just stared.  But even here, I don't think this is too far off from reality.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Remember when it was all cold and rainy and we went out to the looking place.  There was that rare storm on the ocean between the islands and the coast.  The wind was blowing hard.  But it was the lightning that was staggering.  Some of it even stayed in the clouds, having their little disco rave while we watched.  Hoping the party would stay over the ocean.  The next day, when the sun shone, the Daily Nexus ran pictures.

That is what it felt like today when I overheard this whispered conversation.  

<b>Boy:</b> So what do you say to them?
<b>Girl:</b> Nothing.  I don't feel that way.
<b>Boy:</b> ~pause~
<b>Girl:</b> I mean, obviously they were G-d's chosen people for thousands of years before...
<b>Boy:</b> But, I mean, don't you and your friends still think they are all going to hell or something?
<b>Girl:</b> Maybe.  But its not like they are total pagans.  I don't feel the need to go out and to try to convert them like they do.  
<b>Boy:</b> But what do you say to your friends then?
<b>Girl:</b> Well I have some Jewish friends, and...

That is where I got up and walked away. Only in Texas, mi amigos, only in Texas.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone (who was reading this then) remembers my <a href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/52744.html">OKC</a> <a href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/2008/03/13/">romps</a>. [Yes, I know a straight female profile needs to go up.]

So just tonight I went back to check and see how my little munchkins were a-doing.  I was floored when I saw that Mark had <b>75 messages</b> in his inbox. And I haven't even logged on in a while!  Even more shocking (bazam!) Jessica had <b>93</b>, hawt damn!  Clearly the Walkers are getting more play than the Scopatz.  

Here are some of the creepy messages I got.  Enjoy the voyeurism while it lasts!

<b>#1 to Jessica--------</b>
<i>Hi, im 28 in the USAF and happily married to the woman i love and would never think to leave. But lately ive wanted to experiment more sexually and she's not into that. I just dont want to get to the end of my life and still have regrets you know what i mean? I havnt been with anyone else except my wife for the last 3 years, and have been tested for STD's within the last 6 months. Check out my profile for more about me. So if your at all interested in no strings attached casual sex, give me a call on my cell. 402 ### ####</i> [from San Antonio, but Columbus, OH area code]

<b>#2 to Mark--------</b>
<i>so what's up with you? do u want to have alittle fun... yeah, i know my profile says straight but i still like to have fun with guys... i just keep it low key! :P</i>

<b>#3 to Mark--------</b>
<i>you are my new leo crush and i am deeply and powerfully in love with you over the internet. YES. i am smoking hot, a good dancer, very attracted to you, and furthermore i'm from nashville tennessee so we can have a country-off. or should i say... a cuntry-off?
i have magical soothsaying abilities, and my inner eye says that i would probably vacillate between loving and hating you, and i cannot promise that you would not ever be injured by a bottle of wild turkey to the head. such is life. my AIM screenname is ~blanked~ - feel free to talk to me over the internet, because that's probably the closest you'll ever get; i sure as hell won't drive 500 miles to see anybody i met on the internet, not even if he had a 10-inch dick and a testicle condition that required he empty his balls every half hour or die horribly.</i>

<b>#4 to Mark--------</b>
<i>your profile is so much better than mine holy crap you have matching pictures!</i>

And it is totally fake! Anyways, let me know which is your favorite.  I think I am going to have to go with either #2 the classic closet case in one-line and, #3 the 10" penis plus testicle issue.  Wellp gotta go ^_~.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So tonight I started taking the jump.  I disassembled my main machine and I am turning it into my server.  This should allow my server to be up 99% of the time rather than the 1% it has been.

However, this mean that I am now functionally without a Main, powerhouse computer myself.  Which implies I will be living off of the school laptop for a while.  Soooo you know what this means...

I think if I do this right I might be able to satisfy ALL of my ridiculous desires on my budget.

<b>Here is my hilarious server build:</b>
Bare Essentials Gentoo Install
HUGE, Old Dell Server Box
3Ghz Pentium 4
40 Gb HDD
ATI Radeon 9600 All-In-Wonder, 
and 256 Mb RAM ^_~

Anyone wanna go to Fry's with me in the near future?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So this past week was rather busy, and so I didn't get to watch a proper movie.  However I did finish a Gundam mini-series (more on this later).

Basically, I had an excellent weekend.  I even got to hang out with Naole and Melody and Anthony and Robin for a bit on Friday night.  And rather than being watching them play Halo, I derailed the conversation to being educated about deviants.  This led to my favorite quote of the weekend which made the comparison between religious rites and orgasms.  Sure, most of them are faked but it is the ones that aren't that make all the trying worthwhile.  

(And if you have never heard my thoughts on male orgasms, you are in for a treat with that conversation.)

For whatever reason, I almost cried multiple times this weekend.  I almost never almost cry, and even more rarely actually do.  So clearly my emotions were running on high.  But the last time is the one you get to hear about.

<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_0080">Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: A War in the Pocket (1989)</a>: </b> Right, I know totally lame to tear up at a Gundam.  But let me explain.

"War in the Pocket" was the first Gundam not to be directed by Tomino, and rather than focusing on the Science Fiction aspect of things, it really is a coming-of-age tale during wartime.  It takes place on the Side 6 Colony (the Switzerland of Space) where both sides are running covert operations.  That is until things get messy.

The story focuses on a Mobile Suit obsessed 10 yro boy Al who is rather immature for his age.  He takes the first opportunity he can to befriend Bernie, the Not-A-Char of the series, whose MS gets shot down near his house.  The obvious conflict ensues when it is revealed that Al's next door neighbor and older-sister-figure Chris is a Federation Forces Pilot (Allies analogy, to the literal Zeon Axis).  Naturally, Chris and Bernie become the softest of paramours with out them really knowing that they fight for opposite sides.

However, "War in the Pocket" really shines in the way it abandons all of the standard Gundam tropes.  In general the pace is a ton slower than you have come to expect.  And sure, Burnie is ridiculously blond, supposed to be a newtype, occasionally wears sunglasses,and fights for the Zeon, but that is about where the comparison with Char ends.  He never ever in his backstory or in the series shoots down even a single mobile suit.  He is basically a failure.  Also he lies to impress Al, a lot.

Moreover, the whole narrative progresses without any main character ever dying or even getting close, in the grand scheme of things.  You come to expect an ending closer to Miyazaki than Tomino.   This makes the ending especially heartbreaking.  They sort of stick the knife into you.

But then they twist it around a bit.  There is a soul crushing moment where an injured Chris informs Al that she is being transferred back to Earth.  But then she gives him a prolonged kiss on the cheek.  The framing and timing of this scene is perfect and I about lost it.  

The only thing I can compare it to is "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (the book).  The ending was that well done.  I really give props to the director for doing and succeeding at something different.  I started off not liking it at all, but by the end I was fully on board.  Right in time for him to toss me back into the sea!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lately, I have been doing a lot of work on my server.  I am web 2.0-ing the hell out of my website.  Additionally, I have this cool setup that lets me remotely mount a directory as a drive (in Windows) and as a directory on my local system (GNU/Linux).  This solves my age old problem of wanting shared space between Windows and Linux.  Now, I just put it on my shared space on my server and no matter what OS or computer I am on, I can access it! Super cool, huh?

Whatevs, youz guyz.  I am totally stoked.

<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_F91">Mobile Suit Gundam F91 (1991)</a>: </b>  In my quest to watch all of the Gundams, I skipped right over the Super Deformed series and went straight to this one.  I am ignoring the fact that SD Gundam ever existed.

F91 is set about 30 years later than the conclusion of Char-Amuro plot epic win thread.  However, it was intended in production to a full 52 episode series.  The fact that they squashed it into two hours blows.  Not that it was bad, but just that they left in all of the predictable parts of the story and and cut out all of the what would have been different parts.

That being said, the initial conditions were very far off from the norm.  The intro was a normal battle sequence.  However, the moment that you catch a media broadcast that informs you that the perpetrators of the attack were flying a "Crossbones Vanguard" I was hooked.  That is right, we had space pirates!  And no Zeon! And a girl as the protagonist!

Unfortunately the Pirates turned out to have nobility and were destroying some colonies and taking over others to meet their goal of establishing a civilization free of the earth sphere.  And they were willing to use WMDs to destory 90% of humanity to reach this goal.  Jeeze!  These guys are really bad at being Not-Zeon.


<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_of_Solace">Quantum of Solace (2008)</a>: </b>I know, I know.  This movie is hardly forgotten.  But I want to review it anyway.

The overwhelming opinion given to me about this movie was apathy.  But I really liked it. The recent Bond films have been progressively breaking most of the standard Bond tropes, and I really like it.  We've seen 007 be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Another_Day">tortured</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_Royale_(2006_film)">fail</a>, and even the Bond-girl trope be subverted in this film. "Quantum of Solace" does this in two ways:   

<b>1) Bond himself doesn't save the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Montes">Bond-girl</a>: </b>  Well, ok.  So he does save her from a burning building.  But her whole deal is a vendetta against the man who killed and raped her family.  And she succeeds.  The most James does for her in this is wish her good luck!  This is such a huge role reversal for the standard issue vacuum headed Bond-girl.  I was shocked.  And I applauded.  

<b>2) Bond has trouble with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemma_Arterton">Bond-girl</a>: </b>  In fact, he gets her killed.  Wait what?  Bond's extreme seduction is dangerous?  That is new.  Really New; really cool when you think of it.  All more the pity since she was the only redhead in the film and (I kid you not) her character name was literally "Strawberry Fields", though she goes only by "Fields" in the movie.

And while we are talking about Dead Ms. Fields, we should also talk about the actress Gemma Arterton.  In case you didn't know, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3150384/Bond-girl-Gemma-Arterton-was-born-with-six-fingers-on-each-hand.html">she was born with six (6) fingers on each hand and a misshapen ear!</a>  

Six fingers, Each!  C'mon and tell me that isn't sexy?!  <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2823403.ece">In Hindustan they might have worshipped her</a>.  It is so unique.  But then to go on to become a Bond girl, that is just unheard of.  Amazing really.  This girl is hot stuff all around.

If only I could find myself an equally gorgeous "Penny Lane", I think I'd be set.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[and Google is always right!

Hate to break it to you, but some things in science are governed by consensus, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change">Climate Change</a>.

That being said, the consensus online is that, in fact, <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080319184222AAhKDJY">cats do have <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=105x1338294">free will</a>!

And a subject we failed to touch on is that cats act as an operator that removes free will from humans.

And in case you wanted to know the <a href="http://www.aish.com/shmooze/animals_dont_have_free_will.asp">Jewish</a> and <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/">Philosophical</a> answers. Which I am apt to agree with in fact (That pets don't have free will as such because they don't have the moral capacity.)

However, all sources agree that higher order animals (<a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/oq-display.php?id=58">like cats</a>) have the capacity to make decisions (just not moral ones).  Moreover, cats, dogs, apes, monkeys, dolphins, rodents, ocelots, etc. certainly have an emotional capacity.  [They'd be pretty terrible pets if they didn't.] 

So, maybe they don't have Free Will as such, but I would feel pretty terrible about imprisoning a fellow being who has the capacity to make a choice and feel the consequences of its decision.  

<b>MORAL:</b>  I am too much of a puto to own a pussy-cat here.  Maybe I should move to Los Gatos.

<b>MORAL 2:</b> FINE YOU WIN ~_~.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I had a really great weekend.  First time since undergrad that I was drinking from Thursday until Sunday.  Nothing binge-worthy; just a drink or two each night.  But the best part was the spontaneity of it.  I was planning on getting work done!  Pshaw.

Tony came in from Houston, so I hung out with him and others on Thursday and Friday.

Saturday and Sunday were dominated by Super Secret Project <a href="http://www.scopatz.com/2/">Two</a> and a Nuclear program Holiday Party.  Thankfully I wasn't inebriated at the Holiday Party.  

But the density of fun was intense! I haven't gone from Basketball to Karaoke in four hours in a <i>very</i> long time.

Still, the weekend was not without its likely mistakes...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been a while in coming, but here is my review of <a href="http://www.dykestowatchoutfor.com/index.php"><i>The Essential</i> Dykes to Watch Out For</a> (DTWOF) by Alison Bechdel.

As a child (9ish-12ish) I distinctly remember reader my mother's copy of a previous compilation.  I recalled it being interesting but more or less a Lesbian soap opera.  Which it is.  Now don't get me wrong, I grew up watching soap operas.  I like them, especially the ones with a more comedic bent.  Which DTWOF also is. [As an aside my favor with soaps probably stems from the same neurons that enjoy epic stories with long complicated plots].

But it is more than a Lesbian Soap!  It certainly functions on that level, but as a kid I totally missed all of the commentary and debate that goes on. Ms Bechdel certainly has her own beliefs that come through.  But through all of the various characters a lot of opinions get expressed about every subject with relative objectivity.  Like in real life, nothing is ever 'solved' or 'decided'.  But while reading it I kept thinking, "I've had this conversation!  I have had this argument!  I have felt this way."

Since the comic has been written every couple of weeks since 1987, each strip is deeply entrenched in its own temporalness.  It is beautifully morose document of American/Lesbian political culture from the initial AIDS crisis through the disillusioned Clinton years onto 9/11 and the following and ongoing two wars.  There is that old <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/602/">South Park joke</a> about how Cancer is now the sympathy disease, making AIDS funny.  DTWOF emotionally doubles down and covers both with pure seriousness.  In light of our more irreverent demons, this is impressive.

Now before I go any further, I want to make sure that you understand that DTWOF is very, <i>very</i> funny.  Seeing the old hat Lesbians tackle with the conservative republican Lesbian is a hoot.  Not to mention the Jewish man who is more of a dyke than his bisexual girlfriend.  But a significant portion of the humor is well-placed background puns and opportune Shakespeare and Talking Heads quotes.  Repeating them wouldn't do them justice.

At first glance it is tempting to say that the main character Mo is the author mies-en-scene.  This might even be to first approximation true.  However, after learning something about Ms Bechdel herself, the comparison seems less meaningful.  Yes, Mo may have stepped out of Good Ole Alison's shoes.  However, she took of running to different 5k marks.  

Which brings me to another point about the naming schema used.  I know about the Law of Conservation of Names.  Mo's girlfriend was named Sydney; eerie...  Bisexual-stealing boyfriend named Stuart, anyone?  How about one of the main character's being named Toni (Lord help you if you know anyone by *that* name though!). 

Mo was very identifiable.  At least to me.  Maybe 'Our Heroine' was meant to be that way, but there was just too much to ignore safely.  Smart, but not quite the intellectual cut, plagued by the worlds problems there isn't much she can do about, goes through long celibate streaks, cuts friends off when they lose her trust, Democracy Now obsessed, basically monogamous as a risk prevention strategy, likes girls with boy cuts and fetishes, and values her privacy.  Yes, our heroine rings many bells.  But then again, maybe I am projecting.

Still, DTWOF provoked me to think; never a bad state of affairs.  

There was a time when we were developing <a href="http://www.scopatz.com/projects/okc/">the Mark profile</a> that <a href="http://leximancer.livejournal.com/" class="lj-user">leximancer</a> said something like "There is nothing that makes Mark gay. <b>He just fucks boys.</b>"  He was right and we fixed it.  But still it took me back.  That same concept, that being a Lesbian nowadays is a different thing than being biological female and having a strong gender sexuality preference to other females, is repeated and struggled with by the different characters throughout DTWOF.

But this brings us to an important point in our Straight-Until-Proven-Otherwise culture.  The analogous contra positive is that maybe, just maybe, you be a guy who fucks girls or a girl who fucks guys without being straight.  Maybe you can fuck both girls and guys with impunity without being Bisexual.  You don't have to buy into the culture identity that surrounds the gender preference.  

Now it has been said (by ex-patriot Idahoans) that I am their gayest friend in Austin.  I certainly wouldn't deny it.  But not because I associate with the with Gay or Straight culture.  If anything I associate with Lesbian culture (but you'd have to know my mother to understand that one).

Lois in DTWOF, upon finding out that Stuart has a habit of dating women who then turn out to be Lesbians says, "Jeeze, what is with those guys?"  I wish I freaking knew.

Duly prompted, I am renouncing the "Straight" tag.  I don't think it really describes me.  I am now (and likely have always been) the quainter, more direct "boy who fucks girls".  I think that there are enough criticisms out there of Straight (and Male) culture in the milieu that I need not provide examples.

Maybe I am crazy (You Decide?), but I think this makes sense.  I dropped the "Nerd" tag with 90%+ success.  I think it helps me define who I am a lot better.  And who knows, maybe it will even help me find a meaningful relationship again.  <a href="http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/12/tanehisi_coates.php">And maybe she'll even be Jewish.</a>  And then we might even make a symbolic affirmation of our commitment to one another.  That's right, we'll open a joint checking account (0xDTWOF#7)! 

But I get ahead of myself...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am delightfully, shamefully, obsessively enthralled by "<a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/series.jhtml">A Double Shot at Love</a>".  Much to my academic disgrace.

The show is basically a dating 'reality' show with twin bisexual women as the love object.  Separately of course.  We still believe in strict monogamy on MTV apparently.  And that right there is what makes this show amazing!

There is this carefully cultivated sense on the program that taboos are breaking like a monster truck on thin ice.  However, anything even slightly non-whitebread is squashed rather quickly.  Let's look shall we?
<ul>
<li>They kicked off <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10568">Claudia</a>, the Dominatrix, in first episode.</li>
<li>The most wave-shot Surfer dude, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10565">Trevor</a>, is the one both the *ikki twins agree on.</li>
<li>Out of the twelve women competitors only two were even vaguely butch.</li>
<li>The first was <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10567">Bella</a> who was let go in the first episode because she has tattoos :gasp:!</li>
<li>The second, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10574">Nicky</a>, was kicked off in the third episode because the twins trapped her into saying that maybe sometimes she has thought life would be easier if she had a penis.  On some level isn't that just restating what feminists and equalists say about female inequality in this country.</li>
<li>The stereotypical frat boy <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10564">Scott</a>, who is operating under some head-based hanky code, is still on the show.</li>
<li>Luckily, east coast elitists like <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10571">Jen</a> are eventually also weeded out by the non-plastic people clause.</li>
<li>However, <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10553">Coop</a> and <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10552">Ben</a>, token Black and Jew, are gone in episode two.</li>
</ul>
Alright, so the *ikki twins have fairly narrow vision in terms types.  They are bisexual but also bimodal: Straight Boys or Fem-to-the-point-of-passing-as-Straight Lesbians.  And the show relies on base tropes for its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkX8Q3iq-gw&amp;feature=related">humor</a>.

But then again, maybe there is something to be said for just having a show about twin bisexual women on television.  I am not saying that it is revolutionary, but it is not without social context either (sort of like Willow on Buffy).  Let's face it.  50 years ago you couldn't have had a show about homosexuals on TV.  25 years ago you couldn't have a show about lesbians or gays.  10 years ago you couldn't have had a show about bisexuals on TV.  

So maybe we are progressing.  Maybe we are going somewhere.  Maybe we are liberating ourselves.

But then again, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-anti-gay-violence,1,455717.story">maybe not</a>.  Oh Mein Papa, <a href="http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/Gay-groups-attack-Pope.4821155.jp">you are not helping</a>. (On the plus side the Google query "Gay Pope" now returns valid hits.)]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my first foray into fiction other than "A Song of Ice and Fire" in a long while, I read "<a href="http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/treason.shtml">Treason</a>" by <a href="http://www.hatrack.com/osc/about.shtml">Orson Scott Card</a> a couple of days ago.  A noteworthy event, believe you me.

As his second novel (revised version, like with "<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234726.Hot_Sleep_The_Worthing_Chronicle">Hot Sleep</a>") it is in some ways quite raw.   The first third of the book was essentially transsexual erotic fiction.  So if that was the bait, consider me hooked.  I somehow don't think it was.

The story was told from a first person future perspective.  This was probably the novel's biggest fault.  This perspective naturally leads you to piece together plot points that the reader has yet to see.  Thus, outside of aspects of the universe that you haven't yet been introduced to, there is no way to surprise the reader.

Luckily for Card, his strength lies in the ability to create detailed and interesting worlds to explore.  So even though our hero Lanik Mueller never did anything that he hadn't previously hinted that he would do, his wanderings are still rather interesting.  In some sense, he has a very Odysseus-eque travel.  On this universe-centered story telling, "Treason" is most similar to his other works "Hot Sleep" and "Wyrms" and "Hart's Hope".  All four tend to decentralize the importance of the characters and see them more as eventual and necessary arrivals on the stage of the great time-dependent differential equation of their respective worlds.  Lanik Mueller isn't important, but someone like him is.

Unfortunately for us Lanik Meuller seems to operate with the our modern day moral structure and not his own.  This is a consistency with Card though.  The genius of Heinlein is that he creates elaborate places that have their own detailed and intense corresponding ethical structure.  And even while doing so, he denies the existence of absolute moral relativism (see "Farnham's Freehold").  The genius of Asimov is that he was able to single-handedly define and expand the morality of robots and AI.  The genius of Bradbury is to point out those human universalities that exist regardless of technology level.  From all of the Card I have read (which is <i>a lot</i>) he never seems to care about these things.  

The foreign aspects of his works are in the science/magic alone, and the similarities lie in that his characters act as if they were to pinnacle of modern personality types.  Perhaps his books have a broader appeal because there is some cold, familiar comfort in this setup.  However, in retrospect, I am tempted to think it is somewhat of a cop out.  

Maybe he isn't good at mixing up moral frames of reference so he steers away from it in general.  Which is fine.  But this gets back to my main criticism that the main characters are more static than my bar of interest would normally allow.  Luckily, his early works tended to be short, not giving time for his characters to do much other than explore the world.

So in summary, I liked it.  I couldn't put it down.  But whether this was because I was fascinated with his uncomfortable writing of transsexual, lesbian, and gay sexuality or whether I liked the world is hard to say.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Melody and Robin and I got into religious discussion where I think Melody and I were both playing a very weak Devil's advocate half of the time.

More or less, what I don't understand is why people (hard atheists, etc) bag on Religion (as a concept) because specific religions in specific times do harm and negatively influence people, where on the other hand they give Science and/or Law and/or Medicine and other "rational" pursuits of thought.

The so-called logical studies have been and will continue to be just as much if not vastly more so tool of discrimination and hate and racism as Religion ever has.  I could sum this point in one word: Nazis.  But really there is so much more to the subjects of Nuclear, Chemical, Biological, Mechanical Weapons, Jim Crow Laws, and Medical abuse and malpractice that it isn't worth filling up this space entirely.  Oh and then there is that whole military industrial complex thing that we invented, whose express purpose is of death and yet produced almost every innovation in our kitchen today. 

My basic point is that I think Religion is unjustly bashed.  Not that it doesn't sometimes deserve it.  But it isn't as if the Pope speaks for all faiths everywhere.  

But on another level I get that some (few?) people have had their lives negatively impacted by people whose minds have turned to hate and who use their faith as a justification.  This is especially painful with family members.  Which is what I am guessing leads some to denounce All Religions as hateful and irrational.  

But still I struggle. Isn't it the people that are being hateful and irrational?  And isn't Science and Logic, which are trumped for their superiority, used hatefully just as or more often on a gross scale than Religion?

And no, there is no excuse for Hate.  Only intolerant of Intolerance, right?  I don't know; You decide!  Maybe someone out there has some gem of wisdom that my Yiddishe tuchas has missed.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><i>
Is Elvis Dead?<ul>
<li>Yes</li><li>No</li><li>Maybe</li><li>Maybe Not</li>
</ul>
</i></blockquote>

So New Years Eve was fun.  But then again, it was terrible.  A couple of seeds that were planted in 2008 came to fruition and I am not entirely pleased with the yield.  Still, I am enough of an academic to appreciate the results even if they are disappointing.  

I think I communicate in a fundamentally deviant way.  However, no matter how often I try to explain to people what (little?) I have been able to figure out, it still seems like I need training wheels to cope with my friends and they need training wheels for me.  

So rather than listing resolutions, here are some of my trip-ups that I hope to learn from.

<b>Mistakes:</b><ul>
<li><b>Extro-/Introvert:</b>  So apparently everyone under the sun believes that I am an Extrovert.  I thought I made it pretty clear that I flip between the two based on the taxonomy of those I am around AND that largely the Extroverted personality is a mask because "being Extroverted is more socially acceptable" [Keirsey, et al].  Even my Introverted friends don't like it when I am Introverted.  Isn't this incentive to not be "who I really am" [whatever that means]?   </li>
<li><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_troll">Trolling:</a></b> There are clearly major modal communication differences between myself and my friends.  The most common way that these manifest is through the use of Trolling.  Just because many people in a group wish to use this method of communication doesn't imply that it isn't something I am not sensitive to nor that I enjoy it.  On the one hand, I am willing to meet people halfway and compromise.  On the other hand, If I tell people that they have crossed the line a dozen times and they refuse to alter their behavior it shows me that they don't really value me as a friend.</li>
<li><b>Blake:</b> I am so sorry and I did deserve the troll.  Even if you weren't offended, I still find my own behavior abhorrent.  Not that you can read this because the post is locked.</li>
<li><b>Social Contract:</b>  I think it has now been shown, twice and painfully, that the relationship contract that currently exists for my friends needs errata.  Once again I am eager to meet everyone halfway.  I want <i>constructive, active, descriptive feedback</i> on my life and for my friends to challenge and watch out for me. (I understand that this may be confusing since there are certainly things I won't talk about, but other than those topics everything is fair game.)  And also, I absolutely 100% require Respect in Friendship. No respect is clear grounds for termination.  But what do you want?  For me not to generate drama?  I am fine with that; I don't like drama and try to minimize it.  But is drama 'over(?)analyzing' things?  I don't have a concept of limits here. Please help!</li>
<li><b>Desperado:</b> I don't want to be drunk and be taken advantage of.  Yes, I did give my consent, but I was rather inebriated and tried saying "No" for like an hour (in drunk-time).  I was under the impression that my friends would step up and stop me from doing something drunk that I would regret.  Unfortunately, because of <b> {Social Contract} </b> and the fact that *some* friends could not stand, let alone step anywhere, intervention did not occur.  It was slutty in all of the bad ways and none of the good.  (And before anyone from Live Oak says it, Dion++)</li>
</ul>

I realize that these are all my problems. And like Dan Savage says, I am the lowest common denominator in all of them.  But this is why I am slow: I have identified what I need to change, but the option-space of what to change into is So LARGE that without your help I won't ever be able to narrow it down to a few reasonable choices.

GRAH GRAH GRAH Angry at self and others!  How many times can my self-image be shattered in a day and for me to still remain sane?  I think I need some sort of stabilizing drugs. Maybe I should self medicate.  Booze.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My mother left me today on a jet plane.  In Austin.  She got on an airplane and flew out of here.  No, she did not leave abandon me in some foreign airport to fend for myself.  Picking pennies out of fountains to purchase over-priced cinnamon rolls.  Nope.  Not this time, again.

But this is a fairly important milestone.  It marks the end of the "Robin + Anthony = Wedding" for me.  It also marks the End of Fun, wherein I must remain devoutly studious*, until my qualifying exam (which is on Friday January 16th).  No working on projects.  No hanging out with friends.  Preferably, no or limited chatting online.  Forced "normal"-person schedule.  Basically, all I am allowing myself to do is sleep, eat, workout, housework, wind-down, and study.

On the plus side, I might now have 15 minutes to myself for the first time in two to three weeks.  I need to relax and recover from everything. But Wait! This is my life, so No!  I think even Robin and Anthony have gotten a couple of days or somewhat regular behavior.  However, I *have* to dive right into the MOST IMPORTANT TIME OF MY LIFE TO DATE.  

The qualifiers will literally make or break me; they will decide whether the decision to come to UT was right or a near complete waste of time out of which I may(?) be able to scrounge a masters that I can apply for a couple of years before I hit the ceiling of its usefulness.

In typical Michael/Scopatz** fashion, the ridiculous timing of such important life events is fully outside of my realm of control.  Stupid Life operator acting on the eigenvector of Me.  At least the heart attack of the quals being on Monday is over.  When the world throws you a curveball, it tends to break the blender you were making tasty and refreshing lemonade in.  

So in summary, take this as notice that I'm gonna zip into Introvert mode for about a week.  More or less, since I won't have time to maintain my emotional state, having me think about yours is nearly totally out of the question.  

Seeya on the Flip Side!
Wish Me Luck!

-----
*Note: I have been studying basically everyday since November for this.  I even managed to squeeze in 6-8 hours a day while my mother was here, post-nuptials.  So what I mean here is more like 8-14 hours a day.  Hell, I like neutrons, but I didn't wanna marry them.  I need a real fake woman!

**EDIT Note: Michael/Scopatz has nothing to do with anyone other than my Family.  Micheal is my mother's maiden and my middle name.  I use this term as a convolution of those two parental aspects within myself.  It seems this went misunderstood.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since I have been studying a lot recently, I have been listening to a lot of music. So much so that I got bored with my own ample collection.  

Though I have known about <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> for a while now, only in the past week have I started listening to it with any frequency.  It is really great for those genres where there are a lot of artists who do a couple of songs each that are really good.  

Thus the Doo-Wop 'station' is wonderful.  As is the <a href="http://www.eurodancehits.com/erotic.html">E-Rotic</a> one I made, which more or less plays a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music">EDM</a>.  However, through Pandora and some side research, I have made two awesome discoveries:

<ul><li><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Octagonecologyst">Dr. Octagonecologyst</a>:</b> This AWESOME pun is an album and stage name of Kool Keith.  It apparently helped define Trip Hop.  I am very tempted to buy this one.  I think he is coming to Austin in a few months too.</li>
<li><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elis_Regina">Elis Regina</a>:</b> Just when I was about to take it down, it looks like I have another name to add to the <b><a href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/75618.html">"Dead Women I'd Bang"</a></b> list!  This talented and gorgeous Brazilian singer from the '60s - '80s recorded a version of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waters_of_March">"Aguas de Marco"</a></i> that is still hailed as the best selling Brazilian track of all time.

It is so popular, in fact, that <a href="http://lifehacker.com/399156/how-covervilles-brian-ibbott-gets-things-done">someone</a> should do a <a href="http://www.coverville.com/">Coverville</a> of it.  I have actually been a fan of "Aguas de Marco" for a while now without knowing it.  I first heard it through the percussion group <a href="http://www.uakti.com.br/">Uakti</a>.  "Aguas de Marco" is the first song of theirs on <a href="http://www.samurai.fm/play.ram?id=2362&amp;t=6&amp;p=15">this sample stream</a>.  The acclaimed Elis Regina version is found below.  It is hard to say which version I like more.</li></ul>



I still haven't found a singer in Occitan to steal my heart.  Suggestions?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>QUAL UPDATE:</b> The practice qual went well with Erich yesterday.  This instill a bit of confidence, though I am wary of hubris and am still studying my brains out.  Which is why I am going a bit loopy.  Three days left.  Two days of studying. I am wreck.

Whatevs.  Since it has been in the news a lot lately, I thought I would put in my two shekels about Hamas (not strictly the Palestinians) and Israel.

I think there is a lot of misunderstanding out there about what is going on and why.  One of the major ones is that somehow Israel and the Israelis don't care about the Palestinians or the Palestinian people.  And by extension, American Jewry feels the same.  This is quite ignorant of the Israeli peace movement and slaps the faces of the conscientious objectors in Israel.  The situation is much more complicated.  On both sides the argument there are extremist and peace movements.  And sadly as time goes on, both sides seem to radicalize further.  All it takes to destroy the hope for peace on either side is one rocket or one suicide bomber.  

Additionally, the western world refuses to acknowledge that the present situation directly derives from *their* flawed WWII and post-WWII.   Analogy between the situation in India/Pakistan is apt for what happened in Israel/Palestine.  But that is too huge of a post to go here.

Basically, there are two main objections to the current engagement, both of which I empathize with: 1) the use of White Phosphorous and 2) the disproportionality of casualties.  

1) So for most of yesterday the media was all a-buzz with the fact that Israel was using chemical weapons.  If true, then yes the commanders who ordered it and everyone else 'in the know' should have to answer to an international war crimes tribunal.  However, this was debunked more or less by the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j2vQ8GynRSG8lBEQir4RtXL9Ib2AD95MLHHG0">Red Cross</a> today.

2) This gets into the motivation for the war.  The argument goes that the Israelis have Hamas (not the Palestinians, remember) so outgunned that the 900+ total civilian and soldier deaths is not fair to the ~20 Israeli deaths thus far.  Implying that having more Israeli dead would somehow legitimize everything.  Ummm No.

But before we a-go stone castin', let's look <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/casualties.html">historically</a>. The Israelis have always had very low death rates in their engagements relative to the size of the forces they went against.  I would argue that this is the only reason the state continues to exist today. The current numbers are not inconsistent.  For rounding sake, let's say this current war is at a ratio of about 50.

Now let's do the numbers for America, shall we.  There were approximately 3000 people who died as a result of 9/11.  Iraq has had a Coalition forces death toll of around 4000.  Afghanistan has a number that is close to 1000.  So roughly as a result of one terror attack, we have 8000 dead.   Iraq alone has somewhere between <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/">100,000</a> and <a href="http://antiwar.com/updates/">1 million+</a> dead.  This puts our US ratio at &lt;10 - 100+! Voting for Obama doesn&#039;t mean that these Iraqis didn&#039;t die in your name or &#039;unfairly&#039;.

I guess what I am trying to say is that the situation is a lot harder to piece apart and understand than who shot a rocket at who, or who blew up whose house.  And if you think that the western world has any credibility in the matter think again.  The US maybe more so than others, but we were just as fooled by Arafat as anyone else.  And that is only as long as we don&#039;t judge others harsher than we judge ourselves (ie why we sat out of the UN&#039;s condemnation last week).

Peace should be pursued for peace&#039;s own sake.

*Also, food for thought, why do left-leaning in this country people support Hamas over the Israelis, yet not the Tamil Tigers of Eelam over the Sri Lankans? 
**Also, I am a believer in Land-for-Peace and a Two State solution.  Hopefully within my lifetime or sooner.  I do not deny the Palestinians their sovereignty.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So, if you didn't already know, I passed my qualifying exam today.  Also I feel the need to post in my tired, and post-barhopping state.  So I apologize for spelling and grammatical errors.

Basically, the situation is all to surreal to feel right now.  In some way the success of me passing (a good thing) yields a predictable path that my life will take for the however many years.  However, if I had failed (bad), then my life may have taken a more interesting and unexpected turn here in a few days.  

Yes, failing would have called into very question the nature of any and ALL of my academic pursuits.  It would have meant admitting that, once again, other people are unfathomably smarter than me.  And rather than dealing with them, I would have likely ran away again.  Shit is getting real in Austin anyways and it is time to step up or ship out.  But back to the main point.

Passing my quals, in some very large sense, while opening up the option to continue on with my PhD here, closed off the multitude of other options that are ANYTHING ELSE I COULD HAVE EVER DONE WITH MY LIFE.  Maybe this is being over-reaching, but on some level I find this kind of sad.

Back in August I promised to give this second round of testing it's fair shot.  Which I think I did.  My mom took this to mean that I had basically given up.  But really, I think it meant that either way I would have been satisfied with the results, knowing I had given it all I could reasonably give it. I was prepared to be content with the outcome.

And now, more than anything, I am tired.  

But don't get me wrong.  It isn't that I am not happy, it isn't that I am not exciting, it isn't that I am not elated that I am <i>actually going to get my doctorate</i>!  But truthfully, it didn't really hit me until I talked to my parental unit. My mom was thrilled since I will be the first one in her line to get a doctorate (though not to become a professor).  My dad called me from India to wish me congratulations.  My grandmother used three contiguous exclamation points in an email she sent me!!!  Maybe this was worth it.

Lastly, I am thrilled that my life will finally be unpaused.  There are all these little details I can now worry about again.  AND I can forget about all of the big details I can do nothing to change.  THAT was the *real* success of the day.

---
Needless to say, it takes a village to get through this sort of thing.  I would like to thank every member of the tribe (local &amp; virtual) that helped me get through this trying time.  I know the past 5 months have been no easier on you than on me.  In any even thank you all for your support, especially considering the lack of a sole personage dedicated to the task.  You did great!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, congratulations America.

You proved us naysayers among you that this is not the 1960s or 1970s.  This is not Israel.  All it takes is one crazy person who wants to force their will on the rest of us.  But here and now, that crazy person has enough respect for democracy not to go out a-ssainatin'.  I think this makes me happier to be an American than anything else.

But life and the <a href="http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/#045356">Savage Lovecast</a> tromp on (first minute+).  I have a ton of ideas in my mind that have been building up but did not get published because of quals.  I am sure you will see at least some of those forthcoming.  But for now, I have a couple of awesome things to show you that I have done.

<b><a href="http://www.scopatz.com/">Twitter on Website</a>: </b> My latest Tweet now shows up in my status bar (on the left) of my website.  Easy little hack I thought up.  Took me about an hour to implement.  But it is fun and makes everything so much more DYNAMIC.

<b><a href="http://www.heradvocate.org">Other Blog</a>: </b> As some of you may or may not have known, about a year ago I started an environmental blog over on blogger.  The idea was to keep LiveJournal as a personal space and Blogger as a professional one.  Thus was born <a href="http://www.heradvocate.org">HerAdvocate.Org</a>...

...Which I promptly became too overwhelmed and too under-motivated to update regularly.  However, with the passing of my quals and the realization that I might have to get a real job in a year, online advocating is back!  I promise this time to rant at least once a week on it.  In fact, if I am posting here and not there, poke me.  Hard.  With an ICBM. 

So here is what I want you, my readership, to do please.  Basically if you Google Reader or some other RSS feed, go to the blog and add it to your feed.  That way you don't have to remember another website to go to and I get people who are actually reading the thing.  (I find it hard to right without and audience in mind).  If you don't have an RSS Reader, you really should get one.  And add HerAdvocate to it.  Also, I won't copy the content from there over here.  So if you wanna fanboygirl me out, you will need to go there too.  Additionally, if you have any friends or relations who you might think would be interested in reading it, please also let them know.  Thanks a ton in advance.  

OK that is it!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think my body is depressed, if not my mind.

My only evidence to this end is that my body doesn't want to wake up (which only happens when I am sad) and I am playing video games again (which I use as escapism).  And that there is nothing that I have control over that I have any damn right to be sad over.

For example, after I failed my quals the first time out I spent way too much time on Disgaea, and then a shamefully long amount of time of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion after that.  Not that I am anywhere near that commitment on Civilization Revolutions yet, but stirll.

I don't want to work; I basically wanna get on a plane and fly away.  And sleep.  Man I need to kick this.  I have a ton of stuff to do.  Luckily my debugging went well today because 5 months ago I had the good sense to write readable code.  Unlike 9 months ago.  

But that is that.  Probably part of it is this conversation Shawn and I had about girls last night.  He has a more scattershotgun approach than I do.  Thus his advice sort of runs counter to the conventional wisdom that Kerry Prime gives me (and others). In fact their seem to be two camps:

<ul><li>The peeps who have known me since high school (with whom I tend to agree)</li><li>And the folks who I have met afterwards, who generally encourage a broader choice range</li></ul>

I don't know.  I am sick of thinking about this.  And I am tired.  And all I wanna do is play Civ and sleep and get my PhD.  And GO ON VACATION.

/endrawr 

At least I am having fun ranting on <a href="http://www.heradvocate.org/">otherblog</a>!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is just something about the Bay Area that no longer feels like home.  But that makes visiting friends and family here all the more intense!  It is no longer a place I can always come back to and so it really *is* a special occurrence.  

So to the AustinKnights and others, Texas is home.  Certainly after Raleigh, and maybe after Idaho, I feel that this has been true.  Maybe home is more than where I hang my copious collection of hats.  But even though I may have taken the fedora with me, I'll be back for the others!

God, I love traveling!  And vacations!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I finally made it to LA.

More or less peeps all up and down the CA coast agree it is time.  If you don't know what I am talking about, that is ok too.  

On a totally unrelated note, at least three people know what Super Secret Project 2 is.

The days are filled with driving and seeing friends for like 2-4 hours and then moving on to the next bunch.  As whirlwind as it is, I love them all and wouldn't trade this vacation for the world.   Even though it is crazy I am still managing to recharge.  

Of particular interest is that I am so euphoric about the experience, I don't find moving from one social structure to the next the least bit jarring.  Maybe it is all the pent up emotion and ways to communicate and knowing that I have to express myself NOW or it simply won't happen.

I could use a shave with Occam's Razor.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I am currently killing time in Hollywood.  Specifically, I went to <a href="http://larryedmunds.com/">Larry Edmunds Bookshop</a> to pick up some more stills.  I have been planning this for months.  It didn't quite work though, since the list of names I brought in was not what they had available.  This didn't stop me from buying anything though ~_~.  We just had to be creative with what we looked up.

I restrained myself and *only* purchased one <a href="http://www.colleenmoore.org/">Colleen Moore</a> still.  She is dressed in traditional Spanish/Mexican garb.  It is hilarious/awesome. All of their Seven Samurai folder was cleared out and so I could not get a picture of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875477/">Keiko Tsushima</a> (who plays the sexually active girl in Seven Samurai).  Also their folder's for "Nights of Cabiria" and "la Strada" were empty.  So the picking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulietta_Masina">Guilietta Masina</a> were very slim.  But I did manage to get a few decent ones.  Specifically, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm2320209920/tt0050783">this one</a>.

And randomly I found a poster for "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019800/">Dangerous Curves</a>" featuring Clara Bow.  It screamed out "Don't You Want Me?!"  So I bought it.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today is so nuts!

In addition to being everywhere always; I also had to do a fair amount of real work with the one of the slowest internet connections I have ever had.  It was lame.  And then there are the logistics of how I am going to get the car back to my folks. It is just nuts.

Anyways I am off to see Shane perform for the first time since he entered college.  Should be good.  I am excited.  

Ownward, to the dance!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well ok...not that much fatter.  But I did eat a lot of bread!

BUT I am back in Austin!  I had an excellent time on my vacation.  You may have noticed the near radio (internet) silence on my end in the past week.  Here is what I was doing.

I flew out to Santa Barbara on Friday and had dinner with my Grandmother and parents and then went back to the Santa Ynez Valley and crashed for the evening.  I got to see stars and mountains and cats and dogs and the country and everything was awesome.  

The next day I drove up to Walnut Creek (in the Bay Area) and hung out with Sean and Christen and their friends from UCSC, Zach and Heather and Sean's Robotics team.  We went to Dave &amp; Busters and generally had a good time and then went home and crashed.  But not before throwing out Sean and Christen's Christmas tree at 2 am on February 1st ~_~.

Sunday, I drove down to Morgan Hill (my High School Stomping grounds, still in the Bay) to hang out with Kerry Prime, Ryan, and Garrick.  We went to Super Taqueria and then played "Magnet X" while hanging out.  Together the three of them managed to decipher what both Super Secret Projects are.  We also drove by a Swedish outpost in the hills and some petrogylphs left by the natives.  Kerry and Ryan (whose anniversary we were crashing) had to get back to the City so they left at around 5-6pm.  Garrick and I then went to drop in on Sean's folks place to say goodbye to Sean and Christen and "Hi" to his parents.  Garrick and I then went to dinner at Black Bear in Gilroy where he quizzed me on girl issues.  Then I drove back to Santa Ynez to sleep at my folks.

The next day , Monday, I hung out with my cousin Aaron in his Chemistry lab at UCSB.  Randomly, I got to see one of my undergraduate research advisers, Kevin Plaxco, who happens to be Aaron's for-real adviser.  That was nice.  I watched Aaron do some research and we walked around campus and Goleta Beach.  I saw the sun set over a familiar ocean.  I could see Anacapa Island almost perfectly.  Oh and we had the lunch buffet at Flavor of India!

After that I went down to LA, hoping to see Meenon.  Unfortunately, I couldn't see her until 11 pm (after she got off of work).  So I ended up in the Valley with nothing to do for four hours.  After a couple of hours of humming and hawing, and Andrew calling me <i>"So Fucking Shy Sometimes!"</i> (See <b>Introvert</b>!), I called up my friends.  Mowi and Twin got to me first and we ended up having dinner at BJ's.  We had a good time and talked about past and recent events, though we tried to avoid that line of conversation for like an hour.  

I did then finally go to Meenon's place in Culver City.  She and Jesse and I hung out until it was time to go to sleep.  Unfortunately, Maggie's father went into the hospital, so I did not get to see her =(.  

The next day was a planning disaster.  With nothing to do and no where to go, I went to Hollywood and bought prudy pictures (movie stills and posters) from a shop there.  Then I settled into a Starbucks for some internet time.  About half and hour in, my Aunt Chris calls and invites me back up to the Valley for dinner with her and my Uncle Bruce.  I make the drive *right* before rush hour!  After I visit with them for the evening, I drive down to Irvine to see their son, my cousin Andrew.  He and I go to the Cheesecake Factory and catch up and have coffee (there was a truckload to catch up on)!  We go home, surf the web for a while and then go to sleep.  

For those who are following, the next day was Wednesday.  This is when I get to see my brother Shane, who goes to UCI.  He has class at weird times but we hang out around this.  When he is in class or rehearsal, I go to cafes and work.  Then he and his friend Rachel (iknoeright?!) and I hang out and go to the Jacuzzi.  We go back to his apartment and watch Bollywood Music Videos on YouTube.  I then sleep on a mat on his floor.  

Thursday, he and I hang out more and then I get to see my first show of his since he started College.  It was the one Professor choreographed show of the year. My God!  It was spectacular.  I have seen a lot of dance shows and musicals in my time and this was some professional quality stuff!  Dancers could only be in two of the dances max.  The first one Shane was in was called "Artifacts Suite" and was a really superior piece.  My favorite part I can only describe as a spider-movement chorus line!  The other one he was in was inspired by Van Gogh's "Starry Night."  The Dancing Van Gogh was a little hokey, but I still more or less liked it.  I really enjoyed some of the other dances (including the one my father dubbed the Lesbian workout), but I don't have time to go into that here.  

The show got out at 11 pm.  I said goodbye to Shane, picked up Andrew, and drove to the Valley to crash at his place.  For tomorrow was the LARP...It was a dark and stormy night.  No foolin'!

Friday, Andrew and I went to IHOP with Mowi and Twin, where someone was going to eat someone's meat ;).  Then we did some last minute shopping and got over to Malibu Creek State Park.  The LARP is a continuation of Ye' Olde D&amp;D Campaign.  So I got to play <b>Razza</b>! w00t!

Except that logistically the LARP was a complete catastrophe.  It was rainy and disgusting.  Within 3 hours I was completely drenched and mud had soaked through my shoes and socks and reached my feet.  If this had been a normal camping expedition and I had been running it, I would have called it off.  If this had been a normal camping expedition and I was simply going on it, I probably would have wimped out on account of all of my gear being in AUSTIN.

What I ended up doing was running out to Sports Chalet, buying waterproof boots and a $2 flashlight and sleeping in my parents car (which they had loaned me).  This compromise prooved mostly acceptable.  I was still wet during the day, wet and cold at night, but at least I was dry and warm while I was trying to sleep.  

Now don't get me wrong, the game itself (while in character) was a blast!  I loved playing Razza and Undead Flunkie #2 (infinite respawns!).  Hanging out with Rob was super fun both in out of character.  Seriously one of the better RPers and cooler people I have met in a really, really long time.  It is known. Mowi made an awesome Phoenix, though Siyona did not come out so she and Razza did not get to meet again =/.  

However, being Undead Flunkie #2 with infinite respawns (of 2) underscored the fact that all of the other people who were supposed to play NPCs bailed.  Which was lame.  Four people on plot and two NPCs for 30 something PCs.  We were way understaffed.  Additionally, I only saw Kai and Rachel at the LARP for like 5 minutes.  Rachel got sick and had to go to the hospital, so I guess this is OK.  Hopefully I will be able to see them next time.

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/LARP#">LARP pictures are here!</a>

Sunday, after the game, I went to the After Game Party!  Andrew and I then left to go back to Irvine.  I had to get there to return the car to my parents who had just gotten out of Shane's show.  My whole immediate family and Shane's Rachel then went to dinner.  I said good bye and then had them drop me off at the Irvine Spectrum Center (a big mall with a Ferris wheel and a lot of Middle Earth references).  This is where I met Shawn for a couple of hours.  We walked around and then Andrew joined us.  I bought a duffel bag and then we got tea.  It was really good to see Shawn.

Andrew and I went home, I found out my paper has been accepted for publication, we had buttery nipples and peanut butter cup liquor shots and surfed the web.  After such a long day we crashed.

Monday morning I caught a Taxi to the airport and flew back to Austin!  Anthony and Robin and I went to a wine bar and drank and ate cheese.  A fitting end to a great escape!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The dating/couple/partner issue has come up a lot recently.  So I thought I would address it here, privately.  As fate has it, the I get to squeeze out some time to right this on the night after Valentines day.

Basically, on my trip back to CA I was grilled pretty heavily on the dating issue.  Being the social butterfly effect theorist that I am, I was more than willing to listen to every one's opinions and pipe up when I disagreed.  But still, there is a lot of advice out there advocating a lot of approaches many of which seem to counter balance one another.  Let's start with beliefs that are in the consensus.
<ol><li><strong>I should be dating now:</strong> Yes, even I have come around to this point of view.  Finally.  Seeing where being single gets me, it is time.</li><li><strong>I should expand the set of whom I am interested in:</strong>  I actually beat most folks to the punch on this one.</li><li><strong>Light dating is part of &quot;the game&quot; before finding a serious partner:</strong>  Not something I am particularly interested, but I agree it is likely needed.</li><li><strong>There are institutional barriers to dating:</strong>  The friend group in Austin, the amount I am out of town, how busy I am with school, and the amount my family visits all pose significant difficulties towards meeting new people where I live and getting out (around here) more.</li></ol>Ok now that we all agree on that we should talk about the things there are a wide range of opinions on.  A while back, Julie posted a thing on her LJ that was a list of qualities that she would like to see in her partner.  Rather than doing anything like that, or a more advanced version with some sort of point system, I am just going to talk about what people told me.

Definitely the biggest issue of them all is that of my deviance kink.  (After some introspection: I am renaming the Short-Hair Fetish to the deviance kink.  I was raised in a very &quot;Its Normal To Be Different&quot; way.  So Rather than latching onto the normal stuff, I latch onto the different stuff.  Short hair on women signifies many possibilites, but all of them imply a level of independence and deviance.  And it is totally obvious without even having to talk to the person.)   Not that by any means I am attacted to all deviants or all types of deviants or exclusively to deviants.  However, there are serious doubts in my mind that I could be happy in a long term relationship with someone who didn't challenge to social norm.

So this is why, to all those peeps who have told me/thought that I should to give up/expand the short hair fetish, I got so indignant.  I took it as asking  me to give up this <em>very central aspect of my personality</em>.  Which under no circumstances am I willingly renouncing.  Because it is convenient, lets take the hair thing again.  I am very attracted to some people with long hair, but these gems have something to sweeten the pot.  Like LARPing or, being a hot goth or punk or metal chick, or hell, even being Jewish is deviant enough.  And I am open to other forms too.  In summary, many people think I should drop the 20% of girls and go after the 80% that are more normal and play the numbers a bit better.  I disagree.  

Additionally, the dating strategy I should employ has had several different recommendations.  Shawn suggests bars and clubs and parties.  My cousins suggests vigorous online database lurking (though with different methods).  Basically everyone agrees that my chances would be better in Southern California though.  I really don't know what strategy I am comfortable with.  Bars seem sleazy and online only seems lazy.  And the magical third option of doing various activities to get out more and meet people is impacted by time constraints.  I will likely have to implore all three.

The acceptable range of personality types people also disagree on.  I don't really know what I want here either.  I think I am more interested in someone who is extroverted so that I can be introverted.  And someone who is artsy and/or academic, though these are not deal breakers.  My personality is so fluid that it is possible that the recommendations that people give me are based on what type they perceive me as.  There is absolutely no consensus here.  What is really most important to me is that they are attracted to me and my many sides, not a particular projection. 

There is more that I could talk about that people disagree on.  Should it be requirement for me me to think my partner is hot (and is this a female or male trait) or is that just thinking with my dick because appearances will change over the long haul?  Is it important for the partner to get along with my family?  Friends?  Are some fiends opinions valued more highly than others?  Am I attractive enough? What does that even mean? Am I to the people I want to date? Am I confident enough to approach them?  Am I deviant enough? What the hell happens when I get out of school?  Do leagues (eg 'outta my league') even exist? The problem gets insurmountably hard.

Even though a series of light relationships is not what I am looking for, they may answer some of these questions.  On some level this is resetting me to square one, which is rather humbling considering all of my past relationships.  I thought I was past this stage.  I didn't ask to be sent back here.  But there is no point in being bitter at life.  A series of light relationships is better than being in no relationship, I just need to find them.

Thoughts?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesh...I am tired.

A lot has been going on lately.  After my vacation to the west coast, a week later my parental unit (mother, father, and grandmother) visited for a week.  While all of this was quite exciting, pleasant, and needed I am now far behind on real work.  Not hopelessly so, but still.  Since my parents were leaving on Saturday, I decided to take the rest of Shabbat off and relax.  This turned out to be kind of a disaster.

<u><b>On A Totally Unrelated Note:</b></u> I invited one of my friends over, but was abandoned.

<u><b>On A Totally Unrelated Note:</b></u> I desperately need to speak to one of Varys agents, but have not recently had the opportunity.

<u><b>On A Totally Unrelated Note:</b></u> I am poor because the Birthright deposit wiped me out.  Yes it is free.  Yes there is a deposit.  And yes I plan to go, though it is with my brother.  I wouldn't go alone.

<u><b>On A Totally Unrelated Note:</b></u> I haven't been as interested in dating lately.  But as my coz points out, this could just be that my parental unit was in town.

<u><b>On A Totally Unrelated Note:</b></u> I have been having strange, reoccurring dreams lately.  By which I mean nightmares.  They are, more or less, me watching a fight between Duncan Idaho from "Dune" and Cpt. Ahab as played by Gregory Peck from "Moby Dick".  Frankly, they need to stop.

<u><b>On A Totally Unrelated Note:</b></u> I received an unexpected email from an old friend.   I responded but have heard no further reply.  

<u><b>On A Totally Unrelated Note:</b></u> I have, through this delirium, been wondering at the validity of online dating.  Maybe it is just making me think I am putting myself out there while I actually am not.  I am not getting any AND I am not doing any in the flesh flirting.  I mean, maybe I never did.  I used to think that any sex, even bad sex, still was worth it on some level (new experiences, etc).  Since I have reversed decision I feel like I have an obligation to myself to go out in active search of things that I enjoy.  But HEY!  Guess who is super busy and whose parents are in town?!

<u><b>On A Totally Unrelated Note:</b></u> I realized today that I don't have any hobbies that involve other people or that can't be done alone.  This should probably change.

On a related note, I should probably get some sleep.  Why that homework took me 20 hours of which I will probably only get a 50% on, I will never know.  As I have said before, I am just stupid enough to not know when to quit.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh Hi!  Haven't seen you in a while LJ.  How have you been?  What have you been up to?

Me?  Oh not much really...

More or less the past month was awful.  Pretty much since my parental unit left Austin (in February) has seen a near complete collapse deep in the heart. 

1. My roommate has been a wellspring of negativity of late.  Normally, I try to let him pass in me and through me for fear is mind killer.  Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.  

2. Work has nearly killed me.  I know I have said this in the past.  But those times I expected to be working.  I feel like I haven't gotten a break (though I had that week in CA in February) since mid-November.  

3. With a notable, apathetic exception I felt abandoned by the peeps in the ATX.  And no, I do not mean the delicious sugar coated puffy sugar Easter-time treat. 

This had two severe consequences (and a bunch of minor ones, like stopping me from blogging):

1. I started playing WoW again.  I wanted to see new content from 'Wrath of the Lich King' but since I am leveling with a friend, I have yet to even buy the expansion =/.  But I am back on Argent Dawn.  Which is sort of surreal, but it is pretty much the way I left it.  

2.  I stopped sleeping.  I have completely missed three nights of sleep this week.  And this is spring break!  I have yet to make it up during the time that I have been sleeping.

This paper I was writing I submitted on Sunday night.  Since then, I have had a little bit of time to try to get my house in order.  From what I can tell, it has partially worked.  The friend group tension may have settled down a bit.  The roommate spigot may not be dripping my way for the nonce.  And school has settled since the mad month dash to the paper is over.

Now I can work on rebuilding (and sleeping), rather than self-flagellation to relieve pressure. Not that there aren't still problems but I am looking forward and trying to put a positive spin on things.

So I am sitting here in a coffee house that I have never been to and trying to figure the future out.  Most people have five and ten year visionary plans.  As do I.  However, I think what I need is a bridge plan.  A one-and-a-half year plan, if you will.  Something that will get me through the remainder of my foreseeable tenure in Austin.

My recent feelings of abandonment brought this into (house) stark relief.   I need, need, need the kind of support that I just am not currently getting.  I have decided in some earnest to start dating again.  

All attempts with online pursuits have failed, quietly.  So I am gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way.  Which is fine by me.  There are a number of systematic barriers to this (working six days a week, using Latin phrases in normal speech, et al).    I feel that a many of these can be hurdled permanently or systematically.  But beyond clubbing and returning to the cave-den forthwith, what are these ancient mechanisms?

I am going to go back to the archaic technique of getting out there, doing activities, and generally meeting people (research permitting).  Sadly my 1.5 year plan as it stands is mostly devoid of such activities.  So I need YOUR help.  Here is the applicable part of the list, please comment and add things that you think I might enjoy doing.  Specifically things that get me closer to the sexy deviants out there.

1.  Go on Sierra Club sponsored hikes etc.
2.  Going to Schule more often.

Neither of these seem like real winners in the getting out there scheme of things.  But they might be help.  Please I need help.  I think I have this academic problem of tending towards solitary activities.  If I act, I act scholastically.    This manifestly evident by my late night research into Sir Bedivere's heraldry.  "Fly my pretty priests! Fly!"

Thoughts?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I made a post which you don't get to read, world.  As much as I love you Google, perhaps I don't want to be in the middle of your three-way with Yahoo! and Microsoft with absolutely all of my thoughts.  

But no worries! Here is some keen information that you totally need to know about me, like for sure man/dude/guy/hypno-toad.

A couple of sleepless knights ago, I was wanting to read something as I crawled into bed.  However, I was in the rare mood of not wanting to read any GRRM before I went to sleep.  So I picked up my copy of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's "Idylls of the King" and took a stab at it once more. 

For some reason, this time it clicked.  This time through everything makes sense and I am able to read it unhitched.  And it is amazing.  First off, I noticed keenly that it is not "The Idylls of the King", but rather Tennyson's idles about King Aurthur.  Tennyson himself is in possession of the idylls, not Aurthur.  A mistaken presumption that I was under before.  

Secondly, it took him about 40 yeas to write, a Virgil-ent feat.  

Thirdly, there are portions of the epic that just jump out at me as some of the most beautiful examples of English that I have ever seen.  Considering it is on a chiefly British fairy tale, such examples are all the more native to the tongue.

<b>Here are a couple of my favorite quotes:  </b>

In the Tennyson retelling, though Aurthur sees Guinevere once before he marries her, he never speaks to her.  Moreover, as Aurthur was simply dressed when he saw her, Guinevere has never even seen the good King before the marriage.  Their vows are magnificent.

<i>And Aurthur said, "Behold, thy doom is mine.
Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!"
To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,
"King and my lord, I love thee to the death!"</i>

Wow!  "Thy doom is mine!" typically forebears someone getting their ass handed to them in battle, but it is *somehow* more powerful as wedding words.  On the one hand this is the sort of sappy love-at-first sight mumbo that one would expect from a Romatic poet.  On the other hand, you might think that whenever someone professes so strongly like this it can <b>only end badly</b>, like Romeo and Juliet.  And then you remember, "Hey, this is King Aurthur.  That is Queen Guinevere.  This DOES end badly!  Al, I see what you did there..."

Which brings me to an important point.  Does anyone else think that Aurthur in these legends is curiously indifferent to his wife's infidelity?  This has always bothered me, but I think that in retrospect, it sort of doesn't matter to him.  I mean he is trying to drive out heathens and find the Holy Grail and much more important works than the love of one woman and the dishonor of one knight.  Moreover, he keeps his initial vow to the letter.  Later after he has failed in his greater tasks he comes back and besieges Lancelot, and fails.  Lancelot is allowed to live out life as a hermit and Guinevere becomes a nun, light penance compared to being burned to death (Ser Mordred's initial sentence).  Isn't that kinda weird?  I mean we stress fidelity a lot in this culture.  Everyone else makes much a-do about the adultery, except for Aurthur.  Strange... 

My other favorite quote is about Ser Gareth (Arthur's nephew) being forced to work in the Camelot kitchens (by his mother) for a year and a day before he may ascend to knighthood.

<i>So Gareth all for glory underwent
The sooty yoke of kitchen-vassalage,</i>

So awesome.  Gareth is kind of a puss so I am not a huge fan, but the brother knows how to take a sooty yoke in stride!

Personally, I have always been much more of a Homeric fan than Arthurian.  I have read the Iliad enough to call it an old friend and the Odyssey a shameful amount rarely rereading a translation.  Yes, even more times than my current seven run-throughs of "A Song of Ice and Fire".  

There is something about the libertine attitudes of Homer that make everything more adventurous and dangerous than the stiff hierarchy of a medieval court.  In Homer, people go places, do things, and die.  In Arthurian tales, they walk around England spoiling for unbelievers to kill (good) and a cup (meh) and the Queen takes a consort and everyone gets real upset except for the King who says "Meh, I am busy looking for this cup right now."

Don't get me wrong, I like the King Aurthur stories as much as anyone (especially Sir Gawain and the Green Knight).  But they lack the independent streak of Robin Hood and the supernatural badass of Beowulf.  Rather they are cool like Faust. (Does this make Malory hot like Goethe?)

But for whatever reason, for now Tennyson has rekindled my feudal passions knightly!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok! Last weekend I went to Gainesville for a conference.  I was expecting it to suck (as per last year) and therefore I would get some time to post.  But no!  It was freaking fantastic.  Here is the fallout. Ok maybe fallout isn't the best term for a nuclear engineering congress...

Well, it seems as if the Austin Experiment turned out to be the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028950/'>Grand Illusion</a>.  I expected to be more upset, I suppose, but really, it is another data point in the convergence loop of my life (more on this later).  

So rather than being all bent out of the shape, I am determined to go North of the Wall and maybe find me a unicorn or something.  Really I only have <a href="http://scopatz.doesntexist.com/1/">one</a> more year here in Austin and then the entire world is open to me!  How fucking pimp is that?!  Yo, werd!  

More seriously, I can easily fill a year with research.  I can think of at least 4 full papers that I want to write in the next year.  Hopefully at least two of these will pan out.  

So it is clear that the conference motivated me.  Good.  It did.  

I have about a month before I go up to defend my PhD proposal.  Luckily, I have so many potential avenues to exploit, writing the document in the next week and half, shouldn't be a problem in the least.  It is looking like I am gonna do this thing; I am going to get my PhD! Victory!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Loop Over My Heart</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have always been a proponent of not wasting time on dating people you know you are not interested in.  That being said, what one wants and what one thinks one wants are typically quite disparate when one starts dating.  So like many things in my life I have followed a classic iteration, hopefully converging on that one person who is so molto bene that you don't risk giving them up.  

<b>The point whole point is that date dissimilar people who gradually get closer and closer to one another and you learn more and more what works for you and what doesn't.</b>

<u>Example:</u> Say you start off with the girl down the street.  You should then probably move to the one from the wrong side of the tracks.  The difference here is large because you don't have any sense of who you are.  Then try to find someone who is a more middling version.  Someone who roughly combines the positive traits from each.  Maybe you decide that you liked the girl down the street a bit more so you find someone that more closely resembles them.  However, this fails and you suspect you need a real man, more like Duncan Idaho and less like Lady Jessica. Look we are getting closer; they are both strong character from Dune!  While trying to decide if Elvis is alive or not you think that someone more enigmatic would be better to project your feelings on.  Then you wonder if mythical beasts in a far way land are enigmatic enough for you?

And maybe all of these characterizations are grossly unfair (half of them don't exist), but the method is sound.  From each encounter you learn, and get closer and closer to that mythical one (or several, as the case may be).  

So why is did this come up?  Well, blame Kerry Prime.  She pointed out how she is holding out hope that I might someday bring home a nice, only slightly unusual, girl.  Sean, for one, has for years claimed that I will marry a nice Jewish girl (uuugh, curse my bones he does).  

Being single for some time, I dated around to humor the "open up your options, put yourself out there, don't limit yourself" crowd.  But, it failed (in a non-self-fulfilling way).  I know more or less what I want.  I have converged to within acceptable tolerances, yet, of course, I can always go further.  

So while I am intrigued by the possibility of someone that my friends and family think is a good fit but is outside of *my* norm, I sincerely doubt it will happen.  It defeats the purpose of doing the iteration to break out of the loop now!

Naturally, I take a similar model for other aspects of my life.  Check it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So at the ANS Student conference, at the last nights dinner they handed out bingo cards.  The cards contained phrases that if a speaker said them, you could mark it down, and you know play bingo.  Silly, right?

But I noticed that the words in the little boxes formed word phrase primitives.  Sweet!  So I put a few cards together and then spun a quarter on top of them.  Where the quarter landed I would record the phrase.  Here are the top three &quot;random&quot; sentences that I got.
<ul><li>104 reactors operating in US Hydrogen production secure the borders against HEU (Highly Enriched Uranium) knowledge transfer.</li><li>I wish I were in your shoes 9/11.</li><li>A number of nuclear students enrolled in airplane impact at the mention of TMI (Three Mile Island) or Chernobyl.</li></ul>

BINGO!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I think the trick to graduate school is the ability to work really, extremely hard on something that you generally feel is a distraction.  Then after such a herculean effort, the further ability to fully admit that this thing that you just built completely and utterly sucks.  Congratulations, you have just made a worthless piece of crap!

I mean you had the inkling before hand that it might have sucked a little.  I mean you have done this before, right?  You know some of the pitfalls...but not all of them.  And after all, that is what editing is for.  To catch this stuff before you embarrass yourself in front of any one except your adviser.   Someday, though.  Someday. 

Someday, you just might get it right on the first try.  After all, you can at least fake being smart.  And you have this <i>corpus</i> of work behind that proves that you might have known something at some point in the past.  This time it can't be that hard to bust out, again.

But then, think what you have sacrificed.  You don't have any friends.  No social life to speak of.  A few hours on Friday nights and Saturdays spent doing chores.  You haven't had sex, let alone good sex, in years.  And the words that you pen are only fit for burning.  This hardly seems worth it.

Jeeze, am I glad that I am not some of my colleagues!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am super grumbley over this PhD proposal.  SOOO Hellooo, LiveJournal!

I meet with my adviser again on Tuesday.  Coincidentally, this is when a series of Mobile Suits will save me.  Mostly I was really looking forward last week to not having to write a lick in this week.  But no.  Because of suckage and revisions I will have to spend another half of a week writing.  

But even more than that, I want to be anywhere but here.  It has rained on my day off for the past two weeks.  And of course the rest of the week it is sunny and amazing.  LAME.  I could say that I don' know why Austin became so negative and other places so positive, but that would be a lie.  Do you want to hear a poor, sad lie?

"<i>Then moon is made of cheese and I don't know why Austin became so negative!</i>"

Still, there remains hope. I think that when I come back from the summer the situation will be a lot better.  Moreover, I fucking get to leave for the summer!  I am sorely tempted to start this a month early and just leave now.  I don't even have anywhere to go.  Great! Even better.  I have a tent.  And a bear barrel.  Bring it.  As cool as you are Austin, you are city filled with people, who are sometimes lame.  

Maybe I am altogether to sensitive to my surroundings.  That would explain a lot.  It explains why I need positive individuals.  Barring that, the cold comfort of strangers is superior to any sort of negativity.  But even better than that is no one at all.  

So meanwhile, in the intervening month, my bike is muddy and I am only sated by mid-nineties slash.  But tomorrow, or tomorrow tomorrow, or tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow, I will be gone, fighting for peace.  Get well while I am away.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the people that need to know have mostly been told.  My K.D. Lang-ing has gotten out of hand.  Every day or two I am intensely broken-hearted.  I am not sure if this desire is really justified.  I feel that there is and was a connection and that is certainly important.  Meanwhile, in a cruel twist of fate, the Austin populous has gotten significantly hotter.  Would it be right to pass up Austin opportunities just for a chance to record on her album?  Fuck, are there Austin opportunities?  Will there be a rally in Raleigh?

Just because they are foxier doesn't mean they are anymore available, were I the last girl on Earth.  The Economist: "<i>The city's dykes mostly stood firm.</i>"  If only they were talking about womenfolk.  Or Austin.

I wanna be whomever she want me to be.  But I don't know who that is.  I don't think we ever really find out who our partners want us to be.  We simply get better at guessing.

The <i>right</i> answer to this question is to just be myself! But like that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foxx6X9k3hQ">the Who song</a>, my definition of self is so fluid it is hard for me to pin down.  If you have been the test subject of my recent beard/no-beard rants, I apologize.  Or if you have ever been clothes shopping with me, you also know this.  Every article is a statement of purpose.

It is so much easier to just adjust to someone's expectations.  But I have to respect that person, and they have to be at least as deviant as I am.  I fucking wasn't always this way.  I used to just not care.  But the joys of social engineering have ruined such apathy for me.  

I feel like a fat lump of <a href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundanium_Alloy">Gundamium</a> (a lame, non-existent plot device) without her.  She knows who Yusaf Islam is and my heart grows fonder with every mile.  

Oh K.D. Lang, are you just a unicorn?!  I look forward to the day when I may cry "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTv9m8c6hnw">Hallelujah!</a>"]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Compulsively Writing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I think I am going to grow my beard again.  I don't know.  Maybe I am unsettled with my visage in general and the beard is an easy point of contention.  Maybe I will become a three pronged rock-lobster.  ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.  FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS!

Outside of the latest rash of sexless work, I have been Gundam focused recently.  If this starts to turn you off, don't stop reading, I swear this relates back to the real world and gets interesting.

Ok so the first series I finished within the past month was "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Fighter_G_Gundam">G Gundam</a>".  It. was. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwyVV5_orBo">awful</a>.  Now that we have an understanding, there were exactly two points of significant interest.  

<b>1)</b>  The main plot revolved around an evil machine (lit. called Devil Gundam) and its supporters that was out to destroy humanity in order to give the Earth time to heal.  Sort of a post-apocalyptic eco-terrorist Dragon Ball Z.  Almost but not quite worth it.  However, at the end, one of the main bad guys eventually comes around and understands that humans are also a product of nature, and trying to destroy them as an unnatural blight is oxymoronic.   

In light of Earth Day, this is particularly interesting.  For a while I have been struggling with the fact that some of the assumptions that the Green movement makes seem to be founded in this "People are Wrong" attitude.  The whole idea behind Zero Population Growth is founded in this. Now what they really mean is that poorer people, people with different political ideologies, and people who tend to have darker skin should stop breeding.  But Sweet Char Aznable, if Master Asia in some Japanese kids show can understand that humanity is a natural phenomena than they should be able to as well!   

If someone wants to make a point about not impacting their environment, then they should become a vegetarian, or stop driving or flying, or just let themselves die if they feel that strongly about it.  /sigh

<b>2)</b>  The other point where G Gundam gets props is that one of the supporting men isn't.  They do a very 
good job of covering up the fact that George de Sand (of Neo France) is probably a woman.  They did name the character after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sand">George Sand</a>, the male pen name of a famous French woman author.  The real person took the name to get published; the cartoon character probably took the name to participate in  the inane Gundam fight.    

Other evidence includes the fact the George de Sand uses a special attack called "Rose Bits" which is very very similar to the funnel attacks used in previous series by exclusively female characters.  Moreover, even though the French princess in completely enamoured with George, s/he seems not to care.  George expresses multiple times that he is only fighting on her behalf because it is what is expected as the representative knight of his country.  

I applaud such gender subversion aimed at 10 year old boys.

The next series I watched was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_Wing">Gundam Wing</a>.  If you follow my twitter, you have seen a lot of hilarious stuff on this.  However, the theme of this more serious series was whether the use of robots in war was permissible.  

We seem to be headed down this road (unmanned drones, etc) so it will likely come up.  Naturally, the argument for is that robots will make your war clean and efficient (as long as you trust who is running them).  The argument against is that it takes the humanity out of war.  More than just the nothing wagered, nothing lost, the characters in the series seemed obsessed with human suffering. Mechatronics cheapening all prospects of real pain.  

Either way, the US is arming little robots as we speak.  There hasn't really been a debate about the ethics of this.  Much like the name of the game is ICBMs these days, I doubt there will be.  But maybe there should be.  I think I would rather be shot down by a soldier than an overgrown roomba.

Comments? Thoughts?  Pen Names?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Hey Cowboy, This post ain't for the weak of heart!</b>

I had the most incredible weekend!
<img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SfTQ4God7iI/AAAAAAAAAx4/76W-48pBtv4/s800/DrumCircle.jpg" />

So it started off of Friday night with me sending out my PhD Proposal. This, of course, left me a stringless, dessicated husk of a man.  Therefore I proceeded to go to a show at the Vortex called <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A767636">Mr. Z Loves Company</a>.  I went with my friend Jayme.  It was amazing.  I guess the show was about Mr. Z's repressed homosexuality.

As the Austin Chronicle points out, it wasn't necessarily amazing because of the shock factor, but because it was so well done.  To set the mood, with a vat of Crisco, Mr. Z sticks a 12 foot long dildo up himself.  And other, than the maid orgy opening song and dance, Mr. Z's anal antics were by far the most tame of the show. 

I loved it!  I mean, how often can you pay to see that sort of thing.  And so cheap!  I continue to be impressed by the Vortex. 

But then, the next day, Saturday, came <a href="http://eeyores.org/">Eeyore's</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore%27s_Birthday_Party">Birthday</a>.  This is a big hippie bash where people come all dressed up with their freak kids.  Fucking Incredible.  The picture above is of the drum circle that I jumped in and out of many times.  Dancing = Hardcore.

How the hell I missed this the previous two years I have no idea!  It takes place in the park right down the street from me.  With thousands of people!  I only knew about it this year because of Jayme told me the night before after Mr. Z's  (See how this all ties in?)  Next year, everyone?  Seriously, I took a picture with Twinky Freidman!
<img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SfTQ5rFxEMI/AAAAAAAAAyI/EJQf8c6XaXo/s800/MeAndTwinkyFreidman.jpg" />

And my sweet lord, the women!  You know how I get excitable when I find one girl who outwardly breaks enough norms for me to be interested in them.  This was like swimming through a sea of them!  Is this what it is like to be straight-laced?  That almost makes me want to be normal.  Almost.  For comedic effect.

We may secede tomorrow; get to Texas while you can!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>So it looks like I might have an expanding LJ readership.  Welcome!  I write to my audience, both seen and secret.  So in honor of this I will write an entirely selfish post.</b>

The noun-phrase of the day is "<i>Body Fat Percentage</i>".

Alright, we all know I have weird physiology.  Still my quest to become a fine specimen continues.  I reached my target weight years ago, but because of these strange and previously unknown dietary issues, it hardly ever looked like it.  As it is, I still think I look over my actual weight and fitness...which is unfortunate.

But moving on, weight isn't everything.  Muscle mass is (once you are within 10 pounds or so) just as important.  Because I can feel them and have been doing specific exercises, I know I have some decent abdominal muscles.  The goal now is to get them visible.  

To do this, <a href="http://www.takefit.com/212/how-low-does-my-body-fat-percentage-need-to-be-before-my-abs-will-become-visible/">men need a body fat percentage of about 10%</a>. Women, lucky for them and their other assets, need between 14% and 18% to have visible abs.

I am currently estimated at about 15% <a href="http://www.linear-software.com/online.html">Body Fat</a>.  So really, I need to loose 5% body fat, which at my current weight shakes out to 7 pounds.

Ok cool, not hard right?  But wait!  This isn't really loosing 7 pounds, Mr Slimfat.  This is more like converting 7 pounds of fat into 7 pounds of muscle.  Or at least some combination of loosing weight while maintaining or gaining muscle mass.

This is tricky.  Loosing weight (through diet and exercise, of course) is mostly done through aerobic exercise.  On the other hand, increasing muscle mass is done through anaerobic exercise.  And there are only so many hours in the day.  

So it turns out that doing anaerobic workouts <i>before</i> aerobic ones increases the value of both rather than the other way around.  This has been precisely my strategy for a while now.  But it became clear that I needed even more aerobic exercise throughout the day.  This has been gained by riding my bike more now that the weather is good, rather than walking <i>everywhere</i>.

Additionally, I found this website called <a href="http://www.fatsecret.com/">FatSecret</a> which lets you input everything you eat in a day to your profile.  It will automatically calculate a kilocalorie estimate for you.  Neat!  There is a real barrier to excess food if you then have to account for it by typing it into a website later that day...

But even better than that, you also can put in what work outs you have done day-by-day and it will estimate the kilocalories burned.  It even accounts automatically for the energy used by sleeping or just being awake!  

Then it outputs a daily side by side summary table of what energy came in and what energy left.  Since it takes 3500 kilocalories net-burned to loose a pound, this is super useful for getting a rough estimate of how you are doing.

Naturally, I thought about writing a program to do basically the same thing a couple of years ago.  But since they couple it to much larger databases than I have, they ship a better product than I have time to write.

My goal is to attain fine specimen of a man status by my birthday!  I think I can.  I have the time, will, and tools.

Thoughts?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While rereading some of my old posts recently, I was reminded of <a href="http://scopatz.doesntexist.com/projects/okc/">the Good 'Ole OK Cupid - Walker Project</a>.  For the newer readers, I have a series of fake, passive OKC profiles where I let people message me.  Humor follows.  Check out the link.

So here is an update of the latest batch of hilarious messages that people have sent Jessica (bi/f) and Mark (gay/m).

-------------------------------------------
<b><u>#1 to Jessica:</u></b>
<i>tucson and austin are very much alike cities. i &lt;3 tucson.</i> 

<b><u>#2 to Jessica:</u></b>
<i>I LARP, still do from time to time. Is that too dorky for you?

Your profile didn't really say, so I am wondering what you are looking for right now?</i>

<b><u>#3 to Jessica:</u></b>
<i>hi
nice pic
of you laying down
too bad I can't see your face
whats your name
?</i>

<b><u>#4 to Mark:</u></b>
<i>ha. That pic of you two in black with cowboy hats -- looks like y'all are Siamese twins. Oh well. A man can dream</i>

<b><u>#5 to Mark:</u></b>
<i>i spotted a bear flag and I agree with everyone else's reaction on that adorable mustache.
What's up?  
Hugs</i>

<b><u>#6 to Mark:</u></b>
<i>This Jesse, and I'm deaf mean I cant hear and speaking...SO What do u like 2 with me? You;re so sexy, i just check your picture so sexy and cute! winks!</i>

<b><u>#7 to Mark:</u></b>
<i>hey sexy so what's up with you? do u want to have alittle fun... yeah, i know my profile says straight but i still like to have fun with guys... i just keep it low key! :P</i>

<b><u>#8 to Mark:</u></b>
<i>Hi I read your profile and I like what is there. I am new to Texas and I love it here so far. I love to dance and not very good at it, but do it for fun. I would like to find someone to have fun with. You look like that person. I am not that good looking, but am losing weight. check out my profile and let me know what you think.

I am interested in getting to know more about you sexy thing you. I hope that we can get to know more about each other and see where things end up.</i>
<b>Then, Three Months Later</b>
<i>Love your profile and pics. You are soo sexy. Wanna chat?</i>
-------------------------------------------

And once again the litmus test of my life reveals that only gay men covet my assets.

<b>So favorites, everyone?  Post a comment telling the world which one you like the most!  Mine is either #3 or #7.</b>]]></content:encoded>

Real food hates me. Or my GI tract hates real food.  Or something.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I feel like I should make a post, now, at 2 am.  But I also feel that anything I write will be incomplete until the weekend is over.  

So for those of you who don't know, I passed my PhD Proposal Defense on Tuesday.  So other than some coursework, this was literally my last hurdle before I go up to defend the real deal next May! ::crosses fingers::

The experience left me drained more than excited.  But in celebration, I ate some things that I knew would hurt my stomach.  And they did.  However, I resisted buying Newman-O's.  Chocolate is almost entirely out of my diet.  For shame.  I *love* chocolate!

On the other hand, I feel that my private life is moving in the right direction.  ::knock on wood::  Garrick made a comment a while back that went something along the lines of me being "75% recovered".  I took exception to that at the time, but now I think I know what he was driving at.  Hopefully I am closer.  Garrick also has a way of sticking numbers to things which really ain't got no business havin' numbers on 'em.  

So between the PhD drain and the private positives, I feel very manic when I am alone.  Whatever recent experience my mind decides to replay is what emotional state I fall into.  Here's to the next couple of days bringing more good things to focus on for the week ahead!

Goodnight, Austin, Texas where ever you are.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Post that was Promised: A Plethora of Anthonys</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend was pretty stellar.  It could have gone either way, but it actually turned out pretty damn well.  This pleases me.  

The best single quote of the weekend was at the begging.  I was at Guy's Night on Friday which was pretty fun.  Hanging out, watching people get drunk, shootin' the shit, <i>et cetera</i>.  At one point, and there after, the host was babbling on the floor, out of his mind.  A hilarious drunk. 

<b>Anthony (not me):</b> So, man, do you <i>get</i> hangovers?
<b>The Host:</b> Like a Bachelor-and-a-Half!

I nearly died; you just know he has been practicing that line in front of a mirror, completely sober.  Still, the most important part of Guy's Night for me was that I got to be introverted in a very natural and comfortable way.  There was only one point where I stepped down from a conversation that my little Extrovert was screaming out to challenge.  Both banality and evil won the day.

Saturday I took a bike ride down to Town Lake, around Zilker park and back up.  It was one tasty time.  But this brings up the point that I think I am gaining most of my muscle mass right now in my legs.  Which is ok I guess.  But still not quite what I was going for...

Later, I met up with Josh and we went to dinner (Garlic Fries and Arnold Palmer!) and to Star Trek.  I am not really going to comment on the movie, but I will say that I have *only* found one negative review.  <a href="http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html">It appears that George R. R. Martin thinks it kinda blew.</a>  He is wrong; the movie did the one thing that movies of this sort are supposed to do.  It <i>entertained</i> me.  But still it is interesting to hear a dissenting opinion from one of my favorite living authors.  (Doubly strange since his friend Melinda Snodgrass wrote a few Next Generation episodes.)

After I got home from the flick, Anthony (not me, not from Guy's Night) from Houston came into town.  It was like 9:30 and we decided to hit the town.  After some pre-drinks, we walked downtown, became suitably inebriated, went to Katz's, and walked home.  It was really great to see him and get some time to talk with him away from other trappings. 

We talked about a lot of the lameness that has occurred to both of us in the recent past, which needs not be rehashed here.  But we also talked about a lot of the good stuff too.  During this, I explained to him the "Fine Specimen of a Man" conceptual continuity that has driven me for the past few years.   He, like many, took an opposing stance.

But his argument, from how I understand it, was much different than say my mother's.  He was lobbying that my perspective is wrong.  Rather than doing this for myself with possible side benefits to external relationships, that I need not pursue any sort of fine specimen status because it all boils down to "Brand: Me" anyways. How you sell yourself to people is much more important than what you actually are.  I actually agree with him.

But I am terrible at selling myself.  Even to my own PhD committee.  And I am independently-minded.  I want to try to look good and maybe feel healthy because I want to know how it feels first person.  I want this transformation.  I want it for me.  Not for you or the world or to slut around with. 

On Sunday, I did my usual routine and did some work.  But then I went and saw closing night or the "Wheels of Wonderland" show.  I saw opening night as well.  Hilarious again.  It is a bike/carnival/awesome themed interpretation of "Alice in Wonderland".  Luckily, Anthony from HTX made it in time for the show.  So he took some pictures of the show and the cast.

I then offered to help drive this giant snake bicycle back to the <a href="http://www.austinbikezoo.org/">Austin Bike Zoo</a>.  This entailed some loading and unloading but was generally an awesome experience.  But then Anthony wanted to eat and I needed coffee so we crashed their cast party at this Vietnamese place.  

In the end I replaced a Tootsie Roll Pop that I had stolen the weekend before.

Anthony and I went home, played a little DWG2, watched some movies online and crashed.

It was a pretty rock solid few days.  I am appeased.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Not Andrew here. This weekend deserves a post.  However, this is my third attempt.  Maybe I should hire a ghost-writer.  Getting the right blend of serious, awesome, sultry, thoughtful, hilarious is difficult.  I am not that good of a writer.  I can tell you all about possible health effects of the uranium decay chain, but this weekend...  Well you may as well be up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_River_Site">Savannah River</a> without a paddle!

In truth, this should be many posts.  Some of which I know how to write, some I don't, and some I don't yet know even how I feel about.  

Normally, My go-to for un-writeable posts is <a href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/2008/04/27/">slash or fan-fic</a>. I even know what comes next. (Char/Sayla go!)  But given some thoughts running through my mind, I'll leave the incredibly disturbing sex writing to George R. R. Martin.

So maybe, when I am more awake, I will write a series of small and pointed posts.  Or maybe it will just have to wait until after Flipside...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was planning on writing this yesterday, but if you follow my twitter you would know that I completely broke my system while moving to the latest stable kernel release (2.6.28).  This was not without purpose; I needed my computer to function a bit better for work and also I needed to add iPod support since I just bought my brother's used one.  Luckily, <i>mah 1337 h/-\ckz0rz skillz</i> came in handy and the whole process only took me like 6 hours.  It would have been less, but I  only had the broken machine on hand!

So before I go further, Pallas Beltane was amazing.  I really did love it.  It was held at the <a href="http://www.rpcampground.com/">Recreation Plantation</a>, which is moderately in the boonies but has every amenity.  Basically, a 40+ acre facility in the hill country.

The area is zoned into three regions.
<ol><li>Up by the gate there is a light field and some trees and the house where the proprietor live.</li><li>Through a strand of oaks, there are some camp sites and hot showers and it is generally woody.</li><li>This falls off a 14 foot hill down to a field with a couple of pavilions and a pool.  The other border of the field is a creek (which was dry).</li></ol>Naturally, my first thought was <strong>LARP</strong>.  The entire facility was basically made for dressing up (or the alternative) and running around.  The fee to rent the whole place out for the weekend was like $1k.  Well within most RP budgets.

I camped down by the creek with all of the other low-land gorillas.  There wasn't a lot of organized activity, but there did not really need to be either.  All in all, I had a wonderful time.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Continuing, the weekend camp out was chalked full of meeting people, which means that it was full of new emotions and discovering new ways of mixing up my many varied personalities.

Now before you get too many misconceptions, most of these new folk I was skinny dipping in the aforementioned pool with before I ever had a conversation with them.   Which conveniently brings me to my first unexpected experience.

The camp was fairly evenly divided between real adults and those who are just old enough to fake it.  My first serious conversation took place in the pool with Real Adult Paul.  Basically he was squeezing me for information on what I do in graduate school and the like.  So there I was, naked in a pool, explaining fuel cycles and the importance of the distinction between carbon emissions and environmental impact.  Meanwhile, other people were jousting on each other's shoulders.  It was fairly surreal.

Many people seemed to think I was from Florida.  I am assuming that this comes from Ant or someone mis-telling the "You Know Katy" story.

One of these was a girl called Beanie.  Friday night during the revel fire, Beanie and I discovered a shared taste for top-shelf tequila.  Don Julio was our mutual friend, while neither of us talk to Jose anymore.  Good times.  We made a liquor run to satiate our needs.

Around that self-same fire, was my first real opportunity to speak with J. and Katya.  Their relationship with each other is very "<i>Taming of the Shrew</i>."  Moreover, they bring this brand of extrovertedness to others as well.  Here an interesting thing happened.  Normally, I am the Intro-/Extro-vert opposite of those around me.  Likely because I was so comfortable, I stepped up to the plate.  With these two I felt at ease ribbing them as much as they did me (though not quite so much as they taunted each other).  Intriguing. 

Tim and I were awake much later than everyone else (especially those not copulating).  Tim is a Philosopher trained in Physics and Computer Science.  We had a fuck ton to talk about.  Very nice fellow and I think we connected on a level that was unique for me there.

The next day it rained.  It was a cold rain.  This did not stop people, myself included, from running around in it and then hopping in the slightly warmer pool.  After a hot shower, under the pavilion, we played the largest game of Apples to Apples I have ever seen.  

Saturday night at the revel fire, there was a similarly large game of "I've never".  You know the one where everyone puts out their hands and goes around and says "I have never slept with a manatee" or some such.  Then everyone who <i>has</i> slept with a manatee puts down a finger. Etc. Once all of your fingers are down you take a drink and get to ask a targeted question.  Those of you who know me, know that this game is my weakness.  This is, of course, when I got drunk.

However, even with the positive and relaxed atmosphere, I still felt like some of the targeted questions were too pointed.  For instance, I was asked where I fell on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale">Kinsey Scale</a>.  I didn't answer because I didn't think it applied to me.  But even if it did, this is effectively asking someone to out themselves.  Which is always wrong.  

After this tell-all, we warmed ourselves by the fire and then went to bed.  

Obviously there is a lot I am glossing over and much I am not covering at all.  But I think the above relates my emotional and mental state throughout the weekend quite well.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello California!  This one is for you.  If you can read this, consider yourself privileged.

So it might be the case that I am a terrible person.

<u><b>The Story:</b></u>

So remember that girl from Belleville from the previous Pallas posts, Beanie, who I went with to buy some tequila.  Well, this is her Beltane story.  

Basically, over Friday night and Saturday, Beanie and I talked.  A lot.  The more we conversed the more similar we seemed.  There were times where I had to figure out new and exciting ways to say that I felt exactly the same way about any given subject.  

Maybe this started out as, "Don Julio/Patron is made of gold" (or blanco, as the case may be)!  However, it quickly progressed to Coffee, Tea, Politics, Relationships, Personality Types, and other important value systems.  We aligned on a lot of levels.

So we went to get tequila, the good stuff, on Saturday afternoon.  The trip took at least an hour.  During this, we exchanged the important parts of our life stories.  Though I may have grown up a troubled individual, she definitely got the raw end of it.  Her youth reminded me most of Jessie's. Though this is <i>not</i> to say that it was strictly analogous. I immediately empathized nonetheless. 

At the "I've never" game that night, we got drunk on our Don Julio.  Then we went and sat by the bonfire.  Having all warmed up, several of us took off our shirts.  I gave Beanie a massage.  I think I picked up the giving massages to people thing subconsciously from Sal &amp; Friends (tm).  So now I slip into it whenever I am sufficiently tipsy.

Well, this time it worked.  Her tent was destroyed by ants the night before and rain that day.  I offered (utterly selflessly mind you) to continue the massage in the my tent, and let her crash there if she wanted. Once in my tent we ended up cuddling and talking some more.

<i>This is when it came out that she had delayed in telling me about her absent boyfriend for the first day.  I told her that I thought she was swell and that I didn't want to do anything that would endanger her relationship and that I didn't really come prepared to do anything (All True). And that everything was in her hands.  That being said, I did say that I really wanted to make out with her.

<b>And we did.  And I just might be a terrible person.</b></i>

And before anyone asks, her hair is shoulder length...a grown out bob if my skill does not fail me.  I blame Colleen Moore.

<u><b>Why I Might Be A Terrible Person:</b></u>

Before we fooled around, Beanie indicated that she was in some sort of partially open (mostly closed) relationship where her boyfriend wanted to meet the other party first.  So closed.  At least for purposes here.  

Fuck.  In this replay of the Santa Barbara fiasco, I became my nemesis! Damnit, I willingly and knowingly did something that was a violation of someone else's terms.  This makes me an automatic shitty asshole.  I swore up and down that I would never fucking do this.  What the in the god damn hell?

After talking with Meenon, I am convinced that I acted with a lack of integrity.  Not that there is anything I can do about it now.  So from an emotional perspective it doesn't pay to worry about it any more.

Kerry Prime in her infinite pragmatism pointed out a couple of other essential tid bits.  For instance, I understand that blaming just the extraneous boy in these situations devalues the position of the girl.  After all, it takes two to frottage.  Beanie had to want this to happen at least as much as she didn't.  This wasn't me trying to piss off some other guy.  

But now that it is over, Kerry pointed out that I am essentially out of the picture.  What happens in their relationship is their business.  I stay the fuck back.  I am not an equal partner in any of this.  

Which is frankly good advice.  At the time I said I was concerned for her and her relationship.  I didn't want her to emotionally divest from her primary partner into me. But Beanie always countered that she was worried more about me afterwards.  At the time I didn't understand what she meant.  But now I do.  

Kerry also pointed out that what I did isn't technically as bad as what had happened to me.  Effectively I am just some random other penis.  However, when I was the primary partner, I lost my entire support system overnight.

<u><b>What Good Came Of This:</b></u>

I think it is important not to understate the amount of real chemistry that there was between Beanie and I.  Ok so maybe it wasn't quite the drop everything and run off into the sunset with me kind of thing.  But it was probably more than sufficient for the holiday romance that ensued.

She kept saying that she almost never trusts anyone, but for whatever reason she trusted me.  I only trust people as far as I think they trust me.  So repeating this really hit the right spots personally.  I almost never trust anyone, but because of this I trust her.  Under more sceptical circumstances, I would call this some pretty sophisticated flirting.  But I don't doubt the sincerity of it.  Even if she did end up in my tent.

Then there is this whole weird "both of us are serial monogamists" thing.  How the fuck did we end up together, so compromised?  I am purposefully on hiatus; trying to appease friends and family that urge me to do something different.  I even went so far as to sleep with bullshit people to try to get them to go away.  Apparently, that always backfires.  So I resolved to only be with those who I am actually attracted to and hold some affection for.  So I know why I invited her into my tent in the first place, but why she accepted is still sort of a mystery. 

Neither should it be overlooked that it has been three years since anyone has called me sexy, out of a sense of lust.  And for me to find them attractive in return, seems like a pure Godsend.  She said she would have preferred me with a beard.  She even said that my weird back hair patches were hot!

It has been so long since that amazing thrill.  The mental, emotional, and tactile all came together.  Even if it was for just a moment, it is such moments that make life worth living.

I can't believe that I was missing that surge when you kiss someone.  Really kiss them.  Not how one would kiss one's mother.  But in that way that hints "Your Body, tell me more..." No blandness, no marketing, but the essence of physicality.

I think if we had gone any farther than we did, my heart would truly be broken now.  But making out is something I can do with anyone and not feel particularly jealous or invested.  However, this was, for better AND worse, more than just making out.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello World!

Just got back from my very first <a href="http://www.burningflipside.com/">Burning Flipside</a>.  Good golly, Ms Molly!  There was so much pretty, shiny, awesome, tasty, lovely, that once again I can't cover it all in a single post.  Or even in a couple of posts.  Or even bother to write them all in a single day.  Some of this stuff needs to sit and gel for a couple of days.  

So I am going to do what I did for Pallas.  There will be a series of forthcoming Flipside posts each based around a central theme.  I will definitely start with a 'summary of events' post, to set the stage.  Certain posts may be locked based on the sensitivity of the material, so no worries.  I shall give myself until Thursday to pop all of these out.  After that, travel happens and I will be distracted.

Re-culturing myself to Civilization is significantly more difficult than the other way around.  WHY ISN'T EVERYONE NAKED?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let me make this absolutely clear right now: I had an absolutely wonderful, positively positive Burning Flipside experience.  No holes barred! (Though that doesn't mean they got filled...)  

Luckily, I wrote notes every night before going to bed about what had happened that day.  The following is a very brief summary.  Think of this as a bullet point list that sets the stage for future posts.

<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Shs6_BwjDjI/AAAAAAAAA4g/5Uo4BOm8SyM/s400/MisfitsCamp04.JPG" />

<u><b>Thursday:</b></u>

Drove out to near Pedernales with my top down and the car full of camping gear.  Once at Flipside, I was greeted with the token lovely "Welcome Home."  While I was surveying the area, Ratha and Tom drove up.  We zoned our camp site.  While setting up my tent, I helped them set up Ratha's fan-fucking-tasty Yurt [shown above].  After the shade structure was up, <b>Misfits Camp</b> was born!

After lunch I put on a pirate costume and raided <b>Sparkedelica</b>, where most of the other people I knew coming in were camped.  Once there, I took off the ridiculously hot leather jerkin and was wandering around in my flow-ey pants.  A 72 yro man named Douglas (Burn name: Eternity) wandered into the Sparkadelica lounge in the heat of the day.  He and I ended up doing <i>Acrobatic Yoga</i>  [shown below].

Went and had dinner with the Misfits. From the heat and not having eaten a lot that day, I managed to get drunk on two glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon at 8:30 in the evening.  Yikes!  I walked Ratha partially to her volunteer greeter shift. Saw Leigh and Sunshine on the way and they led me to Sparkadelica.  Once there, I announced, "Hello Sparkadelica, I'm Drunk!"

I spent the next couple of hours dancing off my buzz in the laser show in the Sparkadelica lounge.  Completely sober, Georgia-based Lauren and Rowan and I went down to look at the creek at night.  I heckled people the whole way.  Hilarious.  

Wandered around after that and noticed how much awesome sound there was everywhere.  Went to sleep.

<u><b>Friday:</b></u>

Tom and Rathta and I spend the better part of the morning hanging out at the <b>Temple of the Steaming Pot</b>.  Yeah for free coffee!  Also, <b>Obik</b> had some amazing home-made sarsaparilla.

Nakia and Jason (Nakia's friend from Madison) show up.  Jason is as cool as Nakia talked him up to be.  

I bounce around a lot today.  I spend the majority of the afternoon dressed as a Valkyrie learning to spin poi, Awesome.  

It was my night to cook so I made my car camping favourite: Build-Your-Own-Burritos.  I forgot one thing the entire trip, and thus our burritos had no Cholula.  Damn.

I eat more at dinner this night and don't get drunk.  I bounce around a lot at night too.  At one point I meet up with the Sparks at the camp <b>Ish</b>. I give Jayme a piggy back ride out.  

Nakia and Jason and I spend hours talking outside of the Misfits camp.  I go to sleep at like 3 am.

<u><b>Saturday:</b></u>

Today is Martin's (a Misfit) birthday

Assume the Position: I am a good sport and get my tushy paddled at <b>Slap That Ass Camp</b>.

Jason, Tom, and I get coffee in the morning again.  I hang around Misfits until after lunch and they are about to start their pick-up D&amp;D 4th Ed. game.  

I hang up my hammock and let Jayme chill on it and we have a really great conversation.

I wander around and go down to the creek.  There I see a bunch of Sparks in what amounts to a hippie soup and decide not to swim.  I catch Ian from <b>KFLIP</b>, the Flipside Radio station.  We decide to leave the creek area right before the flash flood!

I help KFLIP hold down some of their shade structures during the storm.  Then I rush over to Sparkedelica to help them secure the lounge against the rain.  After the lounge is mostly safe, I head out into the storm in nothing but my breezy pants.

Wet and cold, I make my way back to the driest place in Flipside: Ratha's Yurt!  There a bunch of us take humid shelter and play a game of Munchkin which Ratha wins [shown below].  We then play the most tense game of "Last Night on Earth" with Gallows and Penitent John. 
 
<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Shs7Bho_TzI/AAAAAAAAA48/nu-QWYeUNbQ/s400/YurtRain1.JPG" />

The night is very clear and I am very sober.  I spend the evening with Ratha, Tom, and Jason and we see a rad Tesla coil music performance.  This was also my first climb up the effigy. 

<u><b>Sunday:</b></u>

I help Ratha and Tom pack up and leave.  I hang out with Jason and Nakia most of the day and night.

During the day, we go over to <b>Glam Camp</b> and pick out clothes for later.  

It rains briefly.  I weather it in the hunkered down Sparkedelica lounge.  Afterwards, I help them reassemble for the night's festivities.  

I have dinner with the Misfits + Nakia.  Conversation flows naturally.  I go to the bathroom and return to find that all of my camp mates deserted in the 10 minutes I was gone.  I eventually find some of them.

Assume the Position: I am a good sport and get my tushy paddled at <b>Slap That Ass Camp</b>.  I get a piece of watermelon for my efforts.

Due to a burn-ban, the effigy <i>was not</i> burned.  However, something cooler happened.  They did a spin show in front of it, lit off 500 pounds of fireworks within 20 feet of me, and then I got to help pull the effigy down!  Coolest thing ever!

I wander around with Nakia and Jason but loose them at Ish when I start talking with someone and then fall asleep on their sweet, sound-activated, bench chair things.  I find them again later at the Temple of the Steaming Pot.

We wander up to Sparkedelica and then I go back to Misfits and fall asleep.

<u><b>Monday:</b></u>

Wake up, Pack up, and get outta there.  

Rudely shocked back to reality when a rude man in a Porsche yells at me for walking too slowly in the cross walk on my way to Wheatsville.  I give him a tiny piece of my mind.  Austin is a really great city to live in, but it is still a city.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>[Flipside: 3] Radical X</title>
		<link>http://scopatz.blog.com/2009/05/26/flipside-3-radical-x/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a burn event, Flipside follows out of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man#Principles">some basic principles</a>.  Many of these are similar to the general backpackers' credo.  However, the most interesting of these are the radical ones: Radical Inclusion, Radical Self-Reliance, and Radical Self-Expression.

<u><b>Radical Inclusion:</b></u>

The most self-evident of the three, the idea that anyone can participate does not stop at the door.  While joining a camp can have varying degrees of exclusivity, everywhere is home.  The inclusion principle more than anything else makes the entire event very low pressure.  Become inebriated, or don't.  No worries.  If you don't like what you are experiencing then go somewhere else.  There are pretty, shiny things everywhere!

This, as much as anything, probably serves to explain the staggering number of Jews I met.  At first glance, this would seem odd for an event that effectively rebuilds a Golden Calf (and burns it).

<u><b>Radical Self-Reliance:</b></u>

After Pallas, I understood that I should probably come prepared more for something between backpacking and car camping.  WRONG!  Flipside is about living more luxuriously than car camping, possibly better than you do in your day-to-day life.  Still, this backpacker mentality really sticks with me.  

<u><b>Radical Self-Expression:</b></u>

I am very guarded normally, but I don't think I have ever felt as expressive as at Flipside.  Sean of the Dead and I were having a conversation about how your internal monologue can just come right on out.  Just by saying what you think almost all the time, what you think becomes so much more positive.  

For me this leads to some awesome opportunities.  I can drop in and out of conversations with people I have never met.  When I start my crazy rambling, strangers come in and tell me something even stranger.

One morning while I was cleaning my breakfast plate, some girl walked by wearing purple bikini bottoms, a fuchsia top, and was using a white sash as a canopy to cover her eyes from the sun.  I smiled at her.  She said, haltingly, "I have walked by before and seen you.  You have a sweet face."  I gave her a hug and she walked off.

There is something wonderfully right with the world that this was allowed to happen.  There is something terribly wrong in that it does not happen more often and seems relegated to Flipside.

(TAKE A BREATH)

Other than dressing as a Valkyrie and a Pirate, I did other costuming as well.  For the burn on Sunday, I picked up a reasonably tight fitting red dress from <b>Glam Camp</b>.  To this I added a string of red fairy lights wrapped around my body.  Additionally, I bummed a black mesh kerchief from Jayme which we turned into a choker.  Hawt.  

(SQUEE)

The undercutting theme of the event is to <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=436">try to push and explore your own boundaries while respecting those of everyone around you</a>.  Cross dressing to this level is not something I have done in a long time.  Yet, I can't help feeling I sort of cheated since cross dressing is not *truly* pushing any of my boundaries.  Still, I got more exposure in feminine garb in this dress than ever before.

The wonderful thing about it, was that the outfit itself did most the work of turning me into a sex-object.  (The dress is clearly a sex object on its own, by design.)  I got <i>a ton</i> of comments from both genders. They were spread pretty evenly along the forwardness spectrum.  Here is a sample, in order of increasing intensity:

"<i>Nice Dress.</i>"
"<i>Are you a princess?</i>" (My answer was to strike a pose.)
"<i>I love that color on you.</i>"
"<i>Hey Sexy!</i>",
<i>etc,</i> you see where this is going...

Fuck, can I wear this get up every day?!  I often rail against the fact that men don't get truly sexy clothing in our culture.  Maybe the solution really just is for men to co-opt women's clothing.  It was so fucking nice to be objectified in this fashion.  Certainly it would get old as a 24/7/365 thing (Helloooo, Feminism). But even if this was just for play-play it was super.  Unfortunately, pictures are still forthcoming.

All of the sexual aspects of dress play were neatly counter-balanced by Noah, the 12 yro kid in the neighbouring camp.  A rather effeminate boy himself, he took to school yard teasing in a fit of cosmic irony.  While playing catch with a hacky-sack with him, Noah took to calling me Man-Woman.  This somehow developed into a super-hero/villain tag line. "By day, Man-Woman.  By Night, Still Man-Woman."  It was cute; I laughed.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>[Flipside: 4] Sparka de Misfit</title>
		<link>http://scopatz.blog.com/2009/05/27/flipside-4-sparka-de-misfit/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<u><b>NOTE:</b></u> This is an exploratory post that I am trying to rush out quickly.  I am trying to make it very clear what is happening in my head. I welcome your input and comments.

<u><b>CONFLICT:</b></u> I am in love with two camps and I don't quite know what to do for next year.

Naturally, <b>Sparkadelica</b> is an amazing group of people and I am honored to be even peripherally part of their organization this time out.  Next year, I have been invited to join full on.

As a founding member of the <b>Misfits</b>, I am stunned at how well known we were and what we managed to pull together inside a week.  Next year could surely be even better.

Hmmm what to do?  I have a year to figure this out...

<u><b>ARGUMENTS FOR SPARKADELICA, AGAINST MISFITS:</b></u>  Basically, the Sparks are an awesome set with a lot of love and some superb group art projects that I would have an absolute blast participating in.  The mutant vehicle, balloon temple and sign are all great works that I would enjoy adding my piece to.

Additionally, joining would allow me to sleep up on the Playa and eat the Spakadelica food and generally be more coordinated with this fantastic set of people.

The Misfits, as the name implies, could (though it is unlikely) be significantly less coordinated.  Especially when it comes to communal meals (which I am frankly not big on).

<u><b>ARGUMENTS FOR MISFITS, AGAINST SPARKADELICA:</b></u> Yurts.

Aside from Yurts, I *really* jive with the idea of giving a home to the homeless.  I did not join Sparkadelica because I did not meet the requirements in time.  I fully understand and agree with why Ant made the decisions about Spark exclusivity that he did.  I respect him for sticking to these rules and being very upfront about them.  However, the Misfits are / should be on the opposite of the spectrum with regards to this.  If someone doesn't have a camp, or for whatever reason can't join the camp they want, they should have a place to go.  As long as they aren't an asshole.  <i>Radical Inclusion</i>.

The Misfits were there for me in my time of need, I strongly feel like I should help pass this new tradition down.

The Misfits were also a wonderful, spectacular group of people. We were also more evenly spread out.  The only age group not represented by us this time were children.  And that was probably for the best.

Also, I would not have to sleep up on the Playa if I wasn't with Sparkedleica.  I am sorry, but those generators bothered me a lot.  There was a guy, Stray from <b>Ish</b>, who camped out alone near us, far from his camp.  When he went to try to sleep, he wanted to actually sleep.

Also, I overheard someone in Sparkadelica say that they might be getting to large and may try to limit growth.  But that could just be hearsay.  And Sparkadelica would benefit since their overflow could come down and join us, no questions asked!

<u><b>CURRENT RESOLUTION:</b></u>  Obviously, there is still a lot of time to try to figure it this out and many things may change.  Who knows?

But what I think I am going to try to do at this point is join both camps.  I'll pay dues, attend meetings, help with set-up and tear down for everyone. 

At the end of the day, I would probably put my tent down with Misfits (so I could sleep).  And this sneaky plan is dependent on both camp leads being copacetic with the idea.  However, I feel like it would be a cruel joke to make me choose between two fucking sweet groups of people.  The whole idea is that you should do what ever has a positive impact.  Participating formally with both sets would net me the most.

Such is the problem with having a truly awesome first Flipside experience...

Please, Please, Please, no one take this the wrong way.  Ideas?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello Again California.  I mean this in two regards: 

--I am writing this while on the plane from Austin to Phoenix (and then to Santa Barbara).
--This post is duly locked to just the California crowds, which increasingly seem synonymous with the set of people who get to read my private expose.

The vast majority of my negative Flipside experiences were in regards to the women-folk who I am or was interested in.  I went to Flipside with the expectation that I would meet a bunch of new, cool people and that I would do something more than flirt with a couple of them.  For instance, some of the days I was so sore that I would have sold my first-born for a massage, which I never got.  Naturally, I didn't make out with anyone either, which likely condemns me to 3 more months of celibacy.  

Needless to say, I am a bit disappointed.  Part of this is probably that Flipside is this sort of event.  Most people come and go as a group.  And then, doing a hard sell on how awesome you are is not really tolerated.  If you have something amazing to show, bring it to the table.  

The situation is definitely skewed against boys, as Jason and I found out.  This is doubly odd as there is a healthy excess margin of women over men at this burn event.  One would think that having less available men than women (and and even proportion of homosexuals) would make boys a slightly more desired commodity.  But no.  The polar opposite.  The female advantage that exists in the real world was accentuated here.  (Which was part of why putting on the dress was a smart idea.)

But all is not lost, right?!  I came with not one, but two groups!  Surely someone out of the 50 odd people I knew going in must have a level of mutual attraction with me.  And having this level, it could be raised a bit by the burn event.

About half of my 6 or so bad experiences at Flipside were a result of awkwardness and negative vibes around Leigh from <b>Sparkadelica</b>.  Leigh is the cool performance artist whose lollipop I drunkenly stole a couple of weeks ago.  She seemed to flip-flop between talking to me nicely and being so curt that I thought she was dropping me like a bad habit, cold turkey. 

So I don't know if I insulted her at some point, or came on too strongly before, or what.  I feel really bad if I did.  But neither do I know what to do about it.  She simply does not seem interested in communicating with me.  Which is weird because I get along marvelously with her older sister and younger brother.  I am using her as solid evidence for why I shouldn't date straight and narrow girls.

Pretty much everyone else in Sparkadelica was attached.  However, I am likely a member of <b>Misfits</b> in the first place because I met Ratha, builder of Yurts.  We were at the big construction project assembly a week and a half before and I decided to talk to her because I thought she was hot.

It is hard to pin down what she is thinking because she is the only other person I have flagged as flipping between Introvert and Extrovert as easily and often as I do.  Unlike me though, she is default Introvert (I am default Extrovert) and neither does she seem to control it in the same way I do [not confirmed].

I have a hard time judging whether she is interested in me or thinks of me as some cute, dumb kid.  Ratha is a 8 years my senior, a point-of-fact I did not learn until the second day of Flipside.  I'd swear she's 26 on looks alone.

We flirt.  And not in the playful way that I flirt with people who I never want to be in bed with (like 95% of my male friends).   Rather more in that subtle way that you flirt with people who you are actually interested in, but want to test the waters with soundly first.  Ratha: "That girl was right when she said you had a sweet face."  Or she'll smile coyly when I refer to the problems with my sex life being similar to that of a male Praying Mantis.

But then when push comes to shove, no soap.  She and her brother Tom left a day early.  This was partially because Ratha did not feel well on the first day.  However, it was more, from my understanding, because Tom had his fill and wanted to go home.

In any event, I told Ratha that if she wanted to stay for the last night that she could crash in my tent and that Tom could drive their truck back.  She didn't take me up on this offer.  There are a lot of variables here, so maybe I shouldn't take this as a sign that she isn't necessarily interested.  But if she had come, that would have been a clearer indication that she <i>was</i> interested.  And maybe I would have actually gotten a much needed massage out of the deal.  

There were other people from other camps as well, but none panned out either.  Specifically, there were a couple of girls from <b>Ish</b> who I danced with on different nights, separately, at different places.  The come-and-go-with-your-camp phenomenon was what killed anything from happening in spite of the beginnings of a connection.

<b><i>(Alright, time to take another breath and change tracks.)</i></b>

So you, California, obviously remember Beanie.  The girl I wrote you about who I made out with in my tent the week before Flipside, at Pallas Beltane.  Here is an update.

Beanie ended up coming to my Flipside Retox party last night, even though she was not actually at Flipside.  Moreover, she brought me to the airport today.  But about an hour before she was supposed to pick me up, I ran over to Toy Joy to get some luggage tags.  Of course I ended up spending $20 on the <i>Hello Kitty</i> ones, but whatever.  Beanie was killing time in Toy Joy so I poked her and we decided to leave a bit early and pick up some lunch.  

I am really glad that she still wants to be my friend.  And as it happens her relationship with her boyfriend, Eric, has survived.  Which is good.  However, it was not undamaged by our experience.  Which is bad.  It sounds like they have worked through a lot of it and me being away for the summer can only be good on that front.

But I did tell her what we had worked out in the last post on this topic.  (Basically, that I was temporarily worse for the wear from the experience but that it probably was a net positive on my part, on the assumption that I didn't destroy her relationship.)  I tried to reassure her that I take her lead in this matter.  But neither does she bear all of the responsibility in this situation.  I crossed a line that I shouldn't have crossed.  I was being selfish. AND HOLY CRAP IS THE PLANE BUMPY RIGHT NOW!!!

I feel like my part in this has reached some sort of resolution.  But I am deeply sorry that I have caused her and Eric strife.  Which still might make me a terrible person...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello All, I have made it safe and sound to Santa Barbara/Santa Ynez! I know I promised not to write anymore about Flipside, but there are a couple of quick things that need addressing and then I may make a post about Religion later.  Stay tuned.

<b><u>Retox:</u></b>

Thanks to everyone who made it to <a href="http://www.pingg.com/rsvp/p55d3vfakdizi83zw">my Flipside Retox Party!</a>  It was a very relaxed and pleasant experience. <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6446649.html">It was probably a good thing that we didn't go downtown</a>. 

If you couldn't make it out, then next year.  And maybe I won't host it on a Thursday nor run out of Vodka.

<b><u>Pictures:</u></b>

In addition to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Flipside09#">my lame Flipside pictures</a>, I want to give a  big shout out to !  He has posted some of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/molachai/sets/72157618938643650/">his Flipside pictures.</a>

And since this is my personal blog, here are some of my favorite pictures that he took of me.  We'll start with one of the Acrobatic Yoga / Pirate Outfit ones.

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3659/3574311755_7cb06948bf.jpg" />

And then we'll move on to the Valkyrie playing with spin sticks. (Now on Facebook!)

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3610/3575212430_09c41f835c.jpg" />

But really, Flipside is a matching Hat and Sarong affair.

		<title>State: On The Edge</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, here we are at the first post of the summer.  In truth this post should have happened many days ago.  Normally, I post a lot more when I am travelling because of the random periods of downtime which give me an opportunity to blather on.  But in my backlog of email, folks have been asking me how my trip is going.  Here is my response.

California is a mess.  You hear about how the State is in a bad way from the media, but any sceptic looking in would be hard pressed to believe that the situation is as doom and gloom as CNN claims.  The tension here is palpable.  Everyone is jittery, on edge.  It was difficult for me to believe that this was the case even in lackadaisical places like Santa Barbara until I visited.  Never mind Los Angeles or Irvine.  And all reports say that the Bay Area is worse off.  

You can blame it on the Economy (with the big 'E').  But this has transmigrated to something else, I tell ya!  This is a communal, regional, global mental hypertension.  Paranoia.  A psychological disability that spans the Pacific coast.  

Normally, going west from Texas is always a relief.  Running away from school, even with the electronic leash that I write this on, is perpetually gratifying.  Not this time.  

Don't get me wrong, leaving Austin is <b>always</b> hard. Yet going back to the closest thing I have to a home has in the past made it somehow alright.  But now I feel somewhat disconnected from the Southern California experience.  The party is over, the lights came back on, and I just arrived. 

All that said, it has been wonderful to see my friends and marvellous to spend time with my family.  

I went to my favourite crepe place in Santa Barbara after I landed with my parents, Grandmother, and psuedo-grandfather.  My psuedo-cousin from Morgan Hill, Garrick, came down later and visited me last Friday and then I saw the majority of his family at a Wedding Reception the next day.  It made the whole transition very pleasant.

Sunday, I popped down to Beverly Hills to visit Shawn and his girlfriend Mal.  We went to a couple of parks and walked a lot. They are both prepping for Graduate/Law school and seemed fairly stressed.  Overall the transition will be good for them and I think they are excited.  Shawn and I got some good face time later that night.

Monday through Thursday I was hanging out with my Mom in Santa Ynez, with side trips to Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez.  I still don't leave the house much when I am in Santa Ynez; some things never change.

By Friday, how stressed out everyone around me was finally got to me.  I broke.  In front of my Mom, which she didn't really deserve.  I apologized.  I ran down to Santa Barbara quickly and had dinner with my cousin Aaron.  From there I went to my Grandmother.

My Grandmother is currently on a vacation to New York so I drove her to her sister's place in Manhattan Beach, where she was leaving from the next day.  At 10:30 pm Friday night, I finally made it to Irvine.  Rew, Twin, Jessica and I went out to dinner.  I love these people!

Saturday my cousin, Jessica and I met up with Jessica's friends in Pasadena for a hike.  The hike was pleasant.  We went to a waterfall and I hiked up to the top.  However, a variety of other experiences (including uncooked food at a restaurant) marred the overall trip for me.

Today I went to Sunday Brunch with my brother Shane and two of his friends at a Texas-themed outfit in Newport Beach.  He seemed stressed for a variety of reasons.  It is his finals week, so this is understandable.  

There was one incident this week the genuinely pissed me off though.  Last Saturday, Sean fell 125 ft off of a waterfall cliff.  Luckily, he is ok and miraculously managed to not break anything and last I heard was recovering fine.  However, I didn't hear about this until Wednesday night, when I emailed him about backpacking.  

What?!  In fact no one in my family heard.  Sean is my brother; I would have been up there in a heart beat.  I was three and a half hours away.  I feel like I should be on the short list of people who get called first.  Someone, somewhere should have gotten the word to me.  I even talked to our mutual friends in the interim and they didn't even mention it in passing.

So in summary, this trip has been fairly manic.  The state and everyone in it, myself included, seem to be having drastic mood swings.  I am really happy to see everyone, but less enthused that they are so perturbed otherwise.  California might be becoming cheap enough to live in at the cost of not being liveable.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shit! It has been a week!  I really am not getting to write as often as I need to.  Such brief solace, my tabula rasa overfloweth.  

I am not going to ramble on about what I have done in the past week.  The following few statements will have to suffice.  I went to Irvine and saw many people I love deeply, but sadly missed others.  My father left for a business trip to Japan, placing me in an all-awkward, semi-parental role.  My maternal units have had a rough shake this time.  Naturally, I feel behind with all of this going on.

<img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Si781-4cmYI/AAAAAAAAA9s/ovdZim77hBs/s400/CA1.jpg" />

The above is a picture from the car on a recent trip to Santa Maria with my mom.  It has really only been that nice weather-wise three or four days since I have been here.  Sad that the sunny and wonderful is now the climatological exception.  I am certain that this is getting me down.

In LA, with Meenon, I went to see this hip show called "<i>Gaps in the Fossil Record</i>".  It was about a 65 yro Palaeontology professor who falls in love with, marries, and impregnates his 21 yro student.  The show begins when the newly weds move in with her mom, who is naturally closer to the good doctor's age than her daughter.  Complete with a post-apocalyptic twist at the end, the show was amazing.

It was one of those only-in-LA kind of experiences.  The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504762/">playwright</a> for this work in progress has acted in such films as "<i>The Mask of Zorro</i>" and "<i>Gods and Generals</i>".  The mother figure was played <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0153108/">Nancy Charles</a>, who has been in everything.  It was top-notch and I am always happy when Meenon takes me to these neat things.

Additionally, my brother Shane was in a No on Prop. 8 dance theatre production this last quarter called "<i>Everyone Deserves A Happy Ending</i>." He plays the movie star guy, one of the two male leads.  It is about 15 minutes long.  It is in two-parts on YouTube (below).





So please watch it if you can.  As you can see, they mix a lot of dance types in one piece.  I find the jurisprudence tap-battle genius.  If I dare say it, the other male lead (Eli) played his role with a hit of Buster Keaton.  And on a personal note, it is deeply satisfying to be able to truly tease my little brother about the fist time he kissed a boy there being lights, music playing, an audience clapping for him, confetti in the air, <i>et cetra</i>.  I am very proud of him.

A large part of my time in Irvine was spent with my cousin Andrew.  One of the things he introduced me to this time out was the HBO show, "<i>Rome</i>".  Rome is ridiculously good.  However, the spice that kicks it out of the water is certainly <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1203457/">Lyndsey Marshal</a> as Cleopatra.  

I don't know how to express how I feel about her / this role / that time.  Perfection falls somehow short.  So I'll let dear ol' coz do it for me.  <b><u>He called me a "Fucking Fetishist".</u></b>  And if that isn't the most exalted redundant phase in English, I'd like to hear the other contenders.  

And then yesterday, I was listening to an episode of the Savage Lovecast (ep 138) where he was talking about the true versus ironic usage of the word 'fetish'.  Thus spake Merriam-Webster:

"<b><i>An object or bodily part whose real or fantasised presence is psychologically necessary for sexual gratification and that is an object of fixation to the extent that it may interfere with complete sexual expression.</i></b>"

Damn it!  I guess they are right... I always sort of prided myself on having a tertiary openness to other types.  But the jig is up!  Maybe I should drop the mask and try to confront my desires more head on. Thoughts?

If you want to know what my fetish object is, Lyndsey Marshal as the opium-addicted Cleopatra in the 7th episode of 'Rome' is a genuine specimen.  This is not to say that Lyndsey Marshal herself is a necessary component for my sexual gratification.  I am a fucking fetishist, not a fucking creep.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On A Totally Unrelated State Street</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I realize that an <i>Avenue Q</i> and <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> mashup might have limited appeal, but here it is nonetheless.



<b>On a totally unrelated note,</b> I finally got my pair of <a href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_KSO_f.cfm">Vibram Five Fingers KSO!</a>  Naturally, my feet are too small and I am forced to buy the women's...

<b>On a totally unrelated note,</b> I went to the Book Den and found and purchased "<i><a href="http://sacred-texts.com/lgbt/itp/index.htm">Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk</a></i>", <i>circa</i> 1914.  'Primitive Folk' has a fairly obvious meaning.  'Intermediate Types', however, is early 20th century parlance for transvestites, transsexuals, hermaphrodites, and anyone else who doesn't fit into the gender binary.  Now mind you, criticisms abound.  But this book is h.a.w.t. HOT!

<b>On a totally unrelated note,</b> I went to the Book Den and found and purchased a 1907 partially-illustrated copy of the Nibelungenlied.  Or for those unfamiliar with German epic, the mythological retelling upon which Wagner based his famous Ring cycle.  

<b>On a totally unrelated note,</b> my father got back from a business trip to Japan today and brought me a Gundam action figure! Thanks Pops!

<b>On a totally unrelated note,</b> for broader appeal, Weird Al has released his best music video in years: a Doors-esque cometary on Craigslist.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So maybe the title of this post should really be "Physics! ...", because due to thermal lag, meteorologically, we are six weeks behind.  Which really would make the solstice the midpoint of the colloquial calendar.  But if you want to go by the best clock there is, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasons#Astronomical">seasons are delimited by the solstices and equinoxes</a>.

But the Earth being at a certain point in its orbit around the Sun seems as good a reason to celebrate as any.  So no worries!  Apparently, there are six seasons in India...Damn you Wikipedia for being so damned informative...

...Though, through the usefulness of English, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer">Midsummer</a> also refers to this same general time.  Especially, if in regards to a religious context.  So maybe the title here is a bit presumptuous.  

In any event, the real reason I am posting this is that I have <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Solstice#">some pictures from the Solstice Parade (Full Gallery)</a> in Santa Barbara.

Naturally, some people gave me ideas for next years Flipside.  Like this crowd wearing giant Tetris pieces...

Or the girl doing a suspension act inside of a giant balloon float...

<img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sj7IVgBb_XI/AAAAAAAABDI/iPgm_ImcN7k/s400/p6200062.jpg" />

And, we'd be remiss here without the locals on jumping stilts...

But at the end of the day, it all comes down to how chill you are with your family.

I know it has been a while.  But <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/BackpackingCombined2009#">here</a> are the pictures from my backpacking extravaganza.  The photos have captions and follow a story.  

Or you can just watch the <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/BackpackingCombined2009#slideshow/">slideshow</a> directly.

Either way, I hope to post about some of the things that cannot be expressed by pictures about this trip before I leave Raleigh on Wednesday.  

And yes, I am now in North Carolina.  I think the month I just spent in California killed any hope for my budding southern accent... Ahh well...]]></content:encoded>

		<title>[Seqouia: Day One] Yearly Backpacking Trip</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So it has now been a few weeks, I suppose, since I went backpacking with my brother Shane in Sequoia.  But if it is any indication of how hectic my life has been recently, I am just sitting down to write the post about it.

The long and the short of the trip was that since we took our parents van we couldn't make it to Mineral King, a very steep and remote part of the park.  However, there were still some trails that lead off from Giant Forest that we had yet to do.  Specifically, The High Sierra Trail.  

The High Sierra Trail has a pretty interesting history itself.  It is essentially a quite long, well established cut-off trails.  It was meant as a quick way to give access to longer and more imposing back country romps like the Pacific Crest Trail and the John Muir Trail.  Starting from Crescent Meadow in Giant Forest, the High Sierra Trail takes you 60 miles up and down to the peak of Mt. Whitney (the highest peak in the continental US).  

That is not what we did.  Hiking clear east across the park and up Mt. Whitney was not the plan this time out.  However, we did end up walking a couple of days down this way and used the High Sierra Trail to cross the Great Western Divide the first time.  But the really strange thing about the High Sierra Trail was that it was both very busy.  And in spite of this traffic, everyone on it was a little off, if not downright nuts.

<b><u>Day 1:</u></b>  We pretty much walk into this bear on our first mile out.  I have been close to bears before but never like that.  Shane is the one who has to tell me that there was a bear ten feet in front of me on the trail, if only I would bother to look up.  We stand there and look at each other, us and the bear, for a moment.  Shane and I make ourselves big, wait, and then take a step towards it.  The bear scuttles off.  It was pretty comical.

<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SkvxpDEpvTI/AAAAAAAABZs/TgeIKyEtk5s/s400/p6260001.jpg" />

It did not take us long for us to meet a certain older couple for the first time.  She was lithe and ladylike.  He had a classic seventies 'stash.  We nick named them the 'Tortoises' to our 'Hares'.   We would pass them, take an extended break.  They would chug along and pass us.  We would sleep in, only to find them ahead of us on the trail again!  This scenario played out five times in various ways over the course of two days.

Later that day while eating lunch in the middle of the trail, a mule train came upon us.  While we are moving out of the way, the leader (who was decked out in full, real cowboy attire) made small talk with us.  He asked what we were eating.  We responded, "Ummmmm peanut butter and jelly on a tortilla."  The esteemed gentleman's uninterrupted response was "Nothin' Better!"

When we made it to Bearpaw Meadow, the family in the camp next to us strongly hinted that we were not welcome there.  Not wanting to be part of any club that had such jerks as members, we took the easy road and left.

And now I am tired in real life...I'll try getting the rest out soon!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>[Sequoia: Days Two - Five] More Crazies, Fewer Bears</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whooo Ok.  Let's finish this off here.

<b><u>Day 2:</u></b>  Believe it or not, the second day was when the pucky really hit the fan.  Shane and I slept soundly the night before so we got sort of a late start.  We saw the Tortoises a couple of more times on our way up to Hamilton Lake.  It was another couple of thousand feet up over a short and steep trail.  Serene and clam, the lake provided our lunch time spot at about 1 pm.  

With plenty of daylight left to us, I posed the question to Shane on whether to press on to Precipice Lake or to stay at Hamilton for the night.  Shane wisely lead us up and away.

If the hike to Hamilton was steep, the one to Precipice was worse.  Notice a trend?  On the way we come across a couple of guys making their decent.  Apparently, they were trying to go from Giant Forest to Mt. Whitney in a mere 5 days.  This leg of the hike was too much for them and so they decided to turn back and do some other route with their time.  This was our first sign.  Oddly one of the men knew about Eric Schwartz, whose t-shirt Shane was wearing.

Further up this leg, we meet a couple of other guys, also on their way down.  We tell them that we are going to stay the night at Precipice.  They tell us that there is snow there.  We say "Great, we'd love to cool off!"  They inform us that it would be well worth the 45 minutes to push over Kaweah Gap that night.  We thank them and continue on.  This was our second sign.

We loose the trail several times on our way up to the lake because of vast snow cover.  This was our third sign.  But we make it to Precipice and this is what we see...
<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SlI09zytf1I/AAAAAAAABow/YGPiw9CwsMs/s400/023_PrecipiceFrozen%5BAnthony%5D.jpg" />
So Shane gets the question again!

"Do we press on or do we turn back and go to Hamilton?"  It is 5:30 pm.  Light is no longer a luxury.  We need to make for a place to camp.  Not wanting to backtrack after this ordeal, Shane orders the push over the gap!

The trail has been converted into a stream for most of the rest of the short and flat jaunt to Kaweah Gap.  But hiking down the other side of the gap into the Big Arroyo Valley was easily the most dangerous and difficult part of the trip.  

After taking in the sweeping vista for a few minutes, we decide that we need to make it to the valley floor and the trail (which we think we can see in the distance) before dark.  Unfortunately, the trail is snowed out even worse on this side!  The parts of the trail that we can't find are now measured in quarters of a mile, and not yards.  We don't know where we are going and we can't see how to get there.  <b>In a word: Lost.</b>

'Down' is the best, chilly, dusky guess we can muster.  But the hillside is steep and snowy.  And where it is not snow-covered, it is rocky and rugged.  It does not take us long to arrive at an impasse that we can't simply walk down.  I think for a moment.  I look around again.  Then I remember a part in "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VQewd9LDbzgC&amp;dq=desert+solitaire&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1ytqSqqRO8aStgfFxsC6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4">Desert Solitaire</a>" where Edward Abbey, being too lazy to walk down a snowy mountain he had climbed, decided that it was much easier to slide down a snow drift.

Ding! Off go our packs and shoved in front of us, they lead us down 60 feet that we could not have walked down, to the next ledge.  Thanks Eddie-Baby, that trick worked...once.  The next impassable portion was too steep even for that to be vaguely safe.  

Here, there is a place in the rock that Shane and I can climb down and only have to jump around 5 feet to make it.  However, there was no way for us to have our packs on and live.  We considered lowering them down on ropes, but even that seemed risky.  But! If we had good aim, we might be able to throw them to the next ledge down.  Tricky business since the ledge we wanted to hit gave us less than a foot for margin of error with the width of our packs.  

I asked Shane, "Is everything secured?" For each pack, Shane grabbed the top of the pack and I the bottom.  One, two, three, and off they went!  Amazingly they both made their mark!  Mine almost went over the far edge, but thankfully did not.  

"Shit!", I yelled as I remembered that my camera was still attached to the <i>outside</i> of the backpack and probably took the brunt of the fall.  Apparently, my brother safely secured his inside his attic... Even though I felt like an idiot, my camera ended up being fine (Wheeew).

We make it to the warmer valley floor and find the trail.  We hike for an hour before making camp by the mosquito-infested river.  Fuckin' day two, I swear.

<b><u>Day 3:</u></b>  We find ourselves today in a high mountain valley, on the wrong side of the Great Western Divide.  We had crossed it the day before at Kaweah gap.  We  hike downriver, crossing several rivers and streams, until we turn off and up to the Little Five Lakes.  We make good time and stop for lunch at about noon.

The next part of the trip takes us over Blackrock Pass, the next-southernmost crossing of the Great Western Divide.  At this point one might consider us bored by words like 'snow' and 'rock'.  Or barring that experts at traversing them.  No.

Blackrock Pass offered new and exciting ways to loose the trail.  On the way up, the trail was out as often as it was in.  I'd often scramble up over rocks to get an elevated perspective on where the trail re-emerged.  I'd shout out the information back down to Shane, who was not so dumb as to hop over anything with a full pack on.  Finally, we see Blackrock itself.  And between it and us is the largest snow field I have ever seen in June.  What must have been at least 400 yards across, it hid the trail and thus any idea of where we were actually going.  

Brief patches of trail-like land appeared for 10 feet or so before disappearing back into snowy anonymity.  However, most of the snow is below a certain elevation, like salt collecting in the bottom of a bowl.  Unfortunately, once we make it beyond the vast snow, we have the side of the bowl to deal with.

I know I have used the word steep previously.  That was a misuse.  Making it to the top of Blackrock Pass was steep.  Angles of 75+ degrees, hands-and-knees on jagged rocks steep.  Somewhere between this, ~65 lbs on his back, and an elevation of close to 12,000 feet, Shane started complaining that he wasn't feeling well.

Crap.  We *have* to get over this thing! Tonight!  I give him the pep talk about no trail being hard if you are willing to spend the proper amount of time on it.  We take frequent breaks.  At long last we make it.  It is very very windy at the top.
<img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SlI1bcmgbNI/AAAAAAAABs4/HZx4GO7Vdfc/s400/050_ShaneAway%5BAnthony%5D.jpg" />
Worth every gust.

That night we hike down to the Kaweah Middle Fork Valley giddy at our accomplishment. Oh, and the ability to walk downhill.  We make camp at Pinto Lake and Shane sets up the hammock.  

<b><u>Day 4:</u></b>  Mosquitoes drove us fast and early that morning and we make excellent time: 7 miles before lunch at Redwood Meadow.  There we meet a creepy guy who wanted to show us a 'special mushroom' that he thinks he can find again...  We declined in feigned interest of feeding ourselves.

Our goal is to make it to the foothills, camp, wake up the next morning and go to Buckeye Flats and hitch a ride back to our car.  Nature had other plans.  

While in the middle of a creek, it starts to rain, lightning, and thunder.   This is the backpacking equivalent of being caught with your pants down and your junk in a melon or any vegetable halfway up your cootter-hole.  We get the fuck out of that creek.

We throw our rain gear on and take a sweaty run farther down the mountain to where it is no longer raining.  Between the great time we made that morning and being recently propelled by weather, we make for Buckeye Flats that night.

Somehow, near dark, we do end up getting there and finding a camp-site.  We had walked 23+ miles that day.  In the last 28 hours we had gone from an elevation of 12,000 feet to a mere 3,000 or so.  Our bodies were spent.  Food and sleep were the only conceivable things.

Notice how Asian tourists doing Karaoke by the fire at the camp next door wasn't on that list?  They didn't!

Also, recall the calm and professional way we handled that bear from Day One? Yeah, no one at the camp site was there for that, so they all freaked the hell out.  

It really is amazing what will keep you awake when you are that tired!

<b><u>Day 5</u></b>The next morning which hitched a ride back to our car, as planned.  We went to Three Rivers, took a shower and then drove back to Santa Ynez.  

As Shane said to me at one point, "I don't think I like pain as you."  This trip was incredible!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Alright folks, I rarely proselytize.  So that should note to you that this is important.<br /><br />In event that you don't know, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_people">Tamil people</a> are the ethnic minority in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils">Sri Lanka</a>.  The history of the Tamil's shows striking parallels to that of my own people.  I don't have the space here to go into full, comparative detail.  So let's start with modern history then.<br /><br />Most people in the United States are keenly aware of the strife that British Empire introduced to the Middle East with their policy of Partition for Israel/Palestine in 1948.  To a lesser extent, we understand that our chums across the pond created huge problems for the world when they partitioned India from Pakistan at the same time.  What is not well known here is that at the same time that India and Pakistan were split, Sri Lanka was made into a separate sovereignty.  <br /><br />Stemming from the independence came many problems.  Mired in history that I am not covering here, Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority have been effectively at war since 1948.  From such a prolonged conflict has come many unsavoury types and deeds on both sides.  I am not here to argue who was worse when.  I am here to sue for pluralism.<br /><br />In a recent push, the Sinhalese-majority government declawed the Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam, the Tamil's former military establishment.  However, it appears that this has been just the first step in a larger attempt on genocide on the Sri Lankan Tamils.<br /><br />I bring this up now on the urging of one of my friends and her mother.  They are Tamil living in diaspora. Specifically, they requested for me to bring to the attention of my friends and relations a recent condemnation of the Sri Lankan government made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a>, the famous holocaust survivor and author.  <br /><div style="margin-left: 40px"><p><a href="http://www.eliewieselfoundation.org/inthenews.aspx"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">TAMIL PEOPLE STATEMENT:</font></a></p>   <p>Wherever minorities are being persecuted we must raise our voices to protest.&nbsp; According to reliable sources, the Tamil people are being disenfranchised and victimized by the Sri Lanka authorities.&nbsp; This injustice must stop.&nbsp; The Tamil people must be allowed to live in peace and flourish in their homeland.</p>   <p align="right">- Elie Wiesel, June 30th 2009</p></div>Please, if there is any news outlet, religious organization, or the like that you could forward this statement onto, I know it would be appreciated.&nbsp; Help send the message that this sort of inhuman behaviour will not be tolerated in the 21st century.&nbsp; You have my personal gratitude.<br /><br />]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like with so many things in my life recently, my review of this year's silent film festival has been backlogged for a couple of weeks.  But here it is, finally, in an attempt to get it out of my To-Do list.

The <a href="http://www.silentfilm.org/">San Francisco Silent Film Festival</a> this year was spectacular.  In my brief three day visit to the city, I managed to see four films.

<b><u><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017918/">The Gaucho</a> (1927):</u></b>  Aside from being my <i>alma matter's</i> mascot, gauchos are the Argentine version of the more northern cowboy.  I knew that I wanted to see this film the moment saw it listed for the festival.  'Douglas Fairbanks' is a name that means less than it should outside of the silent film crowd. Thankfully, Dougy-Baby didn't fail to deliver.

The basic plot goes as follows.  Girl master thief (Lupe Velez) meets boy master thief (the Gaucho, Douglas Fairbanks) and they fall in love.  In their raiding of small town antics, they get roped into saving a small mountain shrine (the City of the Miracle) from a recent coup's dictator whose lackeys were shaking the Church down from money.  Apparently, the plot occurred to Mr Fairbanks while visiting a similar shrine in the French countryside.

Douglas Fairbanks aerobics were impressive as always.  Watching the man vault up and down buildings, on and off moving horses never seems to get old.  But the truly shocking thing to me was his mastery of the bola.  The bola is a weapon that is notoriously hard to learn.  To master it takes practice from early childhood.  However, Fairbanks performs difficult tricks with smooth ease.  He even incorporates their usage into a dance!

Nor should the utter competence of the leading lady be overlooked.  Lupe Velez was effectively the equal of her male counterpart.  The most memorable moment for me of her was when she was locked up in a room.  The key was stuck in the door on the other side.  She pushed a rug underneath the door, used a pin to push the key out of the lock, the key fell onto the rug, she dragged the rug buck under the door, used the key to unlock the door, and walked out of the room.  It was brilliant.

To overcome the dictators army currently garrisoned at the shrine, the Gaucho causes a stampede of thousands of cattle and ushers them into the city.  This gives one of the most stunning shots of the film.  When the cattle first get to the city walls, they cram up against them until their sheer mass breaks down brink and mortar.  Then  a flood of cow-flesh pours over the wall.  When I am old and grey, that is an image that I will remember when I have forgotten all else.  This movie was fantastic!

<b><u><a href="http://www.dianying.com/en/title/ymg1932">Wild Rose</a> (1932):</u></b>  I have trouble finding good things to say about this movie.  Not that it was bad, per se.  I think fundamentally when I sit down to see a movie, I want to be entertained.  This is probably a broader category for me than it is for most people; if I am challenged or forced to think, I am entertained.

That said Wild Rose wasn't entertaining.  It is supposed to be this big paradigm shifting film for Chinese cinema.  The director, Sun Yu, had just returned from the United States (having learned cinematography) and made this film.  So maybe Yu's Chinese audience had never seen something like this movie before.  However, I swear I had seen some of his shots in earlier films by Vertov and Chaplin and others.  What was special was who made it and who was watching it at the time, not the film itself.  The plot was OK, but overloaded with nationalist sentiment.  I understand that some people really get off on such palpable propaganda, but I can't stomach it.

<b><u><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018526/">Underworld</a> (1927):</u></b>  Easily my favourite film of the festival this year.  It was marginally better than "The Gaucho".  Billed to us as a proto-noir, it was truly the essence of a gangster film.  To get an idea of how excellent this film was, it won the first ever Oscar for best writing.  The plot is roughly about the sordid affair of the manly bank robber, criminal overlord Bull Weed, his girl Feathers, lawyer turned bum turned henchman Rolls Royce, and the usual cast of side character policemen and criminals.  The movie is dark and funny, but never both at the same time.  Rather than trying to describe the movie further, here is a poem I wrote about "Underworld":

<i>I saw a girl named Evelyn yesterday.
She's dead now.
She died in 1975 and there is no going back.
Her skin turned black and white, 
and Feathers were <u>everywhere</u>.
She had a Rolls Royce,
but never rode it.
What did that hour buy you,
you gregarious overgrowth of a man?
Did you polish the hard black body?
Do the ivory dressings now glisten in the night?
Draw a bad hand.
Reshuffle the deck.
The Police are here now
and Feathers are <u>Everywhere!</u>
Her head, 
Evelyn's head, is too big. Was too big.
But maybe I am projecting.
I am no more interested in women than a fancy car.</i>

You really should try and find a way to see this movie.  Without discussing it to much more, Rolls Royce has this excellent line when Feathers first starts flirting with him.  Even though Bull Weed is absent, Rolls legitimately plays hard to get.  

Feathers says something like, "I am not interested in books."  To which Rolls slyly responds, "And I am not interested in women."  

The audience laughed.  But there is an interesting historical point here.  'Woman' used here is a double entendre.  The first meaning is the obvious one, 'woman' as in female human.  The second use is 'woman' as a profession.  So it is this second meaning that has since (thankfully) fallen out of usage.  But I think it is this second one that Rolls really meant.  Unlike Bull Weed, his character was not interested in having an unthinking, sit-there-and-look-pretty partner.

<b><u><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0014646/">Aelita: The Queen of Mars</a> (1924):</u></b>  This was a Soviet Russian science fiction film.  I had seen this one in Austin a few years prior so I didn't bother seeing it again.  I think I even made a post about it back then, but I am having trouble finding it.  In truth, I was a bit disappointed.  This was the first time that the Festival was screening a film I had already seen.

<b><u><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019850/">Erotikon</a> (1929):</u></b>  'Erokikon' was a Czech film discussing 'modern female sexuality'...if you ignore the glaring plot holes.  The story is about a love pentagon.  Basically, it follows this creepy (but handsome) sleaze-ball, the two women who he has seduced, and their husbands.  The plot holes all revolve around the women.  There is NO REASON after the first 20 minutes of the film for the women to ever even speak to the creepy guy again.  But for some reason, they see him and fall head over heels once more.  

The film was pretty good.  The camera work had at least one toe in Avant Garde.  Which of course was awesome.  Virginal sex where the camera is placed on the bed, aimed upwards and pivoted.  Splice in the picture of Mary on the wall looking down on you, and my friends, you have one awesome sex scene.

More than this though, I noticed that my facial features were similar to those of the actors in the movie.  This perturbed me.  They look like me.  I know I have some Czech in me, somewhere.  I have never felt th at I need to find people that I look like.  Skin tone and is Italian, my height is French, hair is German. I don't look Jewish.  But I always figured that I was an amalgam. These Czechs, though, they have my face.  Of course what I really mean is that we share facial bone structure.  This is even more clear and present since I have been recently beardless.  For some reason this bothers me.  They have my face!

Congrats if you made it here!]]></content:encoded>

Ya Raleigh!

Well, maybe not so exuberant as all that.  I have been here a couple of weeks now, and have a couple of weeks left to go.  I am painfully lonely here, in addition to the overworked/undersexed status that usually follows from graduate studies.  Last year when I was here, my friend AJ from high school was also out doing an internship.  At the time I didn't realize what this meant for my mental health.  Normally, I am very good on my own: two sigma better than average.  However, the previous two months of travel, going from seeing nearly everyone I have ever known to nothing was too severe.  It was a train running into a brick wall.

But the trend might be changing; the end is in sight.  To combat said loneliness, and think about something other than nuclear fuel cycle error propagation, I went to an album release party for Raleigh-local group <a href="http://www.myspace.com/birdsofavalon">Birds of Avalon</a>.  I found out about this though my avid blog-watching.

The concert had two opening bands before Birds played.  The first was pretty decent.  The second was some hybrid Indie-Punk, which frankly I was not into at all.  Punk should have some bite, rather than be about your 4th of July weekend.  And Indie-music, well I guess I don't care enough to have an opinion.  

Birds of Avalon, however, were great.  Their material encompassed words like 'Musicality' and 'Thoughtfulness' and 'Presence' and most of all, 'Entertaining'.  Still, only one of their songs was truly spectacular, and they saved it for last.

I go into all of this because the venue was fairly interesting itself.  The Pour House (get it? beer, pour) has an extensive upstairs balcony area that wrapped around two sides of the top of the building.  From here you can look down on the pit and the band.  This upstairs is where it is allowable to smoke.  But the view makes it worth it.  Basically I got an eagle eye view of the drummers for the cost of putting up with a little smoke.  I loved it.  At one point between the bands, this man Robin started talking to me.  Robin, Raleigh born and raised, could tell within 5 minutes (from my accent) that I wasn't local.  Damn.

In other good news, though, my friend Shawn from UCSB is going to visit me next weekend.  He is moving to Maryland for graduate school from LA and I get the benefit of a visit.  Awesome.  And a week after that I am outta here!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night, I was on the phone with my mother trying to explain the problems I was having with my research.  Right now, I am doing uncertainty analysis and I was getting results whose error was seven orders of magnitude greater than the actual data value.  Clearly this is wrong.

So I used the following analogy to get across the problem to my mom:  "It is like thinking you have one M&amp;M, you know, plus or minus 10 million M&amp;Ms."

Mom: "Yikes! That is a lot of variance!"

Me: "Yup...And what I'd really like is one M&amp;M plus or minus half an M&amp;M."

Mom: "So, give or take an 'M'."

I thought it was cute.  I wonder if this is a good way to teach error analysis.  It worked seamlessly here...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to read something, go outside and look at street signs.  If you want to read the best damn thing written this millennium, find and swallow <a href="http://ta-nehisicoates.theatlantic.com/">Ta-Nehisi Coates</a>' "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385527462/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=304485901&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0385520360&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=1DM1Q5ZN57KPCVSF85ZD">The Beautiful Struggle</a>."  It is a fast and dangerous read.

TNC, as he is known online, writes like words don't matter.  His pacing makes prose seem poetry.  He capitalizes nouns that deserve to be capitalized, not just ones that normally get the treatment.  His abject neglect of quotation marks will leave you reeling.  

<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Snplcy3j0gI/AAAAAAAACeU/mVFRBKUBZwk/s400/p7030014.jpg" />

Basically, it is his memoir of growing up in Baltimore and somehow surviving the crack epidemic, AIDS, and his super-human vegan, Vietnam Vet, ex-Panther leader father.  Add on this TNC's status as the awkward, Dice-throwing nerd and you gain an unrivalled perspective.  

I am not going to spoil the book for anyone, because you really must read it yourselves.  But I am going to reflect on some of the basic themes.  He talks a lot about having Knowledge and being a Conscious person.  Concisely, this is the knowledge that you will always be judged by your looks and conscious that your heritage and birthright are the very things that will forever put you in harms way.  But more than this, it is knowing that a better world can be made, built for you and yours.  Maybe not today, maybe not this generation even.  It not an overly hopeful message.  It is knowledge that we were slaves.

TNC's father struggled to teach this to his children.  In spite of their ignorance and apathy, in opposition to their surroundings, to make them into Conscious Individuals.   In many ways this exemplifies the analogies between Blacks and Jews.  

I think every religiously Jewish child grows up Conscious.  If they didn't get the message, there was something wrong with the teachers. Even the strictly culturally Jewish have a budding awareness of Knowledge.  They are keen to the fact the even though their great-grandfather may have been Jewish,  they themselves would have been sent to a Death Camp.

Jews, as a scholarly people, tend to approach the Knowledge academically.  Which frankly hasn't done wonders for our survival rate.  Diaspora works, and if it isn't broken why fix it?  But the Knowledge comes through.  We were slaves. I was a slave.  I am a slave.  As long as there is oppression.  We have been shambling in our manacles since Exodus.   Struggling, hoping to free ourselves and others.  Sometimes some of us get stupid.  But there we are, chain ganged  to our mothers and our fathers; our family promise a whip through the ages.

It strikes me as more than coincidence that the same things that tie me to my People also tie me to a little black boy growing up in the skids of Baltimore a decade before I was born.

Some of you who grew up with me may recall my rants against White people and privilege.  How could I even consider being attracted to someone who stands on the systematic marginalization of my family, since before Mathematics existed or History was invented.  In the wake of that great un-discussable, how could I love those who made my grandparents crazy, who made my parents crazy, who made me crazy.  The Klan was active not a few blocks from my childhood home.

My parents nodded.  They understood.  They taught me not to Hate.  But this wasn't Hate.  This was wanting a safe place.  A place where I wouldn't be constantly confronted by the crazy past, by the nonsensical now.  Every side walk and manicured lawn was the product of the theft of my blood and ashes.  Holocaust dialogue is Never Again.  The unspoken message is When.  Each Yiddishe kid worth two buttons asks themselves, my childhood raped?  Will I be an Adult?  Will I be prepared?

TNC most certainly had it harder than I did.  But the values are the same.  Reading "The Beautiful Struggle" was like reading an alternate version of my youth.  In fact, it was closer to what my mother experienced, sans the nerd.  But there is a lot of Truth in what he writes. So even if you are the progeny of the great oppressor classes, I think you'll still gain some gem of wisdom by reading it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend was the first time I have genuinely enjoyed myself since I got to Raleigh, and it was lovely!  Here is how it all went down:

<b><u>Wednesday:</u></b> After my meetings in the morning and afternoon, I went and got a haircut in preparation for...

<img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Snpl6S4iZDI/AAAAAAAACdA/x2RuXgkQE20/s400/p8050042.jpg" />

<b><u>Thursday:</u></b> ...when I went to get new glasses and a new prescription.  Unfortunately, the optomitrist was all booked up and so I had to come back on...

<b><u>Friday:</u></b> After my morning workout routine.  I was forever at the optomotrists, but luckily, the girls who worked there were <i>hilarious</i>.  It was cookie Friday; I got some.  Unfortunately, I was so late that I didn't get to spend a lot of time working.  Shabbat was upon us.  I could have been a bad kid and worked on.  But I had seen some flyers and read some blogs.  <a href="http://www.newraleigh.com/articles/archive/love-bug-the-great-bug-draw-off-art-exhibit/">LOVE BUG</a> was calling out to me.   Not really understanding what it was, I went back to the hotel to freshen up before heading to the 101 Lounge, downtown, for the Great Bug Draw Off.

What "Love Bug" turned out to be was a timed, competitive, spectator art show for charity.  So at the outside bar of the lounge, they lined up artists who had tags on their backs like marathon runners.  There were two preliminary rounds of 25 minutes where, in their chosen medium, local artists would scramble to produce bug-related art on 8 x 10 cards as fast as they could.  Each time one was done, a moderator would lift it up, show the crowd, and then walk it inside.  Most cards were sold before they left the stand; each was $25.  The crowd often pushed into the street.  The artists from each session who sold the most were advanced to the last round of 15 mins in which larger more elaborate pictures were created.  All the proceeds benefited non-profit <a href="http://www.toxicfreenc.org/">Toxic Free NC</a>, whose stated goal is to remove dangerous chemicals from the hands of children.  Fantastic.

But why is this important?  Well, the 101 lounge certainly made a killing selling bug-based drinks like the <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2100835_bees-knees-cocktail.html">Bee's Knees</a>.  But what to note is that, while there was a swarm outside, more discerning folk would see that the lounge had two stories! And large portrait windows all around.  One side, naturally, was basically right above the bar where the worker-artists were humming away.  So the queen seats in the house were inside, upstairs looking down perfectly on the art and the people.  This is where the story starts.

Among the other queens enjoying such a visage, were a group of friends. Girls+. Sometimes some of them would go downstairs and communicate with the low-lying subjects in random-seeming walks.  In any event, it was fairly clear that the binaries and norms of the colonial subjects were at least <i>questioned</i> from such great heights.  After all, there is more than one way to make honey.

Woefully friendless in Raleigh prior to this point, I rectified my situation by spending a few hours casually chatting with this interesting bunch. Thereby proving I was not some sort of owl or bat or bullfrog.  I was invited to go see the opening of a photography exhibit at one of their coffee shops.  They were tragic pieces in Black and White biographing the lives of local homeless.  

Not wanting to say "Goodbye Forever" after this, we exchanged numbers.  


<b><u>Saturday:</u></b> Shawn, who has moved to Maryland for graduate studies, stopped by for the day.  We hung out, went downtown. Had dinner. Checked out their ridiculous live music in the park.  We walked around and saw all of the civil buildings (Raleigh is the capital recall).  Both of us wanting to drink more, but me having driven, we go and hit up a couple of euphemistically named liquor stores ("Campus Beverages") and a Kroger. Porter, Sauvignon Blanc, cherry ice cream, and whipped cream in hand, it hits me.

<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sn-mM44k5uI/AAAAAAAACi4/5BW4FQT_Qc4/s400/p8080043.jpg" />

<i>What if we take the 'root' out of Root Beer Float?</i> A bottle of wine and Beer Floats later, Shawn and I were nicely toasted.  We spend the rest of the evening entertaining ourselves on the Onion and Craigslist.

<b><u>Sunday:</u></b> Shawn and I head over to this delicious brunch place, southern style.  Humid as boring sin, we sit outside in the heat.  We go back to the hotel and sit off brunch for a bit. This is in preparation for going over to the mall across the thoroughfare and walking it off as well.  We come back to the hotel and try to watch old stand up comedy on Netflix, but it fails.  Shawn leaves me and Raleigh behind as he must need be in Lexington, VA that night.  I go over to one of my favourite haunts in town and order my new favourite: cafe meiele.  Somewhere in the  middle of writing a paper outline, one of my new found friends calls me.

Wow!  That was fast; I planning on calling or texting them to try to hang out on Wednesday if I hadn't heard back.   They were inviting me to a smore cookout / storytelling extravaganza.  It was a very subtle blast.  Suffice to say that I learned things about squid reproduction and sea cucumber survival tactics that I had never known before.  Stop me if you've heard this one.  

And now I am here, back in my hotel room, smoke seeped into my hair.  But present in such a way that I feel absolutely free.  I've got my Status Back, Baby.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The times are fast upon us.  That is right people, my first in a series of 25th birthdays is coming up! (I subcontract out City of Austin Utilities to Tuck Everlasting Water Management.)  But my birthday is on a Tuesday this year.  LAME.

Therefore, I have pegged off Friday August 21st for the Quarter Life Crisis / ATX Homecoming / Back-to-School Party!  However, I am out of town and busy writing a paper right now.  So I am taking suggestions.  What do you want to see done?  The wackier, crazier, more nutso the idea, well, you know me.  The more likely it is to grab me.  Have At!

		<title>Genderfuck and Me -or- Do You Know What the Queers are Doing to Our Soil?!</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the most important post I will make this year, so read up!

<blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderfuck"><b>Genderfuck:</b></a> The act of acquiring sexual dimorphic traits that are not of one's own gender for the express purpose of parody. Ex. Women wearing fake moustaches; Men with breasts, <i>et al</i>.</blockquote>

I was recently introduced to the (formal) idea of genderfuck.  Flipside got me thinking about it even more.  This summer I did my research. Genderfuck offers a paradigm that explains and guides vast smears of my sexuality.

<b><u>HISTORY:</u></b>

I am sort of genderfucky myself.  Those of you who have known me for a while know that I had very long hair until sometime late high school.  I was always teased or taken for a girl until sometime at the end of middle school, when I could grow a beard.  Even then if someone only saw me from behind, I got "Excuse me, Miss" for a couple of more years.  What fewer of you know is that this had been happening since I was 3 months old.

Crazy Cashier: What a cute little girl! How old is she?
My Mother: It's a boy, HE is three months old.
Crazy Cashier: Awww, what's her name?
My Mother: HIS name is Anthony!
Crazy Cashier: Hmmmm, 'Anthony' is weird name for a girl...

Also, apparently sometime in 2nd grade I would come home crying all the time because I was being teased about looking like a girl.  My parents, who always let us choose what we wanted to look like, could no longer handle it.  They said that if I couldn't toughen up, my choice was gone.  They would forcefully cut my hair.  Ever obstinate, I stopped crying.  I do not recall this series of events.

<b><u>OH GIRLFRIEND:</u></b>

Genderfucked is what I want my partner to be.  Famously, <a href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/2009/06/16/">earlier this summer</a> my cousin called me "a fucking fetishist."  Kinks often establish themselves early.  For instance, part of my reading this summer took me to "Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk".  Intermediate Types being early 20th century parlance for LGBT and Primitive Types being ancient peoples (Greek, Asian, American, etc.)  The following passage is both the hottest thing in the world to me and how I would like to get married.

<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oCEKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Intermediate+types+and+primitive+folk&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=b0QnSvGpVT&amp;sig=eXkUqFBjBvj6BDvYengpk530tVs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AKSMSpy-N8egmAfd-bS0DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=snippet&amp;q=rushes&amp;f=false">page 114s - 115,</a>
<blockquote><i>"There appears to have been a curious custom in Sparta connected with the ordinary marriage by capture which may be mentioned here as suggesting some wavering so to speak at that time of the line between male and female The bridegroom says Mueller brought the young virgin having carried her off from the chorus of maidens or elsewhere to the bride's maid who cut short her hair and left her lying in a man's dress and shoes without a light on a bed of rushes until the bridegroom returning from the public supper carried the bride to the nuptial couch and unloosed her girdle. Whatever may have been the exact meaning of this custom it almost suggests that marriage by capture of women was preceded by marriage by capture of youths [young men]."</i></blockquote>

I am often accused of having a perverse and distasteful thing for lesbians.  But that couldn't be father from the truth.  From a Game-of-Life Theory standpoint why would I waste time lusting after people who will never love me back?  I want what I have requited, heavily.  Yes, I have been known to say that I have an attraction to the 'Dyke Aesthetic', whatever that means.  But I postulate that this is because the canonical lesbian is genderfuck, not that I want to be with lesbians.

<b><u>NAME MAGIC COUNTER:</u></b>

Naturally, in all this thinking, I was fearful.  What if 'genderfuck' is simply name-magic to make myself feel better about prior events?  Am I in danger of falling in love with a label and not a person?  After some further thought and discussion, I don't think so.

First off, I was pointed to the framework of genderfuck being more of an 'Anti-Label' than a true descriptor.  It is what you call someone who fundamentally rejects imposed norms and gender binaries (labels) and is willing to take a personal stand against them.  But the (at least) partial use of humour takes the immediate threat out of such opposition.  Genderfuck is about more than simply cross-dressing. It is cross-dressing sans the intent to deceive.

Secondly and personally, as a kink genderfuck is legitimized away from 'label' criticisms.  It doesn't have to make sense to anyone; it doesn't even have to make sense to me.  It is my deep seeded, emotionally charged compulsion.  Some people, for instance, have Centaur fetishes.  I count my lucky stars that mine actually exists.  And therefore, it is not unreasonable to ask that my sex partners indulge my fantasy in return for me partaking in theirs to have a healthy relationship.

So even though I may be crazy, at least I am still rational.  We may proceed.

<b><u>QUEER STRAIGHT:</u></b>

In my review of what genderfuck really is, I ran across "Queer At Last? Straight Intellectuals and the Desire for Transgression" by Annette Schlichter in GLQ.  Did someone write a journal article about me before we even met?!  Ms Schlichter's paper had two main take away points.

<b>(1) The term 'queer' is so general that it is possible to be a queer straight.  Queer merely means different.  Thus it is possible to reject heteronormativity while remaining heterosexual in practice.

(2) However, queer straights, as demonstrated by self-identified people in the literature, as a rule go through a transformation process whereby they 'realize themselves to be queer.'  This transgression makes them not truly queer.  This is because, by analogy, the queer straight is in the same position of any one who is a member of an oppressive majority, though they may support a minority.  For instance, a white person who historically supported blacks does not suddenly become black.  Nor does a man who is a feminist become a woman.  Unfortunately, they still stand on the shoulders of implicit, systematic privilege.</b>

Well, point (1) seems to apply, if I could be convinced to call myself heterosexual.  But point (2) means that there will be problems calling myself a queer straight.

But given my history, I am still queer.  I never went through the type of transformation that Ms Schlichter deftly outlines.  I was raised queer so there never was a need for a metamorphic period.  Yes, this may be a function of my freaky parents having their freaky children.  An exception even in the queer world.  Pretty much every homo I have ever talked to *knew* (often from quite early ages) that they were other-sexual.  Same with me, no alterations to identity required.  At worst, I have the sort of parents that little fag kids across the country spend the days dreaming they had instead of their own ignorant and biased set.

In fact, I see my experience as being a source of major long-term criticism for "Queer at Last."  The straight-who-becomes-queer may be a myth.  But as more and more non-traditional families are started, more folk like me will pop up. I won't be alone in not really being homosexual but not heteronormative either.  My type will never replace 'normal' but maybe it will stop being wrong.

But Ms Schlichter does give us the ability to answer a persistent question I receive.  "<i>Why don't you just find some long-haired straight girl who probably longs to be a tomboy and have her cut her hair?</i>"  It is for this transformation reason described.  She isn't queer when I meet her, so I am not interested.  If she picks up on this (and this has happened) she may cut her hair thinking to get close to me.  But even though I didn't enact the transformation she still didn't transgress.  And even if she had transgressed, she still took full advantage of her heternormative privilege.  She would be a facsimile of what I am really interested in.  The aesthetic does not give her the values nor the experiences.

<b><u>EXCEPTION ADDENDUM:</u></b>

*I forgot to mention this above.*  Gays and lesbians and straights will talk about those one or two special members of the sex that they are not typically attracted to who really do it for them.  By analogy, the same is certainly true for me.  There are a couple of 'normal' people out there who completely turn my crank.  But this is the exception, not the rule.

Additionally, if the attraction is strong enough I try to establish some basis for deviance in them that probably doesn't exist.  Story time: my middle school teacher (Ms Smit), my mother, and I were eating at a restaurant.  At the time, one of my friends was dating a girl (Meenon) from the other middle school in the district.  My mother and mentor informed me the the girl in question was a complete babe/goddess.  I didn't see it nor understand it because her visage was fairly standard.  I have since come to understand that she solidly beats me in some aspects of deviance, though it wasn't initially apparent.

On the other hand, if my first experience with someone was at a burn-event, competitive art competition, gay club, LARP, or basically anything else that has one putting on costumes and running around naked in rain (happens more often than you'd think), then I understand if you have to play the normative card outside of such events to get by.  I know initially that you are something other than you seem.  Personally, I feel that I have been trending to a more respectable look to work in my more conservative field.  However, after I open my mouth it is all pretty much over.

Time to go play dress-up, wanna come?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two things. I haven't been getting enough work done recently.  Today for instance.  I was going to spend the night programming after my departmental function.  But no.  During the after-party at Crown &amp; Anchor, I got shamefully drunk on a pint and a half of beer.  This seems to be happening a lot lately.  If I eat what I normally eat (salad+) then I can't drink how I used to drink.  So I spent the rest of the night eating and sleeping off a hangover.  LAME.  I am LAME.  

Secondly, this weekend was my first time fully cross dressing in public.  We went dancing on the pedestrian bridge over the river.  Every article down to my shoes (W40) was intended for women or not meant as clothing (chain link belt).  Sure, the shirt was given to me by a girl in North Carolina, but it is a women's cut so it counts.  For those of you not here to enjoy it:

Also, secret bonus third line item: Beanie for my birthday gave me two pounds of coffee beans (yeah!).  Which is frankly too much for me to drink in any reasonable time frame.  So I am thinking Chocolate Coffee Cookies, anyone in? Just want to help me eat them?  That is fine too.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am enjoying Paris much more than I thought I would.  Outside of the conference, life is very relaxed and my non-existent French is not as much of a barrier as I thought it would be.

Now, don't get me wrong.  The city is still founded on imperial thuggery.  And if anyone can lay claim to the copyright on Urban Sprawl it is the Parisians.  But generally things are quite nice.  Perhaps it is the excellent coffee that is lubricating my attitude.

I gave my first real presentation at an international scientific congress yesterday.  And not completely blowing it equals success.  When you are the youngest, least accomplished person in the room by 20 years (and all of the others present are DOE and foreign equivalent bigwigs), the audience can be quite imposing.

Also, in a fit of cosmic annoyance, my adviser missed my debut!  He had to cover for a talk that was scheduled at the exact same time...

More to come, surely.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>[Paris] Metal Burn</title>
		<link>http://scopatz.blog.com/2009/09/13/paris-metal-burn/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was the best of times, or some other Dickensian nonsense. Paris was much more enjoyable than I had anticipated.  The city, if done right, can be quite pleasant.  The conference was better than expected as well.  I even enjoyed one of the plenary sessions.  The first panel was my Nuclear Engineering dream team sans el Baradei.  

<a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Paris#">My photos can be found here.</a> But by far the best experience I had went as follows.  Picture it, I had just had dinner with my co-worker, a two crepe and coffee course, at a little place near the backside of Notre Dame.  She needed to get back to the hotel to prep for her talk the next day.  I had seen on the map "Place Dauphine" on the other end of the island in the Seine on which that great cathedral sits.  Being a Jeanne d'Arc fanatic, I was of course interested in a park dedicated to her liege-lord.  Is it right for a Jew to have a patron saint all picked out (break glass in case of Catholicism)?  Likely a topic that will take a separate discourse to answer.  It was 9:30 pm.

On my way, I noticed at the rear of the church-under-remodel Cafe Esmeralda and I said to myself "Hah, you cannot trick me; I have read Victor Hugo and know your little game."  Further on I stopped and took pictures of dramatically lit gargoyles.  Then it happened.

<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sq0s1caAA1I/AAAAAAAACxw/J5_3x4rwXYw/s400/p9090045.jpg" />

Turning the corner to the front of Notre Dame there were people.  A lot of people.  A crowd.  Even better this throng seemed to be dedicated to the noble task of blowing bubbles.  Had I just wandered into the best flash mob ever?! Yes.  Clearly, these were my people.  

Eventually, a large man with short black hair, a large black satchel, wearing a black suit with a white shirt came by. He took a bubble vial out of his bag and handed it to me.  I knew what to do.

<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sq0s5Nu1mUI/AAAAAAAACyY/EWRu98b2Tv0/s400/p9090061.jpg" />
<i>White dots in sky are bubbles reflecting the camera flash.</i>

But knowing only brings further questions.  What was this all about?  Right as I was about to leave, after the photographs, TV cameras, and inquisitive police, I saw her running around speaking perfect English. 
"Can I have another bottle?"

After Carla got a second serving of the miracle stuff from our provider, she ran off blowing with reinvigorated enthusiasm.  Carla was lithe and hyper-active.  She wore classy black cargo pants, a black sleeveless top, and a simple gold cross necklace.  Her hair was Red.  Char Aznable 
red.  The kind of dark/bright red that is in no way natural but cannot be begrudged on those grounds.  It was cropped short and tipped black.

Of course, I asked her what all the bubbles were about.  "Who knows?! I was told it is a Celebration of Life!"  Check.  We wandered through the throng blowing bubbles for a bit longer.  It turns out she is a Neurobiology PhD student in Bonn and was in Paris for, what else, but an international congress.  Her English was so good because she had previously spent 10 months working at an equestrian hospital in Oakdale, CA (near Sacramento).  "We should go see my co-workers." Mate.

I spent the next hour or so blowing bubbles and hanging out with these four awesome German biology PhD students.  They were all pretty neat.  At one point, they busted out beers from a small cooler they brought with them.  So now my canonical view of France is sitting in front of Notre Dame, amongst babes and bubbles, complaining about Corona and the superiority of darker brews.

Is it a function of my personality that I get into these situations?  Or is it my wacky life that has thoroughly skewed my persona?  The chicken is cooking scrambled eggs, surely.

At one point Carla asked me what I did for fun.  "This! Celebration of Life,"  I answered.   By now I had put together the obvious similarities between the current situation and the Burner Community.  Keeping it simple I said, "Have you hear of Burning Man?"  Her excitement was palpable.  She was unaware of any German burns, but her year in California taught her what she needed to about what happens in the desert. She wants to go, but it is that much more expensive with the intercontinental flight.  

But what she does for fun is analogous.  She, somewhat obviously, is into Metal.  So she goes to all of the big European Metal concerts.  So we start talking about metal bands we like or have seen.  I've seen Tyr; 
She has seen Dio; I am jealous.  

This spawned a conversation between her and one of her co-workers about what was actually good.  If you have never seen two passionate Germans argue about what 'real' metal is, then you have not lived.  Their focus was only broken half-an-hour later when an androgynous French child in desperate need of Ritalin ran by.  Her/His disengaged parents were on the other side of a shrubbery managing the one still in the cradle.

We supplied the kid with a bubble bottle.  It's contents were quickly dumped onto the ground after the little lips failed to produce the desired soapy effect. 

<img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sq0tBEnB8-I/AAAAAAAACzo/9CQKhLMC0Zc/s400/p9090072.jpg" />

Somewhere in all of this the flash mob broke up. They were replaced by drummers and a girl in Arabian pants spinning poi on the steps of Notre Dame.  The whirling balls of flame, naturally, attracted our ADHD adoptee.  When mein klein homunculus ran straight for the fire was the only time I saw the mother step in and stop her ward.

Sitting there, I thought to myself, "Esmerelda lives!"]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well it seems like I can't please everyone.  Some people think my posts are too long.  Others feel they are too cryptic.  Still others think that my 'musings on women' and my sexuality are 'annoying.'

<img src='http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sq0sqgSYt-I/AAAAAAAAC_s/LqkmrvhhZWU/s400/p9090023.jpg' />

<b><u>Exciting News!</u></b>  So given the recent criticisms, I am going to tell you about it in a short, encoded, and peevish fashion.  

So while I was in Paris, my adviser and I had a meeting where we decided that it would be good for me to spend some time north of the wall.  It is known that it is quite a magical land up there.  Which is good since previous attempts to befriend the majestic unicorn have been successful.  So it looks like this expedition is going to take place.  It took a lot of work to get this off the ground.  After all, one does not simply jumping stilts into Mordor.

However, in the interim Super Secret Project 2 has come to a close.  How this affects the northern climes (not to mention where everyone loves vagina) is unclear.  It has also come to light that Duncan Idaho of House Atreides has a made a similar passage to the one I am about to embark upon.  I expect an upset among expatriate Argentine cowboys.

Unlike K. D. Lang (not my brother), Super Secret Project 2 is not +5.  Maybe it is -5.  Maybe it is 0.  Maybe it is +2.5.  Still, I now have no desire for lollipops nor hats worn by old ladies. Despite what you believe, people change.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I realize I haven't updated in a while.  Or really been out of the house.

<b>Surprise! Guess who had Swine Flu?!</b>

Well, at least now I am back in the swing of things.  I no longer feel like death.  Right well in time for me to run off to California and Wisconsin this month.  Woo hoo...

The major event I more or less missed due to illness were High Holy Days this year.  I sort of book-ended them.  I went to the first day of Rosh Hashanah and the concluding services for Yom Kippur.  I was not well enough to fast, sadly.  

But more than this, I didn't really get out apologies this year.  I sent out one email.  To which I have yet to hear a response.   Many of those whom have received them in the past were not slated for them this year.  Which is good news.  But a bunch of new people who didn't get them simply won't.   For better or worse, I have turned.

So if you felt like I owe you an apology, consider it granted.  On the other hand, if you feel like you have wronged me in the past, you are now forgiven.

It seems a bit antiseptic to do it in this blanket fashion, but hey!  I was really fucking sick.  And as my mom told me, Swine Flu isn't even Kosher!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What?! A Month?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[So I haven't updated in a WHOLE month.  Even my "minimum once-a-week" rule has been shamelessly broken.  My Google Reader is in a complete disarray.  I have been busy.

Right now is the first night of a 10 day stint in Madison.  It has involved, keys, bike rides, meeting people, citywide WiFi, bourbon on the rocks, and beer.  Have I mentioned that I love this place yet?  Fear not AustiKnights, you are still bigger and have better weather.  I was really concerned that I would be completely burnt out by the time I got up here and come to resent this trip,  but so far I love it.

Of course loving Madison requires <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/PumpkinPatch#">leaving the Pumpkin Patch behind</a>...

...though supposedly drunken corn mazes are all the rage up here. (1 liter of Cranberry Juice and 1 liter of Vodka in a Camelbak, seriously?! That is fantastic.)  

But that has all been in the last 2 and a half days.  Before that I was in the Bay Area.  Someday I will live in my house. Can I hear it for November?  

If there is one thing I have learned, there are a lot of fucking cool people in America.  All distilled separately, it proves hard to mix them.  Seems I'll just have to keep travelling and sampling.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hello Everyone!

Sorry that I missed Pallas.  It sounds like those of you who went had a really great time!  Normally, I would be completely jealous.  But instead I was here...

<img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SuemA8al7VI/AAAAAAAAEHc/vJy0Ae2ChJA/s400/pa240005.jpg" />

...having an equally good time.

Basically, Madison rocks.  Maybe not as hard nor as long as Austin does, but it is still damn cool.  I understand that my experience may be atypical.  I have many excellent friends here from several vectors.  Also, it is an escape where I can dedicate my time to programming.  Which is lovely.  Most grad students spend the vast majority of their time doing tasks extraneous to their actual research.  So when you get a chance to do what you are interested in you take it.

That has been my life here: 12-17 hours of research + 4 hours of hanging out (drinking and eating cheese) + 3- 8 hours of sleep.  It has been bliss.  I feel really at home here.  A different home.  It probably helps that my co-worker here is from Belleville and Nakia is from Madison.

Still, I am coming and staying home tomorrow.  I'll get to be in one place for 6 weeks!  I am excited.  I am also pleased to be leaving their midwestern climes.  I grew up with this and left it with purpose and dedication.  California had my graces for a decade, as does Texas now.

More than anything, I am looking forward to seeing my main squeeze Anne.  One more day and I promise I won't leave you anymore.  This semester.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Once and Future Pumpkin</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My Halloween kinda sucked.  For some stupid reason a conference paper draft deadline was at midnight..  So guess who got to work 12 hours that day.  I submitted the paper at 10:45pm.  Needless to say, it did not leave a lot of time for partying. 

But with the help of Anne, <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Halloween09#">we did manage to salvage the night</a>.  We carved a pumpkin, cooked the seeds, and then watched some Golden Girls.  As my ninja carrot friend in Madison consoled me later, "<i>The Golden Girls make everything right.</i>"

<img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Su844NX1EAI/AAAAAAAAEQM/QXEO_XhUkg8/s400/pa310001.jpg" />

But onto WHY I was working all throughout my favorite secular holiday.  My future gets decided, soon.  Which is very very stressful.  For those of you who didn't know, I am supposed to graduate from UT in May.  I am not convinced that this will happen.  Nor am I convinced that it will occur by August (my adviser's revised date).  In any case, the professors are all making noises that it is coming soon.

<b>There is a 95% chance that when I graduate, I leave Austin as well.</b>  Now what this means exactly is rather unclear.  Where will I go?  Who will I work for?  How much money will I make?  Will I be in the country? At a university?  At a national lab?  Will I move to a more technical track or will I get slotted into policy?  Will I still be collaborating with this broadening research group?

The short answer to these is, "Fuck if I know..."  What ever happens, I will probably be traveling as much as ever.  So the 4+ months that I spend outside of Texas will be flipped.  I am probably going to be around Austin at least a few weeks out of the year.  One of those weeks you can count your pretty pennies on (read: Flipside).

One of the professors in my department recommended me trying to become the one really technical policy nuclear engineer out there. He has an interesting idea.  I have the knack for it on all sides.  And it is sort of a non-standard gig, so I could probably really make a name for myself.  Which is essential for entering the world of Academe proper.

Ok, no biggie right?  No.  I haven't had a face to face meeting with my adviser in over a month.  The ones we try to have keep getting moved around and rescheduled.  I have the (unjustifiable) feeling that he might be avoiding me.  I think that they call it abandonment.  

I mean, I have more than enough work to do.  But I am getting nervous.  What are my contributions to the field going to be?  Am I worth it?  Can I be a technical policy leader?  What will that kind of prestige cost? Am I willing to pay it?  I know understand the phrase, "Dare to Dream".  

<b>Dreams are scary...</b>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>It is all about the network....</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a bad dream Sunday night.  

Let me explain.  I was chasing my Papa around the beach, through the tents and the recumbent chairs. He was dapperly dressed and riding an electric bicycle, never looking back.  He died five years ago.  

My mom's father was the one who escaped.  By some miracle, his entire immediate family made it out of Germany right before they would have been sent to the death camps. 

As survivors, my family's existential crises are somewhat different than most peoples.  Most people, to stay sane, believe that if history had been slightly different then they themselves would be slightly different.  I, however, know that if things had been a little off I would not exist.  There would be no me to speak of.  Survival is a lot hard work, the will to make it, and a little luck.

That last point is what was driven home this weekend. Papa and his older brother had always refused to talk about their experiences.  "<i>Why do you want to know that?! It's ancient history...</i>"  What we do know is that after they escaped, the two boys went <i>back</i> over to Germany as spies for the U.S. Army Air Force.  To us children and grandchildren this means that we are of that rare breed of Jew that not only survived. We managed to actively fight back.

Several strange and unexplained artifacts were found when we cleaned out his place, post-mortum.   But that is where the information ended.  

Sunday, my mom spoke with my Great Uncle Kurt, my grandfather's brother.  Apparently, November 8th 1933(?) is the anniversary of their escape.   We were always told that they got on one of the last boats to leave in 1939.  This is not quite true.  

Uncle Kurt, on the same day decades later, told my mom that my Great Grandfather Gaston was friends with a member of the SS.  The SS man was so fond of Gaston that a few days before my family was supposed to be rounded up, he told my Great Grandfather to get his family out of the country.  His daughter, my now deceased Great Aunt Erica, was already living in Paris.  

But more than this, this SS fellow let Gaston, his wife, and his sons hide out in his house for four days before they themselves made their escape to France.  For now, the story ends there as Uncle Kurt did not want to go over any more on the phone.  

That is it.  My story is now more similar to the hundreds of others that managed to hide out.  I owe my life, every day, to the kindness of a stranger.  I owe it to the un-patriotism of someone who couldn't be more in the establishment.  I owe it to the network.  It is all about who you know, and when.  I owe it to being likable. 

We didn't just fight back, we were also supremely lucky. I don't know why my grandfather refused to look back at me in my dream.  I don't know what that means.  I just want to catch his memory.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Mom&#039;s Out (of the sick people place)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know, I know.  I haven't been particularly good at communicating.  It is getting to me even; I have felt disconnected.  I didn't even log into my email for several days, waiting until I had something good to write.  Life has been an emotional steamroller, slowly compressing my innards onto the hot, black pavement below.

<b>UPDATE:</b> So my mom was hospitalized the day after I returned to CA.  This was her 7th or 8th Emergency Room visit in 6 weeks and her second hospital admittance.  Most of the rest of this time I was deep in finals week.  Then, when she went in this latest time I was stuck in The Valley (LA) and couldn't escape until the next day.

<b>DIAGNOSIS:</b>  My mom had several issues going on simultaneously which made finding and treating any of them difficult.  What it looks like it came down to was a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) coupled with Sciatica (a pinched nerve in her lower spinal column).  [NOTE: she did not have Cirrhosis as previously reported, stupid Google autocompletion].   

Unfortunately, all of the pain medicines they were giving her were cut with acetaminophen, so she didn't have a fever.  Which meant she was asymptomatic for the UTI.  And since she has only the one kidney, this infection put her in even more pain and a whole lot of danger.  

Also due to her strange biology, she was hypersensitive to the pain that the Sciatica was causing.  This caused her first doctor to tell her that she was faking it, it was all in her head, and to "Shut Up"  when she was crying and moaning.  He then proceeded to treat her with two conflicting anti-psychotics.  Consider that asshole fired.

Over the course of this 6+ week period, she probably ate only the equivalent of 10 meals and slept close to  30 hours.  Yes, she was only able to get 30 minutes of sleep a day while simultaneously on Vicodin, Valium, and Morphine.  Restlessly wasting away was not helping the healing process.

<b>SECOND RELEASE:</b> She was released again only a few days ago.  The treatment for the UTI is an easy course of wide spectrum antibiotics.  The treatment for the Sciatica was a cortisone shot to the nerve in her spine.  Unfortunately, the shot takes 2-3 days to kick in.  Friday was the first day that she was really up and at 'em again.

Hopefully, this is will be at least a semi-permanent fix.  We'll see what the good doctor says tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>
