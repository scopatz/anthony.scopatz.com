AvilinFaithful: See to me it indicates that they might be more willing
to look at society critically than others, obviously this is gross
generalization, but it is more true than not in my experiance<br>(16:42:56) AvilinFaithful: I need that in a woman<br>(16:43:32) onsede: to me it indicates that they don't need feminine hair to feel pretty<br>(16:46:27) AvilinFaithful: which is surely implies that they have tried different veiw points than the normally accepted ones<br>(16:46:39) onsede: pretty much<br>(16:46:47) onsede: or that they're just above it all = P<br>(16:47:12) onsede: now of course, being older and wiser now i know that's not completely true<br>(16:48:02) AvilinFaithful: I mean the occational chick with long hair will be smokin' but...<br>(16:48:51)
AvilinFaithful: That is why I feel kinda wierd with short hair myself,
sure it is practical and everything but I am certainly not challenging
any norms with it<br>(16:49:29) AvilinFaithful: On the other hand, I am trying to do that in other ways now<br>(16:50:14) onsede: i've always been for challenging norms in less superficial ways<br>(16:53:18)
AvilinFaithful: Well, but the superficial ways have a benefit. I
realize that this applies far less to you than to me at our current
points in life. But when you first get to a new place and are meeting
new people, what is gonna indicate to people that you are worth talking
to before you exchange any words? Your appearance matters a lot in
those sorts of situations<br>(16:54:03) AvilinFaithful: Since I am
trying to attract a certain type of person, I have to, in some sense,
accomidate my appearance top thier desires<br>(16:54:31) onsede: ahh<br>(16:54:36) onsede: see i always love the enigma though<br>(16:54:46) onsede: the straightlaced looking guy who does experimental music<br>(16:55:03) onsede: the hippy looking guy who dreams of working on wallstreet..<br>(16:56:19) AvilinFaithful: well, see I have changed from the second to the first now<br>(16:56:49) AvilinFaithful: And not really to the first<br>(16:57:48) AvilinFaithful: My aesthetic mind has grown/altered a lot recently and I want my appearance to reflect that<br>(16:58:25) AvilinFaithful: There is a certain pleasure in dressing well, too.<br>(17:00:05) onsede: i'm wearing a button up shirt and slacks right now = P<br>(17:00:12) onsede: some day i may even master makeup<br>(17:01:29)
AvilinFaithful: I mean we have this perception that people in the
twenties dressed well not because they had the money to and thus could
show off (some of them certainly didn't) but because it was important to<br>(17:02:36) onsede: yeah<br>(17:02:43) onsede: things have really gone downhill in that regard<br>(17:04:15)
AvilinFaithful: It certainly has. I am trying to dress more according
to that philosophy but radical wardrobe changes are expensixve so it is
taking me longer than I'd like...I think my next step is socks</td></tr>

(Judd) in my limited contact with her has done the same. "I would love
to hang out", but she's always busy. Here is the confusing thing, if
she didn't want to, she just wouldn't respond to my emails right? But
she does respond, but we still don't do anything, Gaaah. I have decided
to wait a week before re-attempting contact. I contacted her 3 times
last week and we only did the one thing. Is a week enough? Oh well, I
am busy myself right now because of....<br><br>Grad School! First Texas
really wants me. Then, they say they are concerned about how my grades
took a dip Junior year (They did NOT read my personal Statement wherein
all of this was explained.) Which is essentially saying the same thing
as we don't want you (to my emotional state at least). But in the same
breath as "concerned about my grades" they also invited me out to texas
to tour the place. WTF. I think this trip to Austin will essentially
make or break my grad school oppertuinity next year. Which really means
that this is an interview from which I cannot go home and cry. I think
I will just have to tell them straight up why my grades fell and then
explain that those problems will go away if I move 2000 miles from
home, and then hope they have mercy on my carrer as a scientist.<br><br>Mixed Signals, Man.  Life is really weird.</td></tr>

has instilled in me a real hatred for him. I am experiancing feeling I
have never experiance towards anyone else. This leads to compulsions
which would give a criminal record if carried out. Being the better
person is not wholly satisfying me with regards to Dan. I dislike him
so intensely because I percieved that he has betrayed me. I think this
is a general feeling amoung my friends but I will not claim that how I
percive events is what actually went down. Dante was a large influence
on my young psyche (with other classics as well). In Inferno, one may
recall that Satan appears as a large dog with three heads one each of
our national colors. In the Maw of each head is a different corpus
screaming in eternal Agony. They are Judas, Brutus and Cassius. Judas
is obvious and Brutus and Cassius of course betrayed Julius Ceaser. As
a Jew, the meaning behind this is largely allegorical, but the meaning
is important to me. Trust is the highest quality one can have in
another person. Renegging on that trust is the largest offence. Notice
how those in the worst damnation all committed crimes against their
fellow humans, while mere atheists were all chillin' over starbucks in
Limbo. Fuck Dan Stuart.<br><br>Syd confuses me. I love her. I think she
is a good person; in general. She did me no great betrayl like Dan.
However she did lie to me if not explicitly then by withholding
information through a semantic cop out. It will take time for me to
forgive her, but today she did apologize which goes a long way in my
book. I might even be able to let Dan back into my gaming group after
his dishonorable actions if he were to apologize on his own free
willrather than smugly thinking he has done no wrong while Janus-like
trying to prevent me from being hurt by the damage he has done. Still
sometimes Syd pisses me off since she is not wholly removed from guilt
in the matter. She is irrationally, incredibly stubborn. Once she takes
a stance on something she will not waver from it ever. She cannot even
be persuaded to think about other options once she has taken a stance.
Even if every other option has a better outcome for her she will not
think about it for weeks or months after the fact. She is Epimethius
Incarnate on some issues. It isn't just big emotionally charged issues
either, it can be small stupid things. This was the source of much
conflict in our relationship. If she was as grown up as I would expect
a hyper-analytic person to be in this manner we would not have had half
the problems we did. Not that we all don't go through simmilar things
ocassionally. However, recently all of those sorts of things in me I
was consiously using as a way to control my depression so as not to go
off the deep end while my family was in crisis. I even explained this
to Syd many times. Somehow I don't think she ever really accpeted that
for a time I had to be sad no matter what else was going on. Our
breakup is a perfect example of syd doing something that with some
thought could have been avoided and a better result for everyone would
have resulted. I think she just wanted us to have a better
relationship, and really who can blame a girl for that. Just don't go
with the first random solution. As much as I want to break Dan's
kneecaps, I think the pain of knowing he actually is incapable of real,
true friendship may be enough suffering for that maggot infested crap
pile. See, my first compulsion would have been bad for me ^_^<br><br>Now,
Terrorism. Paul Krassner back in the sixties had "Fuck Communism"
Posters printed up and sold. They were offensive, but to whom? If
anyone dared to ask him to remove the sign, he would shout them down by
saying that they were soft on Communism. It worked on anyone, police
included. Most Decency-In-The-Media people were the same ones who used
anti-communism propoganda to create blacklists and the like. "Fuck
Communism" was a brilliant move. There is a story of some high school
student who for the graduation pictutre pulled out a "Fuck Communism"
poster at the last moment. Since the school could not simpily white out
the word Fuck -- leaving only Communism -- they whited out the whole
poster and there is a funny student holding a white sign in the final
version of this grad picture. Terrorism is the new Communism, so I
thought it worked. I hope to make a Fuck Terrorism poster and flash it
at Paul Krassner when I go to see him in June.</td></tr>

yeah, I went out to the apartment last night to visit Shawn. We tried
to take a bus downtown but we missed it. Instead we stayed at his place
and saved a bunch of money by making drinks there. I cannot tell you
what I had to drink last night. Actually this might be a funn exercise,
I'll try.<br><br>Half a beer<br>A shot of Whiskey<br>Coke with two shots of rum + lime.<br>Caipeirosca (that is totally misspelled, it is a really good brazillian drink)<br>Another half a beer<br>Another Shot of Whiskey<br>A Shot of whiskey in a back alley way<br>and a Shot of Whiskey to finish it off.<br><br>This
is good, it helps me predict when I'll be sober again. But yeah, Pretty
early on, Syd came and joined us and then when we were about to leave
the house to go to a ba and walk down DP I made Jon leave his Woman
(World of Warcraft) and come with us. Unfortunately IV SUCKS ASS. It
was 11:40 and the bars had already given last call. WTF! It just meant
I saved more money. In any event, we went on DP (I was far and wide the
most shickered btw). Obeying the Scopatz principle of Equishittynessall
music was equally bad. However there were two crappy live bads. For the
record, I really enjoyed myself at the time. Howevere much the two
bands were alike in shittyness, the second band had a far better
drummer. So I liked those guys more.<br><br>I think the key to getting
to the point where you are kinda out of it is not just a lot of booze
but also the will power. Also I am pretty certain that not drinking
water really until you are done drinking helps a lot.<br><br>I saw
Duncan Neilsen Last Night! He goes to City College and we totally ran
into each other on DP. Syd knows Nick so I introduced her. What is with
getting tipsey and then seeing people from my past.<br><br>I am
secretly hoping that I can get inebriated enough that I can then induce
a high that will resemble a drug trip. I can already kind of do this
with more (un)natural stimuli. The occassional movie will be so far out
that by though some process of enchantment I can induce a faux-high.
Last night was the first time where I felt this sort of
conncertion/release-of-self was possible after having imbibed.
Typically I in some sense feel dulled. Not this Time! I'll have to
perfect my methodology...maybe I need to get kinda out of it and then
watch 200 Motels or Tetsuo: The Iron Man. I'll find something that
works. I really wanna experiance a Paul Krassner type LSD trip. Ya know
people's heads turning into rainbows and fun things like that. However
due to a strict moral code, I feel it is wrong to do illegal drugs
while they are illegal. Civil Disobediance and all that. Unfortunately
I don't think people will take to the streets in droves of protests
just so I can drop Acid. There is always Amsterdam. Just don't think of
David Bowie when you go there.<br><br>All right Peace out</td></tr>

was that fun. It turns out I really like the two drinks I ordered: A
White Russian and a shot of Don Julio tequilla with salt and a lime. <br><br>By far the best music I heard was when I put a buck into the Juke Box.  My Playlist?<br><br>ZZ Top - Cheap Sunglasses<br>James Brown - Papa's got a Brand New Bag<br>Frank Sinatra - Forget Domanni (sp?)<br><br>By
Far the Sinatra was the most danceable music I heard for the entire
night. This makes me really look forward to spending Christmas in Las
Vegas. My family and the Rowes are planning on meeting up there. I
wanna go get drunk in a lounge casino bar with my cousins and listen to
Jazz malet ensemble or Sinatra Cover band. That would be bliss.<br><br>In
other news, last night I ran into my friends Tanya and Irene. That
first time was fine. The second time reminded me of Neil Young's "The
Needle and The Damage Done." Here he says that "Every Junkie is like a
Setting Sun." Tanya was about as wasted as I have ever seen a friend
and Irene was more on top of things but that was because she had just
thrown up every drink she had that night. So one was super drunk and
one was just sad. I could type the whole saga, but really, why bother?<br><br>Cheers!</td></tr>
