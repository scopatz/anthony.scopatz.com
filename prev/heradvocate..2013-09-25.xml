		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I read this quote recently, or some quote like it:
<blockquote>There can be no progress, no real change, until the world stops eating meat.</blockquote>
I would love to find out who said it in the first place.  Walking down the street today, I saw a man texting in a white, sporty Honda Accord.   Later on, there was a man sitting at the stop light, with the windows rolled down, cranking <em>"Man Who Sold The World."</em> I sung along.  I was not embarrassed.

I own a car.  I pay for it.  I hardly ever use it.  I have friends who have given up their cars.  Sometimes, they ride the bus.  I am too much of a wimp.  Can there ever be any real change?  What is fake change?

I don't deserve avocados year round.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A funny thing happened on the way to the terminal from the other terminal, at Starbucks.

I am on my way to the DoE Fuel Cycle Research &amp; Development meeting in Washington DC.  (I am assuming I can talk about it since <a href="http://www.fuelcycleinnovations.org/winners2010.html">my face is on the website!</a>)  As I write this, however, I am in the Charlotte airport.

I went to Starbucks to try to buy my overpriced dinner.  Here was the conversation I had at least three times with two people:
<p style="padding-left: 30px">Barista:Do you want a bag?
Me:  No thanks, it is OK.  [No need for more bags, right?]
Barista: Would you like a fork for your fruit cup?
Me: No thank you.  [I have a bamboo utensil kit in my luggage.]
Barista: Are you sure you don't need a bag?
Me: Yes, thank you though.</p>
Maybe peeps in the NC just *really* like bags and plastic forks.  I can't say as I blame them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In case your not a complete nerd, the EIA (Energy Information Administration) is the non-partisan statistical arm of U.S. Department of Energy.  Most people would find the most of their site extremely boring.  <em>"I brake for <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/state_profiles/alabama/al.html">Alabama's nuclear power profile</a>."</em>

[caption id="" align="alignleft" width="110" caption="But can you deny the cuteness of ENERGY ANT?!"]<em><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/index.cfm"><img class="      " src="http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/images/energy_ant_poses.jpg" alt="" width="110" height="704" /></a></em>[/caption]
<p style="text-align: center;padding-left: 150px"><strong>But can you deny the cuteness of
ENERGY ANT?!</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px">That's right.  The EIA has an absolutely amazing kids website, complete with adorable mascot.  Their <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energy.cfm?page=nuclear_home-basics">nuclear page</a> starts off with an awesome picture of the Sun and is otherwise remarkably even-handed and informational.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px">However, my favorite page is by far <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energy.cfm?page=riddles">the interactive riddles</a>.  Welcome to my blog; welcome to puns I have stolen from children.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px"><strong>﻿Q:</strong> In which part of the jail are energy criminals kept?
<strong>A:</strong> The fuel cells!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px"><strong>Q:</strong> What did the solar cells say to their cloudy boss?
<strong>A:</strong> We need a rays!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 150px"><strong>Q:</strong> How do energy-conscious people feel about wind power?
<strong>A:</strong> They are blown away!</p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Enter Haiku:</strong></span>
<span style="font-size: 18px">Hark, Energy Ant,
</span><span style="font-size: 18px">Red statistical thorax,
You are so dreamy. </span>

<span style="font-size: medium"><span style="line-height: 32px">Ok kids, write your own energy ant haiku in the comments!</span></span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Having spent the past couple of days a the Fuel Cycle Research and Development meeting in Washington DC (Gaithersburg, MD really), there has been a lot of talk about the "Fuel Cycle Simulator Grand Challenge."

On the one hand this is very, very exciting.  It is an opportunity for the DoE to replace a system that doesn't work.  Or at the very least, it is a workflow that does not meet current and expected needs.  I have been saying this for years...

...Another thing I have been saying for years is that, 'Good science is good software development.'  Not everyone believes me; fine.  But if you are going to build out a huge code infrastructure you may as well give it the old college try.

I am fearful though.  They are calling it a 'Grand Challenge' because there exists this permeating belief that:
<ol>
	<li>Nuclear engineers are not software developers.</li>
	<li>This problem is hard.</li>
	<li>This problem is new.</li>
</ol>
At the heart of the proposed simulator is classic framework problem that is easily solved by a Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach with good test-driven development around the physical models.  And they are far from the first scientists to have a issue with storing and visualizing large amounts of data.

I am fearful because if they choose the wrong API now, it will have effects for years and years to come.  (Thankfully, from experience, they seem to recognize this.)

I am also fearful because they are talking about a three-year time frame just to build the framework and maybe some sample physics models*.  This is the easy part!  And every day that you spend debating whether you should be passing an array or a pointer to an array is a day that you are not doing new science and engineering**.

So I am excited because it truly is an excellent idea.  I am just not sure that it is as VISIONary as they make it out to be.  Give me three months, a coffee-shop, and  *BAM* you'll have the architecture that has been proposed.

The real grand challenge is making nuclear engineers into become software developers.

* Note: It may well take three years to put in meaningful models, but that is science not infrastructure.
** Note: I count views as new science, because without the shiny figure at the end, all you have is a bunch of numbers.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last Saturday, I was one of the ones privileged enough to be present at the 'Rally to Restore Fear and/or Sanity' in Washington DC.  It was more by providence that I went than specifically desiring to participating in a faux political event hosted by a cable television channel.

I was in the District, where people still don't have the right to vote, for of all things a Department of Energy meeting.  Is the irony leaking through this series of tubes yet?

Still, the rally was fun.  The show was entertaining enough; you can watch that online.  But from the steps of the National Gallery, the gathering was more about entertaining signage.

The event started out well with a poster stating:
<blockquote>Repeal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin's Law</a></blockquote>
And of course there was no shortage of the hard-to-disagree-with:
<blockquote>Only Hitler was Hitler</blockquote>
in apparent  reference to Glen Beck's penchant for declaring everyone he disagrees with a Nazi.  (So pervasive is his obsession that even <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/10/his_struggle?page=1">the Economist</a> takes heed.)

A similar truism was a giant piece of cardboard that must have been 5 x 7 feet, supported by PVC pipe, blocked everyone's view, and read:
<blockquote><span style="font-style: normal"><strong>Front:</strong></span> This Sign is Too Damn Big
<span style="font-style: normal"><strong>Back:</strong></span> BIG SIGN</blockquote>
There were more explicitly political ones in the mix as well.  Melding both poignancy and wit was a young woman who proudly exclaimed:
<blockquote>I Masturbate to Christine O'Donnell</blockquote>
Whatever floats your witch, lady...  (All the good ones seem to sink.  I feel cheated.)

However, the most righteous one was held by a (presumably) Saudi woman who was wearing a chromatic flower lei.  The sign itself had a quarter rainbow, starting and ending in clouds,  and stated:
<blockquote>God Loves Fags</blockquote>
I watched her take a picture flanked by two men who each had posters declaring
<blockquote>Don't Deport My Husband!</blockquote>
I wouldn't even think of it...  And lest you think that the rally itself was devoid of nerds, I found this gem in the trash outside of the Canadian embassy:
<blockquote>Americans for Gaussian Distributions</blockquote>
Now <em>that</em> is a platform I can get behind!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Discharge Reactivity of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Was Energy Ant was not technical enough for you?  Well, have I got a post for you...

The EIA, as mentioned before, houses monolithic databases on energy generation and consumption in this country.  One of them goes by the affectionate name Form RW-859 , or the Nuclear Fuel Data Survey.

Essentially, this database is a record of every fuel assembly to ever come out of a commercial nuclear reactor in the US.  It contains information such as where the fuel is being stored, if the fuel form failed, the mass of the assembly, and when the reactor was operating.  (Unfortunately, my version of the survey contains data only up until 2002, so I am missing eight years of history.)

However, good ol' RW-895 also contains some interesting neutronic data, such as the inital U-235 enrichment [w/o, weight percent] of each assembly as well as the burnup [MWd/kg].  In some sense, the enrichment is a measure of how much energy you <strong><em>expect</em></strong> to get out of the fuel and the burnup is a measure of how much energy you <strong><em>did</em></strong> get out of the fuel.

Using the above two pieces of information and my burnup-criticality model, <a href="http://nukestar.me.utexas.edu/scopatz/Bright/">Bright</a>, I calculated the isotopic composition and multiplication factor of every fuel assembly at discharge (the time when the fuel is permanently removed from the reactor).  This data was then stored in a couple of different databases: one for immediately after discharge and one for time 'now' in which the fuel was allowed to cool down since it was removed.

If you really want, you can take a peak at <a href="http://nukestar.me.utexas.edu/scopatz/FuelLearning/">my databases</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scopatz/FuelLearning">the code that generated them</a>. (As you may have guessed by the directory names here, this was done for a collaborator to try and apply machine learning algorithms to used fuel assemblies.)

Before I rant too much further, I should define the reactivity of a fuel assembly.  If 'k' is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_multiplication_factor">multiplication factor</a>, then the reactivity 'rho' is:

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\huge&amp;space;\rho&amp;space;=&amp;space;\frac{k-1}{k}" alt="" width="153" height="80" />Thus, reactivities greater than one mean that the fuel still has some 'juice' in it, while values less than one mean that the fuel has to rely on the sweet juice of other fuel elements.

If you are anything like me, you may idly wonder what the mass-weighted reactivity of the whole of the nuclear fuel cycle over the past 40 years has been.  This would give you, Oh Intuitive Reader, some idea of how efficient our system is at actually generating the energy it says it is going to.  Look. No. Further.

<strong>The mass-weighted average discharge reactivity is: ﻿﻿-0.1083</strong>

Great! The above number is negative.  If it was positive, this would be like throwing out batteries after only using them part way.

<em>"But how can this number be negative? Zero charge seems like it would be the lowest you could go..." </em> I hear your cries.  This is where the battery analogy falls apart.  The answer lies in the secret of batch-averaging, which deserves its own post.

But really, isn't the distribution of these reactivities useful to know too?  I can't deny you, Friendly Reader:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I could write about the election yesterday, or I could write about w00tstock 2.9...

Fine, this is sort of a serious kind of middle of the road sort of interactive web log-ish thing.  I'll do the pundit dance for you.

Basically, the election was a complete disaster...or was it?!  While not a sympathizer, I am a Tea Party empathizer.  Even the most liberal of publications, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/mid-term_madness">the Economist</a>, feels some amount of kinship:
<blockquote>...in how many other countries would a powerful populist movement demand less of government, rather than endlessly and expensively more?</blockquote>
There are legitimate problems in this country and people are genuinely upset at the dysfunctional incumbent government.  At its heart, the Tea Party is an anti-establishment movement.  Unfortunately for the rest of us, their platform falls off after this central point.

A long time supporter of third party solutions, I am pleased that <em>someone</em> other than the Republicans &amp; Democrats is doing well.  I just wish they offered actual solutions.  If not masturbating would solve poverty or keep people in their homes or implement a carbon tax, where do I sign up?!

Sadly, it is all hocus pocus witch is about as effective as Nazairte vows.  Instead, what we purchased with our vote is a House divided.  I doubt that health care reform can do much for this lame duck.

Even more disturbing than the ousted incumbents were the ones that remained in office.  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/03/nevada-election-results-2010_n_765994.html">Harry Reid kept his seat</a>, even though his environmental record <em>is not</em> a load of toxic nuclear waste!  And how in the hell did Rick Perry remain Governor of the great state of Texas?  He was basically caught embezzling from the State while simultaneously refusing to accept Federal stimulus money.  And dear lord, Jerry Brown.  I guess he isn't going to wholesale auction off California, but I am a firm believer in term limits.

But who cares?  Really?  When I wake up and peddle to work tomorrow, all I will see is a glorious bubble.  I live in Austin, <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austins-core-carried-bond-proposal-to-win-1019153.html">now with bike paths!</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of <a href="http://expositionhappeningnow.blogspot.com/">my friends</a> shared <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2010/11/another-thought-about-backscatter-machines/66751/">this item</a> sometime in the past week about the full-body scanners and backscatter x-ray machines at airports harming pregnant women.

I am all for women, and mostly for pregnancy.  But I am also for, you know, quantitative science and the lowly photon.  Here are some <em>fun facts</em> that we should all know.

The radiation dose you receive from full body scanners (0.005 - 0.01 mrem) is about ten thousand times less than want you experience on an annual basis just by living on Earth (360 mrem). Moreover it is 100 times less than your yearly dental x-rays (1 - 20 mrem). In fact, you will be subjected to a much higher radiation exposure on the plane flight itself than you receive by going through the scanner.

The real issue with these heinous machines is privacy, not safety (even to a fetus).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[...by which I mean <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/">WalkScore</a>.

The above website hosts a pretty neat app that lets you determine how 'walkable' your neighborhood is.  It is a great example of the kind of analysis that you can do when you have a huge amount of data available.  For instance, geolocation information on every bus route, bike path, park, and retail store in America.

<strong>However, the score that your home address gets is only as good as the algorithm applied to the database. </strong>

Since where I live gets a "Walker's Paradise" 91/100 score, I am inclined to believe in their methodology.  In fact, they claim that only 3% of Austinites live in a more walk-able part of town.  The only neighborhoods that beat me out are the University of Texas itself and Downtown.  It is no wonder I don't want to move...

However, the site also claims that Houston is more walkable than Austin, which is patently false.  So I am inclined to not believe their algorithm.

How I think that they came to this outrageous conclusion is that they count the number of walkable neighborhoods, not taking into account the percent of people or the area that these neighborhoods actually cover.  I think this is why LA also beats Houston.  Such huge metropolises may contain some very walkable areas, but as a whole they are impossible to traverse by foot.  This is not the case in Austin, even though it is a tenth of the size.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I first arrived in Houston a week and a half ago, my boss called it "the City that Oil built." I have experienced a strong correlation between such liquid markets, the willingness for people to live in underground tunnels, and the general lack of vegan options.

Downtown Houston is a weird place.  It never seems busy though one may saunter through the avenues framed by monolithic buildings.  The architecture is grandiose and diverse.  But you have to wonder who lives in these constructs if you are the only one on the street.

During the day, the city is teeming with life.  Like white blood cells they traverse the internal circulatory infrastructure.  Exiting the anonymous hall's glassy dermis for any length of time must be death for these oxygen-carrying modula.  Unless, of course, it is their smoke break.

I wish the clockwork city didn't checkout at 6 pm.  I like the night life, baby.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whether you know, or care, most database software has hard coded limits on the number of columns that you can store in a single table.

Often, if you hit this limit for some reason, it indicates that 'you are doing it wrong.'  However, this is not always the case.

For instance, say you want to store some information that is a function of isotope.  Well, exist some 3000+ nuclides that are known to exist in nature.  If you want to store this data in a single table and your database allows 4096 columns per table, you are in luck!  However, if you go down by a single power of two, there are only 2048 columns per table and you are in trouble.

Below is a list of different table structures and their implicit table limits:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/column-count-limit.html">MySQL 5</a>: 4,096</li>
	<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143432.aspx">MSSQL</a>: 1,024</li>
	<li><a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14237/limits003.htm">Oracle</a>: 1,000</li>
	<li><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/excel-specifications-and-limits-HP005199291.aspx">Excel 2003</a>: 256</li>
	<li><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/excel-specifications-and-limits-HP010073849.aspx">Excel 2007</a>: ﻿16,384</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/hdf5-quest.html#dtcmpmaxfld">HDF5</a>: ~1,260</li>
	<li>NumPy: +inf</li>
</ul>
That's right; NumPy structured (or record) arrays seem to allow as many columns as you can fit into memory!  Below is some code that demonstrates this.  I tested it up to a million columns, but I am certain that it could handle a few more orders of magnitude.

This situation is peculiar since traditional databases are limited by disk size, not memory, like NumPy.  (HDDs, of course, being much larger than RAM.)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of my friends this evening accused me of ragging on a certain religious/social organization more than any other as my go-to example group of damaging social fundamentalism.

I operate under an "Only intolerant to Intolerance", pluralistic mindset.  Thus decidedly voicing my opinion against fundamentalist everywhere comes up a fair bit.  The question that was posed was, "isn't it hypocritical for you to always be bringing up your dislike for group X?"

My answer was "No" for the following reason.  I don't actually dislike people in group X.  What I dislike is doctrine X (codified so we can all agree what the base text actually says), and that the text is largely adhered to by it's group, and that the text is a fundamentalist doctrine.

Now in every time, in every religion, there are fundamentalist sects. This is what I fight against in all of its expressions.  However when speaking to people, I tend to give my audience context based on their cultural background.

For White people in the US, you can typically say the Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses and these connote the respective doctrine that everyone is aware of.  Similarly, amongst Jews I use Hassids or the Ultra-Orthodox.  Pretty much everyone these days knows about al-Qaeda  and the Taliban.  Fewer know about the storied history of the Tamil Tigers or Shiv Sena.  Fewer still know of Buddhist fundamentalist sects in both Japan and Tibet*.

Maybe Mormons get a bad wrap in general for FLDS compounds in Texas.  And maybe Ultra-Orthodox Jews get a bad wrap because of Yigal Amir.  But if of all of the injustices in the world you only know about al-Qaeda, then this is the example I am going to rant to you about.  It is not that I disagree with the others any less.

It is fine, well, and good to condemn fundamentalism in general, but without concrete examples of what such belief systems do to people, it is much harder to make the case for the importance of acceptance and pluralism.

Perhaps I should be more general when speaking on such a sensitive topic, rather than trying to relate to my audience's  specific experiences.  If you repeatedly use the same example with the same audience it comes off the wrong way (ie hypocritical), even if you use different examples with different people.

So am I  a flaming bigot or in a subtle conundrum or somewhere in between? Thoughts?

* Obviously, I believe in people's right to practice the faith of their choice and raise their children in the manner that they see fit.  What I want people to desperately understand is what happens if their children don't fit the mold they as parents have prescribed for them.  I have seen loving families torn apart by this sad conundrum.  The naive romantic in me never wants to see this happen again.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Epistemology, Sexual Identity, &amp; Operating Systems</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been five weeks since my last post.  In general, they were not an easy five weeks, but <a href="http://hackerwithin.org/thw/">The Hacker Within</a> <a href="http://software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a> Bootcamp just wrapped up.  Thanks to all of the lovely, sexy, intelligent people involved!

Greg Wilson, of Software Carpentry, gave an amazing plenary session where he described the state of scientific computing.  The conclusion was that anecdotally things are very bad, because everyone believes that scientists are anywhere near as effective as they could be with computers.  (Let alone the number of computer scientists who can not develop software.)

Greg points out that things are worse than this because we are not even taking quantitative data about how far behind most people are.  Worse still, we largely don't know what the right metrics are, because measuring practical education level is hard.

So with out being too cynical, we don't know what we don't know <strong>and</strong> we don't know how to find out.  (There are some caveats, and things might be improving, but let's not be too hopeful.)  Greg (and now I, as well) hunger for quantitative data on this subject.  Philosophy plus experimentally determined numbers equals science, and now we are getting somewhere.

At the symphony tonight, this situation struck me as analogous to almost every issue I could dream up.  For instance, this has a fractal effect in science.  Say you measure the temperature, you don't really know the value unless it has some associated error (fractal depth: 1).  But then how are you sure that the error is correct (fractal depth: 2+).

Still, the most intriguing corollary is <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>sexual identity</strong></span> (or how one expresses one's self by who one is attracted to).

I cannot classify who I am attracted to.  No matter what I do, there always seems to be an exception to any rule I lay down.  (I'll spare you the juicy details.)  However, if you show me someone, or if I interact with someone, I can come up with a decision on whether the subject at hand 'does it' for me or not.  Moreover, I have no idea how to go about determining a suitable sexy-to-Anthony metric, since all prior attempts have failed.  The concept seems fuzzy.

So similarly, to a software developer, give me a person and their code and I can tell you if I think they are good or not.  Yet, I find the abstract task hard, unsatisfying, and probably a waste of time.

Let's take the sexual identity analogy one step further.  If we were to sex operating systems, we would probably say that Windows more male, and Mac OS X is more female. Of course, what we are doing here is actually making a woman/man gender assignment.

<strong>This makes Linux transgendered!</strong>

Unfortunately, the analogy breaks down when you start to talk about solutions in these two spaces.  Gender bias probably won't be solved (in the short term) simply by decreasing the market share of the major players.  Additionally, unless you are Richard Stallman, you aren't just born an open-source-sexual.

I think most people are forced to believe simply because it collapses their information entropy to zero.  Sadly, I don't know how to break them of this habit, or even if I should.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/1/28/uprising_in_egypt_this_is_the">Shit has gotten real in Egypt.</a>

The typical commentary about democracy, Tunisia, Wikileaks, and ElBaradei (a personal hero of mine) is available elsewhere.  Here I will try to give you the anarcho-cyber-feminist take.

The revolution should succeed for all of the reasons people generally think that it should (populist, anti-corruption, public empowerment).  Moreover, the reasons people generally feel that it should fail (instability, lack of a powerful replacement, uncertain postpartum relations with the US and Israel, formation of religious rather than secular state) are quickly disappearing.

However, what is striking about affair from an information age perspective is not what inspired the demonstrations or how the government tried to prevent them.  What is absolutely incredible is that despite the government's attempt to create a digital wasteland in their own country, they have effectively failed.

It is true that large swaths of the people do not have internet or mobile access.  But even if 1 in 1000 people figure out a way to semi-consistently, tweet this appears to be enough.  News is flowing into, out of, and internally to the country.

Consider if the same thing were to happen in the US, where the populous is generally more technically capable.  The degree of revolutionary organization would likely be much higher.  The road to revolution is likely paved with ham radios and shadow networks.  It is a historical irony that the US military's gift to the world of TCP/IP is now being used in an open source way as a tool against another government's regime.

As with every revolution, both the replaced and the revolutionary must question what the overthrow buys.  Was the pain worth the price?

If one looks at gender relations in Egypt (not a subject on which I am an expert), I do not think that much will change.  The suffrage proof is in the suffering's pudding.  In all of the footage I have not seen a single female protester.

This is not to say that there are not any, or perhaps maybe I simply missed them.  Still, this is an Egyptian man's revolution.   Naturally, I don't claim to understand all of the subtleties going on here.  (Maybe mothers are urging their sons to go out and protest...)  Relatively speaking, Egypt has been fairly progressive on women's rights.  Thus a male-lead revolution is cause for concern.  I doubt that the Egyptians social policy will regress.  However, I am not holding out hope for vast improvements coming out of recent events either.

Contrast Egypt with imagery from the Tunisian revolution where women are clearly present.  This discrepancy may be due to the Egyptian situation, by all accounts, being more dangerous and the police using greater amounts of force.  Still, history shows that agency is something that one must fight for.  Though I can not rightly say what I would do if I were an Egyptian woman, I urge them all to go out and get while the getting is good!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was recently in a position where I adopted a gender role I was rather uncomfortable with.  The reason I went along with it initially was in an attempt to create a better community for future generations.  For various reasons, I do not feel comfortable airing my feelings on that thread.

However, I try to live an open life so I am going to make a post about <strong>my actual beliefs</strong> here.

I feel like our whole model of gender and the non-biological-imperative parts of sexuality is wrong.  Moreover, I think we should replace it.  Or at least we should take a serious stab at experimenting with replacing it.  This opinion was likely formed somewhere between my strongly second-wave mother, Carl Djerassi, and Ursala K. Le Guin.  "<em>Kemmer is one honking great idea, let's do more of that!</em>"

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Context:</span></strong> The reason I am 'male' is for much the same as the reason I am (ethnically) Jewish.  Other people define me as this way.  I could contest these external labels, but it would not really matter.  In a keenly post-WWII life, my personal sense of self holds little weight to the misconceptions of others.

Yes, there are implications for being born biologically male-bodied.  These are issues which my doctor should worry about.  However, I do not feel particularly 'man'-ish nor do I like what that implies.

If I had a choice, I would not have been male.  Not that I would have chosen female, either.  I just want to be human damn it!*

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Innovations:</span></strong> Technology is becoming available that promises to mitigate some of the confines of sex-of-birth.  <strong>In the long term what I would love to see is the ability for one to change one's physical sex as easily as one might change a shirt, into and out of as many sexes as their are articles of clothing in a wardrobe</strong>.

I anecdotally believe that this would necessitate a successful replacement to our current, failed gender and sex model.  In order to accomplish such a heady goal I advocate a many-stage series of experiments to test, and learn from, different scenarios.

In the near term, <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090127090732.htm">products</a> will likely become available that allow same-sex couples to bio-techno-logically reproduce.   I think we should actively experiment with homogeneously sexed** communities.  Individuals would be free to enter and leave such communities at will.

This in turn might open the door for asexual, reproductively-capable groups.  Lessons learned here could be applied to groups of switchable sexed communities.  Basically, as technology improves, we will be able to perform a greater variety of experiments.

Paramount here is that we should treat these as hard science experiments rather than social ones.  Yes, there are social goals (as there always are in science), but the methods should be rigorous.

As I and most other multi-celled organisms will freely admit, the biological ability to swap genetic material with a partner has been shown to be the correct way of doing things.  Yet since we have already freed ourselves from the shackles of traditional natural selection, we may as well take this opportunity as a species to truly innovate.

<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Paradoxes:</strong></span> It is generally considered a good thing to talk about getting more women into science and engineering. However, in order to even have this conversation I have had to abandon all of the scruples I have laid out above.  In the face of reality, I have forcibly applied labels ('female', 'male') to others that I do not want applied to myself.

Additionally, some people claim that affirmative action is bad because the under-represented individual might wonder "Did I get this position because I was truly qualified or because I am a XXX?"   However, I claim that the status quo or the lack of affirmative action is equally bad because I constantly wonder "Did I get this position because I am truly qualified or because I happen to have a circumcised penis**?"  I struggle with this daily.

The above two paradoxes are the clearest thought experiments that I have which demonstrate that humans are clearly still thinking about issues of gender and sexuality (let alone ethnicity) in the wrong way.  Transformative measures seem to need to be taken to meaningfully resolve these quandaries***.

---

* Similarly, the Jewish situation is muddled.  While I am a Jew-by-choice religiously, I have no internal compass that makes me ethnically Jewish.  I am ethnically Jewish because other people have a mental construct which the forcibly apply to me.

** You tell me I am Jewish and male.  Clearly you have put this much together.

*** In the very near term, I am also in favor of escapist romps in the metaverse that allow people a degree of gender self-expression and innovation without the messy biology.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Viveck Wadhwa posted an <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/26/friends-don%E2%80%99t-let-friends-get-into-finance/">interesting article</a> today over at Tech Crunch that was linked on <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/11/03/27/1412259/Friends-Dont-Let-Geek-Friends-Work-In-Finance">slashdot</a> entitled "<em>Friends Don't Let Geek Friends Work in Finance</em>."  I'd like to take a moment to explain why the article has largely missed the mark.  First off in full disclosure, about 4 months ago I started on a project for a financial client at work.  However, as a consultant, I am not receiving the huge payout that other engineers who delve into finance see.

The article describes the financial industry as 'poaching' top scientists and engineers to work for them rather 'solving the worlds problems.'   This is ridiculous for a couple of reasons.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Smart People Like to Work on Interesting Problems</span></h3>
The above may seem self evident, but it bears repeating.  There are some really interesting problems in finance that most people who are not quants would never know about.  Moreover, they are interesting problems that scientists and engineers are familiar with.  It is eerie how similar Black-Scholes is to the neutron diffusion equation.  It is like an old friend with a lime in it; what a twist!

Additionally, as an academic, if you feel like you can enter a space where you have a competitive advantage than you take that opportunity to make a name for yourself.  Finance has a lot of room for tried and true methods from other fields.  If you can apply one of these methods you learned during the course of your study and become the thing since securitized bread, you might just do so.

Couple the interesting problem and higher fame above with a higher pay grade and it is not surprising that scientist and engineers want to go into these economics.  Far from being poached, I think the mindset makes a lot of sense.  Or at least it is understandable.  If you ignore that scientists are human, then you have missed a critical point in your analysis.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Moral Hazard is the Same</span></h3>
This may come as a surprise to many people given the current discourse, but science and engineering are no more ethical as disciplines than finance.  Everyday engineers are paid to build and design weapons of mass destruction, or attack drones to kill children in other lands, or missiles to topple governments, or engines to kill the Earth slowly.  (For this discussion we will ignore the "Cars are murder!" argument.)  Richard Feynman was responsible for the deaths of many people.  Alexander Kalashnikov was responsible for far more.  In addition to better toaster ovens, these are also the legacy of science and engineering.

This is not to say that science has not improved our lives in a million ways great and small.  But in spite of the havoc the finance industry has wrought recently, they also improve our lives in many ways.

One is hard pressed to debate the merits of being able to borrow and loan money.  It turns out to be a very useful thing.  For centuries it was illegal (see usury).  The liberation of trade (within limits, can't have robber-barons now can we?)  has made the past 200-300 years some the most productive ever.  Trading in risk (insurance) turns out to be even more useful.  Scientists have certainly benefited from this structure more so than most people.

Yes, you can and should debate the relative merits of CDOs, or rating agencies.  But keep in mind that time and again, scientists and engineers have shown an extreme amorality towards their work.  Moreover, hating bankers for being bankers perpetuates moral arguments outlined in the Bible which have historically been used to justify racism.  Instead I urge you to please talk about the specific technical issues at hand.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline">Obvious Conclusion</span></h3>
<strong>If more people are going into the finance, and if financial jobs pay better, it is because this work is more valued by our society.</strong> If you think that this makes our society morally bankrupt, I'd tend to agree.  If you want change society for the better, I am right behind you.  Let's really put science and engineering in its rightful place.  Let's also put banking and corporations in their rightful place as well.  The whole system <em>should be</em> designed to improve the lives of people, not to perpetuate abstract hierarchies.  Such are the principals our nation was founded on.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>t'asoiaf';dr - I am moving to Chicago.</strong>

Dear Ser Erick,

Upon forging my chain and becoming a maester in mine own right, I regret to inform you that cannot remain in your leal service.  My time spent in study in these southron lands must come to an end.  I have heard the call; the realms need me.

I have decided to take the black.  The Wall needs as much support as it can muster.  Maesters are in short supply to help fight back the dread things stirring in the uncivilized lands to the north.  I will enter the ranks as a steward to research the coming troubles.  Castle Black has excellent resources and premier library.  However, it is my understanding that I will spend much of my time in the Gift, on the Wall's southside, on a plain known as Hyde Park.

Please wish me good tidings in this venture.  I know I had planned to stay within this kingdom for many more years, but the shifting sands of fate conspire to place me elsewhere.

Health &amp; Wealth,
Maester Skopes]]></content:encoded>

The problem is that there is so much awesomeness going on right now that I can't keep up.
<ol>
	<li>I finally moved into the co-op.  My mind seems to explode with every conversation.  It is exhausting.</li>
	<li>I get to meet all sorts of cool people at work in the High Energy Density Physics community.  I am not sure I can keep up.</li>
	<li>I get to talk about scientific computing to everyone I meet.  Bootcamps here I come.  Dammit, more work.</li>
	<li>I am writing my first grant proposal to DOE.  My brain has fractured.</li>
	<li>Something secret I can't talk about that will take a lot of focus.</li>
	<li>I am reading "The Nibelungenlied."  As a connoisseur of epic poetry, I am thoroughly impressed by this translation.  I have been writing couplets because of it.</li>
</ol>
Not to say that everything in life is going perfectly, but all of this has left me in a catatonic state of saturation.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify">Two nights ago I went to <a href="http://epic.uchicago.edu/">EPIC</a> (Energy Policy Institute at Chicago) and saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Inglis">Congressman Bob Inglis</a> (R, South Carolina) give a talk.  The congressman has a very interesting recent history in the public sphere.  In the elections in 2010, he was the incumbent who was defeated in the primary by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Gowdy">Congressman Trey Gowdy</a> for not being "Republican" enough despite his rather conservative background.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">What likely tipped the balance was his stance on climate change.  Unlike the less empirical arm of his party, Congress Inglis believes both that global climate change is occurring and that it is being caused by human activity.  Spurred to action he co-authored a bill to institute a carbon tax, which obviously was never passed into law.  The bill had three important features:</p>

<ol style="text-align: justify">
	<li>Stop all federal subsidies for electricity generation,</li>
	<li>Lower payroll taxes...</li>
	<li>...and instead institute a carbon tax by the corresponding amount (revenue neutral).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify">The carbon tax would start at $15 / ton of Carbon and be raised to $100 / ton over the next 100 years.  (Carbon effects are typically priced at $30-50 / ton.)  Of note is that this strategy <strong>permanently</strong> lowers taxes as we (presumably) move away from carbon-based technologies and the payroll taxes are not replaced.  That Bob Inglis was ousted from the Republicans on behalf of this bill is nothing short of ironic.</p>

<div>
<p style="text-align: justify">I had the pleasure to speak with the congressman semi-privately in a breakout session after the workshop.  While most of his talk was about how to convince people you need to communicate with them on a one-on-one basis and appeal to "their hearts, not their heads, " I was more interested in specifics of his proposal.  (Note: he was at EPIC in part to drum up support over the long term for this bill.)  One important point that was brought up in the meeting was that the abolition of subsidies might place an undo burden on the poor.  Those on marginal incomes often rely on cheap oil and gas for basic survival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Still, there were two nuclear specific issues that I think have to be dealt with in this context.   First is the ever-present waste issue.   The Department of Energy (DOE) has the legal obligation to manage and dispose of all of the legacy waste.  It would be foolhardy to believe that a carbon tax bill would somehow change this.  However, just a smoke &amp; mirrors threat to the status quo could be fearful enough to turn many people against the bill.  The congressman seemed to think that this was a non-issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The second technical question I had, for which there was no answer by the congressman, was what exactly was meant by subsidies.  It was well understood that direct, monetary subsidies would be eliminated.  But what of indirect subsidy-like instruments such as the federal loan guarantees for new nuclear power plants.  Arguably no new nuclear plants would be built if the insurance companies themselves were not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  It doesn't help that the mortgage crisis and the collapse of the global economy has put into view what happens when such guarantees are called upon.  It puts the industry in a troubling situation whether the loan guarantees stay or go.  It would either be special treatment or impossible to fund new projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The last interesting point was that he served on the Committee on Science and Technology during the formation of the Blue Ribbon Commission.  Naturally, I asked him about their findings.  He did remember the hearings on the topic but his general impression was that it was to appease the electorate of Senator Harry Reid.  This aligns well with my general view of the BRC situation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the end, I agree with the Congressman's tax plan as a generally good idea.  Still, there are clearly some provisions to be hammered out and the devil is always sneaking around the details.</p>
