Ok so I just got back from LA. Fun times all around. I could go into
more detail but I really don't feel like it. Well, Ok I saw Lydia and
Andrew and Meenon and Maggie and Paul Krassner and Roy Zimmerman.
However,....<br><br>Let
me reiterate. This is a Private Journal. It is strictly read at your
own risk. I started it on the recomendation of my therapist. I tried
writing in a private hand-written one. Didin't work. It is easiest to
type here. This journal is written with one and only one audiance in
mind: Dr. Wax. If you are not Dr. Wax or are not mature enough to be a
pure Voyer then I urge you to stop reading. It will only hurt you. <br><br>This
IS MY space to let out my inner psyche. A lot of what I say here is
categorecally false. Most of this blog is a knee-jerk reaction. I first
response. Through reading "Please Understand Me", I understand that a
lot (about 40%) of people can only have a knee-jerk response. I am
capable of more as are most of my friends. If you feel uncomfortable
about this site, understand that this is NOt how I necessarily feel or
think about people. Only what I think. Would you dare venture into the
inner workings of anothers mind? Do you even think about yours? <br><br>This
takes a skilled proffesional, of which I am not. However I am being
introspective and am thinking about my thoughts and this helps. <br><br>NO ONE IS FUCKING SAFE HERE!!!! THIS MEANS YOU!!!! GET THE FUCK OUT!!!<br><br>Brendan, Jon, Kerry, If this journal is too disruptive to you and your life I beg of you do not read.  <br><br>Syd,
This ceratinly was not intended for you. But am I suppossed to
apologize because you snuck into my closet and think my dity closes
smell? I think not. Besides it is impossible to determine who soiled
this landaury in the first place. Whoever pointed you here, if they did
so knowing you are an introvert, then they only did so to hurt you. If
this was me, then it is pretty obvious that some part of me wants to
hurt you and this FUCKING Journal is how I control it. What do you want
from me..to join a convent. Do you really want me to physically attack
you or dan? I don't. Give me some outlet and stop torturing me by
trying to change me into you without giving back at all! If you are
upset abou the emails, know they were for my therapist. Oh wait...a
holier than thou moment coming....At least I don't involve any friends
in a relationship who can be affected by it. This may be an exageration
but..."Hmmm Dan, should I break up with Tony and instead suck YOUR
cock?" Dan may have the capasity to be rational but he still thinks
with his dick and not his head or heart.<br><br>I would like everyone
to please note that I have never, ever said an unkind word about Syd or
Dan. To me only actions count. This is MY stream of conciousness..not
yours. This does not count as an action anymore than thinking these
thoughts and keepeing them bottled up or telling Dr. Wax. <br><br>Whenever
anyone has ever said "Syd, what a bitch" or "Oh I used to like Dan" I
have always defended you two. I have always encouraged my friends to
come to their own conclutions and Know that I, despite everything,
wanted to remain their friend. If truly pressured I have always told
the truth, which is that I feel betrayed by both but for some dumb
reason I still feel Syd has value in my life. Even now; this very
moment.<br><br>I know that my thoughts if ever expressed would only
drive Syd and Dan Closer. Watch as it does. What did I do to desvere
such total and utter rejection from two who once called me friend? To
my mind, very little. To express such thoughts is not publiclly
acceptable. As intimate as two people get, it is still public. This,
fortunately is not the public in any local sense<br><br>It interests me
that Syd would suddenly, after I broke off contact with her, be
interested in how I am thinking. For the last year and a half of our
relationship she showed no inkling or care at all to what I was
thinking or even how I was feeling. Wanting to be alone in my grief di
not mean that I didn't love her and she was wrong to think so. If you
are still reading then It means you are a Voyer and I hold no duty to
you. I feel no social kindness to not offend. This is my mind and not
yours.<br><br>I realize that things I associate in my mind with Syd and
Dan still hold value apart from them. I hope they do the same. I also
understand that I inherited the Dan curse and can only pray it has run
its course. I fear that with this speci-man it has only just begun.<br><br>However, I have rejected the more nerdy activities which make them such losers now.<br><br>Syd
would only make such an incendiary post about me on her live journal if
she still cared about me in some manner. Clearly the number of posts on
mine about her indicates that I still care about her. I think a lot of
her anger comes out of her being rejected by me. She had yet to be
dumped. Now she in some small faction knows how it feels. What must
really kill her about all this is that I haven't gone off the deepend
and called her anything crazy like a "pedophile". I really did cut off
contact with her because I felt it was in my emotional best interest,
which is something akin to why she broke up with me and started going
out with Dan. Life works in mysteroious ways.<br><br>Self-Referential
of the day: Posting about how stupid it makes a person when they have a
Holier-than-thou post, makes your post Holier-Than-Thou and thus you
just as stupid.</td></tr>

Well, I did it.  It was hard to do, but easier than expected.<br><br>I
told Syd in not so many words that I don't think we can be friends
right now. What I actually said was more along the lines of "I think it
is in my best interest if we stop contacting each other." We made it
through the rest of lunch without any arguments or screaming or crying.
She thought the Picture I painted for her yesterday with me in a rocket
going to mars was about LA. Little did she know. <br><br>For a while
now everyone from Shawn to Dr. Wax to Tara has been saying that it
would be good for me to cut off contact. This realization came slowly
to me. Ultimately it is that Syd did not start treating me any better
after the breakup. Instead she still wanted me to think well of her no
matter how she treated me. I was not game for that in our relationship
and I reacted by being apathetic towards her when she did that. Oddly
that apathy was her main reason for ending our relationship. Now
however it was my turn to end the relationship because of her
distateful behavior. This behavior essentially is that she was treating
me as an EX and not a friend. She would purposelfy (consious of it or
no) bring up sensitive topics and anger me. It was always a crapshoot
as to whether she would treat me well on a given day or not, both in
and out of our reltionship. <br><br>This all started because she could
not, can not (and this may be a function of her personality type more
than anything, which is why I hold out hope for the future that she
will settle down and stablize in one personality type and be able to
accept that rather than being internally torn), treat me as an equal.
She could NOT accept the fact that I was depressed about my family, I
knew I was depressed, and she could not trust me when I said I knew how
to work it out on my own but that I also just needed her faithful
support not her advice. For some unknown reason this pissed off her
inner psyche and she still doesn't know what to do with me.<br><br>Like
Sean or Garrick or Nick or Meenon or Josh (Noel) or Mowi&amp;Kai, Syd
is family. I feel like my mom must have felt about Shane after he
turned them into Child Protective Services. In the end, I think
everything will work out, but I have done all that I can for now. For
whatever reason, Syd has rejected me. There is nothing I can safely do
but give her the rejection she so desires.<br><br>I fell bad about this.  On the other hand, now I am truly single....Hellooooo Ladies!</td></tr>

the SB crowd has started to find out about this journal. This will be
interesting. Brendan told me today that he had found it (because I
added him as a friend). He described it as "intense". I should have
said "Well, Brendan, it is because I am an intense guy! LOL!" I didn't
think of it at the time though ^_^. Instead I told him the truth, which
is that I use this as an outlet for my Vox which is not socially

I went down town again last night with Shawn. At about 11.00 things
became rather decadent for me and I wanted to leave but for Shawn's
sake we stayed longer. I was the designated driver. Things just aren't
the same if you are not drinking and you only have the one friend who
is running off with others all the time. I didn't really mind though. I
wanted to meet Shawn's friend Ed, who turns out to be quite the

Ok so I disappered for a few days and I realized that my previous post indicated none of where or why I went.<br><br><br>Ok
so I was really flustered and after the bullshit of last week so I went
to visit my cousin Andrew and the whole (or what is left) crowd from
the Valley. Here was the beautiful thing about this weekend I only made
two decitions the whole time, when I was to arrive and when I was to
leave. On this trip I really only didn't see Racheal (and Other Andrew
of course). I didn't see Kai for as long as I'd like since he was
working. I did get to where this bitchin' Cowboy hat of Mowi's though.
Mowi and Kai now have these three adorable kittens. I love these
people. They are really my friends. I know that they have polotiks
within themselves and I am thankfully not a part of that. However I
feel that even if I was a less transitory member of their friend group
I would still manage to stay mostly out of it. The clear comparriosn I
am making here is Morgan Hill. While I may date someone, I will be the
first and then not terribly embroiled after all is said and done. I
still manage to be a part of them though. I feel I am a trusted friend
of all of them. Andrew and I tend to satisfy the same social niche even
though we have very different life styles. The proximity of our
birthdays (no accident by the way) only enhances the mood that I am
some sort of twin who was seperated. I got to see Josh for a good bit
which is good. He made the hard choice of taking off school to help his
family while his mom recovers from cancer. I am so proud/envious. I
wish I could have made a similar choice. Of coruse, my families
problems were a bit more insidous in terms of timelines of information.
I also saw Eric. He is a great person too. So at one point it was Eric,
Andrew, Josh and I hanging out and I realized that, on some level, we
were all Jewish. Thus the kabalists. <br><br>I met Andrew 3 or Other
Other Andrew. Seems like an ok guy. He is going to Cal Poly in Physics.
That kinda took me by suprise. Up to then he seemed like the
sterotypical Valley nerd-dork (whole different breed than NorCal trust
me guys...I've lived both lives). Andrew was noticibly bitter...as well
he should be, but then why invite them to the movie if it would just
upset you. Once again, I feel trapped into having to let my less
experianced friends make their own dumb relationship mistakes.<br><br>Meanwhile,
I realized that, escpecially if I move to TexAss, no one else I ever
meet will meet as my childhood friends. Syd was around long enough to
meet them all basiclly. I had some shitty flashbacks to going down to
the valley with her and Dan. I tried to escape, but escaping into my
past present and future didn't work. Those two are fucking persistent.
Just like family.<br><br>And Next weekend I do it all again!  Isn't life quaint.</td></tr>

So Yesterday when I woke up I was Graduating but not doing comencement.  Today I am now doing comencement but not graduating.  <br><br>Stupid System; Stupid Man.<br><br>I
have two blocks on my graduation. The first is that I need to petition
for the physics department to accept 8 units of Upper division Math for
the physics elecive courses. No biggie really (I think) as they already
said they would. The other is this really dumb thing where we have this
writing requirement which means that we have to take 6 classes off of a
dumb list which count as writing classes. I made the mistake of
believing that the classes I took from the Writing Department would
count towards this. Nope. I only have 5 of the six classes. LAAAAME! So
now I have to petion for some of my Physics lab classes, which have had
an extensive amount of writing in them, to count for this. Almost all
of them work except for this fuzzy 25% of the grade clause. In any
event I am hoping that saying hey I have grad school to go to and so
summer is not an option and at least one of these three classes totally
satisfies your needs and hey NO class in my major is on you stupid list
will have them count one of the classes for me. <br><br>If this doesn't happen then I am basiclly screwed.  I just wanna get outta here on time...is that so much to ask?</td></tr>

So I am sitting here at a terminal in the library. It is superbly
beautiful day and I feel well dressed. Perhaps a little too warmly for
this weather. I hope I get to go to Irvine this weekend. Since Other
Andrew can't make it out we are looking for alternitive ways to have
fun. With Andrew, of course, this means exploring my more nerdy
pursuits. In all likely hood I will end up raiding with the guild and
then playing some DnD. This might be a nice change of pace for me.
Also, it means I get to see Mowi and seriously, how many more times am
I gonna get to do that. <br><br>There
is some weird Abortion campaing goingon outside. I am not really sure
what there deal is, but I now know I have an instictual reation to run
when I see a seven foot tall fetus.<br><br>I think I may have relapsed
into caring about the Dan-Syd thing which is bad. This morning was
tough after it hadn't been bad for a couple of weeks. It wasn't that
bad but I gotta nip it in the bud now. <br><br>Other than that there
is a lot of stress in school right now. Not really in my classes but
more involved with getting out of them. At this point my classes are a
drop in the bucket for the rest of the quarter. However, They are doing
my final requirement check today and I'll know tomorrow one way or the
other whether I get to graduate for sure or not. In addition to that,
even though the deadline is next week, I am not able to register for
comencement online. This is bad because it might mean that even though
I will get a degree saying I can talk the talk they might not let me
walk the walk. The people are real slimeballs about it too, just like
ETS or the College Board. Their website, The Office of Student Events,
only lists their phone number (which leads only to an answering
machine), an email (which no one checks), and a mailing address (which
on a university campus has no relation to the actual location). They
literally make it impossible for you to walk in and ask a quick
question. Brilliantly, however, after visiting the Registar today I
popped by the Visitor's Centor on campus and asked them. It turns out
the office isn't even on Campus!!! It is at an off campus research
center, WTF! I didn't have time to go to my car and go there today but
I will tomorrow. If they don't listen to my pleas of "I paid $100K to
go here, let me walk in the silly ceremony. How many years have you
been doing this again?" Then I will get my parents (who actually did
pay the 100K) to go in and do the same. It really is the only way
things get done around here. Or in this case, it is the only way things
get done NOT around here.</td></tr>

Here is the latest installment of the DLG-emails. I fera I amy have
been too harsh, howver I don't think I said anything half as harsh as I
have posted on this blog.<br><br><br>Syd:<br>dear tone<br> <br>hmmm now i want to see trigun all the more. <br>as
tired as i was last night some part of me thought i missed the thrill
of RP in between the wispy corners of sleepiness and the jagged edges
of ow-my-tummy.<br>i understand what you are saying about not being
able to distinguish between the pains of the situation and the sadness
of leaving in the first place. i have been thinking so much about that
lately...i so sorely hope to continue to see people into the summer...<br>i
do, however, continue to think of it as my responsibility. if only i
had been more in touch with my feelings and more realistic we might
have effected a much healthier separation. and if i had had the
self-control to keep my feelings for He who must not be named a secret
for a few months none of this pain and suffering would have
happened--except of course for the pain and suffering of
leaving/graduating... <br>i am not sure that the solution you hinted
at will ever occur to him, however, especially since he is aware of how
much you seem to prefer avoidance. he would probably feel bad
contacting you even in an apologetic vein. and i do not think it will
occur to him to apologize--i think he has a strong impression of our
relationship having been pretty painful for me as he was always there
in your room when you gave me the cold shoulder and of course never
there at the moments of our greatest intimacy. so you have to realize
that to a certain extent he usually saw us acting unhappily. if this,
my estimation, is an accurate one of his mindset (and who knows) then
he probably thinks that *you* should apologize instead. maybe I should
tell him that both you and i have apoligized to each other and then he
would understand the complexity of the situation. tell me what you
think about this please--i won't make any move until we've discussed it.<br> <br>I guess he was at DLG when he thought you were in lab.  he will make a more concerted effort about that if you like.<br> <br>i'm glad i saw you today...<br>baci,<br><br>Tony:<br>Dear Syd, My Response:<br><br>"
i do, however, continue to think of it as my responsibility. if only i
had been more in touch with my feelings and more realistic we might
have effected a much healthier separation. and if i had had the
self-control to keep my feelings for He who must not be named a secret
for a few months none of this pain and suffering would have
happened--except of course for the pain and suffering of
leaving/graduating... "<br><br><br>This is why I am upset at you. This
was the one condition of having a reltionship with me that you
violated. You kept it a secret. You lied (includes withholding key
information) about at it to my face. I have, arguably, been through
more relationships than the entire rest of our friend group
(discounting Shawn if you count one night stands). I made it very clear
(I thought) at the beggining that if you were ever thinking about a
relationship with someone else, I would need to be told about it. This
was the opposite of what happened and what had been going on for many
months I suspect. I do not feel bad, therefore for doing the same to
you. However, I may have saved the relationship by telling you but all
things considered I doubt that. He who shall not be named lied many
times to me as well. This only adds to my anger against him. It is one
thing to commit a dishonorabl act, it is another yet again to conceal
it. People in my situation are not stupid. Treating us as such only
makes the situation worse. But we live and learn and my hope is that
you won't be epimethian for the rest of your life.<br> <br><br>" i am
not sure that the solution you hinted at will ever occur to him,
however, especially since he is aware of how much you seem to prefer
avoidance. he would probably feel bad contacting you even in an
apologetic vein. and i do not think it will occur to him to
apologize--i think he has a strong impression of our relationship
having been pretty painful for me as he was always there in your room
when you gave me the cold shoulder and of course never there at the
moments of our greatest intimacy. so you have to realize that to a
certain extent he usually saw us acting unhappily. if this, my
estimation, is an accurate one of his mindset (and who knows) then he
probably thinks that *you* should apologize instead."<br><br><br>Of
course, he has to deface me so that I am less than who I am so that he
may justify in his mind the actions which he has committed. In effect,
he became not my friend so that he could get a quick lay and not feel
bad about it. Also, as much as I hated it coming from your mouth you
were right we never were friends in any traditional sense. Even when I
was noticlby feeling bad he would never approcah me and ask if every
thing was alright (as even a moderate friend would). Even, at your
prompting, when I would tell him things with out being asked he would
shrug them off and offer no support and be generally very cold about
it. I let sleeping dofs lie, and figured that he simply did not what to
get involved. I however made the mistake that he was an actual friend.
How many years has this man been apathetic towards me...waiting. How
much do you wanna bet that he didn't apply to Grad school hoping that I
would leave just so he could interject himself into your pants. <br><br>I
am a good person and have done him no wrong, and have done no wrong to
you that was not the result of a mutual disagreement (for which as you
have pointed out we have already both apologized for).<br><br>I believe
he does not understand some pretty basic things about relationships,
such as not butting into others business and that they are all
categorically painful. Even my relationship with Kerry V., which
was the most casual and whimsical one to date, hurt me and her deeply I
am sure.<br><br>The oint of this is that if he is too blind or scared
to apologize and try to make amends then that means to me that he must
not want to. One of the central things we agree on, philisophically you
and I, is what I label as existentialism. Really, only actions count to
me. If he wants to apologize it will not count unless he does. I did
not make this situation, I will not be the one to unmake it any further
than I already have. <br><br>I am not the type of bitch to bend over
and take it in the ass when my friends abandon/hurt me. I get the Fuck
out. I have seen to many of my other friends destroyed by hanging
around too long. At this point I could care less about how he feels. I
hope you understand<br><br><br>" maybe I should tell him that both you
and i have apoligized to each other and then he would understand the
complexity of the situation. tell me what you think about this
please--i won't make any move until we've discussed it. "<br><br><br>He
was not/is not in our relationship. Do not overstep your boundries.
Doing this would ruin any chance of ever having a resolution. My terms
are that he does not get specific guidance in this matter, and the only
person you control is yourself. Also, I do not kiss and tell, I would
prefer you do the same. I.E. if you repsect me at all, do not discuss
our relationship in any detail with any future partners. I deserve my
privacy. General situation ok, but he hardly needs that.<br><br>"    I guess he was at DLG when he thought you were in lab.  he will make a more concerted effort about that if you like. "<br><br><br>That
is either an outright lie or an oversight. He KNOWS that lab is never
held on friday for either section. All that I ask in this last month of
Hell that I have here on campus is for me to never have to see his ugly
mug again, at least until such a time as some resoultion can be
confered, at which point the subject is once again open. <br><br>I
should be able to be free to eat at DLG anytime I wish, just as he is
free to eat at Carrillo any time he wishes without me showing up to
piss him off. I want to be gentelmanly about this. He is not to eat at
DLG again, period. I shall not eat at Carrillo, it is really that
simple. Another observed violation and my methods for broaching the
subjcet will be more direct.<br><br>"    i'm glad i saw you today..."<br><br><br><br>Me too! I hope to see yo at some point this week before the weekend.<br><br>I
am sorry If this letter was a bit harsh. I really don't like talking
about it, but the whole DLG thing brouhgt it up again. I apologize for
the severity, but I assure you it is not one hundredth as severe as I
feel. I am sure teh same goes all around. It is funny how we mask our
feeling to get through the day. Reminds me of Los Banos or Lancaster
for some reason.<br><br>Be Well<br>Anthony</td></tr>

Ok, instead of bitchin' about how much I hate Dan and how much of a
Pussy he is for taking advantage of the closest slutty girl he could
find, instead of illustrating the multitude of ways I would like to
find him at graduation with his parents and scream "Fuck You, I hope
your dick rots off and your mom eats it in front of you and you know
what she enjoys the tatse...too bad it is a one time thing!" Instead of
this I will post some of the email conversation that Syd and I have
been having.<br><br><br>Me:<br>Hey All,<br><br>We
will be playing again tonight. Same deal as last time, I'll try to find
a place and then you can call me and see where I am am. Also we will
once again start at 8 and plan to go till 11. <br><br>Just looking at my calander This may be our third or second to last game, so be prepared to kick some ass and take some names.<br><br>Hope to see you there!<br>Tony<br><br>Syd: <br>Tone
I am not sure if I will be there tonight. I am really exhausted this
week and though we have so few games left I don't know if I'll make it.
Maybe I will but be prepared if I don't show up. I don't know how I got
so tired... Did you go to sarah's last night? I left early I have been
tired all week. Are you eating lunch in DLG at noon any time soon? I
was there on Friday expecting to see you but didn't.<br>SIGh<br>syd<br><br>Me:<br>Syd,<br><br>Ok
perhaps it is for the best. There is always a place at my table for yo
uas long as I have a table. I did not go to Sarah's last night, but
that is a long story for an email and I care not to discuss it here. <br><br>I
will be at lunch at DLG at noon every day this week with the possible
exception of friday. I was not there on last friday at noon which
brings me to an interesting point. I spyed a certain Cassius eating at
my Dining Common on friday. If good will is to remain in this world, I
trust this behavior will cease. Unspoken agreements mean nothing on
this campus as I have come to learn once again, so now I have committed
it to words.<br><br>I would like to see you, and to hang out in my
limitted time left. If, however on the off chance (though I do not
rationally believe this, yet), you are avoiding me, then please I beg
of you to tell me straight up. If you want to fully break off contact I
can accept that. No harm, no foul. I am also willing to admitt that I
am completely misreading the situation. The truth, as always, likely
lies somewhere in the middle.<br><br>Know that I always think better of you in person.<br><br>Be Well<br>Anthony<br><br>PS there is a squad of ducklings in the lagoon.  Have you seen them?<br><br>Syd:<br>dear tone<br>yes i saw the ducklings on friday aft when i skipped my section to watch them!<br>actually
i skipped my section because i was tired and lazy and wound up being so
glad that i had because i saw the first ducklings of the year.<br>he
who must not be named ate in DLG on friday? sorry, ill see about
that... funny i didn't see anybody who must not be named there. unless
you mean somebody else i dont know about, erstwhile stalkers and so
forth.<br>you know you are not the only one to be upset about the
situation between you and he who must not be named. he who must not be
named is pretty upset about it too, and about the discomfort it causes
our friends. it is all really my responsibility--it is i who should be
accused, and if there is anything i can do to resolve this between you
too i insist that you let me know.<br>it is not true that you were not
friends. your friendship simply did not look like any friendship i have
ever had--but as another distinct individual i have no right to impose
those standards on others.<br>--i just saw a japanese man frighten himself with his own umbrella...the things you see in here...--<br>i
have however kept mum about that option you hinted at to me (vis a vis
working toward resolving situation) as you also hinted that if i did
not keep mum all options would be null and void.<br>what a cryptic conversation this is.<br>hope to see you at lunch tomorrow...<br>i am not avoiding you although i have thought many times this week how it must appear such as we have not hung out lately.<br><br>Me:<br>Dear Syd,<br><br>Thanks for being frank with me.  It joys my heart that you are not avoiding me. <br><br>Also
I owe you an extreme thanks for handling the
DLG-The-One-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named-Here situation. I have been fretting
since friday trying to find a socially acceptable way to approach the
matter. I am sorry for putting you in this position and this was never
my intent. However I believe it will work better than any other. <br><br><br>"he
who must not be named is pretty upset about it too, and about the
discomfort it causes our friends. it is all really my
responsibility--it is i who should be accused, and if there is anything
i can do to resolve this between you too i insist that you let me know."<br><br>Furthermore,
You know that I do not belive the situation is your responsibility
(besides it wasn't in the stars, more tomorrow). Part of the
responsibility is mine, for I knew and accepted such terms to a
relationship with you. The other part is squarely his. If you are ever
in my situation (which I hope you won't be) you will understand more
directly. In fact the responsibility in this situation have very little
to do with you specifically and more with who you are abstractrly and
percieved violations to a possibly outdated code of honor which I
adhere to. I have spoken to you of this before and you know that I have
my reasons and compulsions for believing in (at least for myself)
things like monogomy etc. It pains me as well how this has affected us
all and our friends. Although I think I have trouble distiguishing this
hurt from the sadness of leaving.<br><br>Thank you for keeping mum about it. <br><br><br>"it is not true that you were not friends."<br>This means more to me than you know.<br><br><br>" --i just saw a japanese man frighten himself with his own umbrella...the things you see in here...--"<br>That
so reminds me of Trigun...which you would love at least the first half
of...actually you might like most of it. After the halfway point it
gets a little darker (which is cool for a kids show) but sadly less
slapstick. On the other hand, the second half contains way more of this
super bad ass priest character.<br><br>I hope to see you tomorrow.<br><br>Be Well, Kaire<br>Tony<br><br><br>If you read all that, I salute you.</td></tr>
