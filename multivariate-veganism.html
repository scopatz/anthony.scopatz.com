  <div class="entry-content"><p>Over the past month I have had <em>a lot</em> of conversations about veganism, the personal
choice to become vegan, the philosophical justifications for being vegan, and of
course delicious vegan food. There are many reasons to be vegan and it seems to be
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism#Philosophy:_ethical_and_environmental_perspectives">an idealogical past time</a>
to debate their relative&nbsp;merits.</p>
<p><strong>What I realized over the course of these discussions is that I do not seem to
care precisely why I am&nbsp;vegan.</strong></p>
<p>I agree and comply with all of the standard
justifications as well as having an individual credo which extends beyond this.
For argument&#8217;s sake, I&#8217;ll often choose a position when forced. Still I feel that
doing so is a manufactured way of having a dialog. That I am vegan is&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>In a practical sense, that one acts in a vegan manner ought to be enough for any other
other vegan.  Forsooth, often times it is not and vegans typically request that
their fellows are vegan for exactly the same reason they themselves are vegan.
Why we all cannot just get along is a question for the&nbsp;sociologists.</p>
<p>There are three, largely independent arguments that are used to justify vegan acts:
<strong>anti-suffering</strong>, <strong>environmental</strong>, and <strong>personal purity</strong>.</p>
<p>How important is a belief in each of these? Is it valuable to believe in all of
them or is a belief in one equivalent to believing in more than one? Given a
metric to jointly weigh these three arguments, how important are external&nbsp;arguments?</p>
<p>I posit that since all arguments are&nbsp;independent</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>belief in one does not preclude a belief in any&nbsp;other,</li>
<li>the arguments cannot be ranked,&nbsp;and</li>
<li>a belief in more is better than belief in fewer as it diminishes the
likelihood of accidental infractions of&nbsp;veganism.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following is a short discussion of the main arguments for veganism in light of
these&nbsp;suppositions.</p>
<div class="section" id="minimization-of-suffering">
<h2>Minimization of&nbsp;Suffering</h2>
<p>This position is often called &#8220;ethical veganism.&#8221;  I dislike this term because it
implies that other reasons for being vegan are somehow less ethical, less
justified, or less meaningful.  That said, the tenet of minimal suffering is the
correct way to phrase this&nbsp;argument.</p>
<p>Suppose we were instead to justify the hedonistic inverse - the maximization of
pleasure. Arguably, the more capacity for intelligence a being has the greater its
potential to feel pleasure. In such a system, it would be allowable to cause pain
and suffering to less intelligent creatures as long as the smarter ones experienced
a greater than commensurate pleasure. This greater pleasure is largely due to their
increased capacity to feel pleasure.  Arguably the maximization of pleasure
is the status quo and serves as the justification for existing animal abuse by
humans.  Most people tend not to think on these issues though and the true
reasons for animal abuse is probably closer to apathy, nihilism, and&nbsp;cruelty.</p>
<p>Maximizing pleasure falls further apart under scrutiny.  Is it <span class="caps">OK</span> to slap your
comatose mother?  Most people would say that it is not, even if they enjoy slapping
people. Is it wrong to hit anyone in a coma? Can the person feel the hit?  Maybe.
Maybe not.  If they do, it is in a way that is very different than how us conscious
folks experience it. What seems to be at issue is <em>consent</em>.  If abuse is not agreed
to in good faith, then it is impermissible.  This applies to the sentient and the
non-sentient who are not able to negotiate in a <em>bona fide</em> manner.
People should not abuse the weak and infirm simply because they can. Failure to
extend this to animals indicates a position of innate human superiority.  I don&#8217;t
believe in the divine right of humans as masters of the universe.
Call me&nbsp;anti-speciesist.</p>
<p>Minimization of suffering has the same problems with quantifying pleasure and pain
as a function of intellectual capacity. However, it has the advantage of erring on
the side of less suffering.  A honey bee may not feel in the same way that a
chimpanzee does but neither deserves avoidable&nbsp;suffering.</p>
<p>Still, minimization of suffering is often a &#8216;kingdomist&#8217; position.  Why stop at
animals?  How much more can a krill feel than a phytoplankton?  At what point is
Life important on its own? At what point is a living thing unimportant and merely
subservient to more complex life forms?  If our understanding and empathy of
suffering is not necessary for its minimization, then all life&#8217;s suffering ought
to be&nbsp;minimized.</p>
<p>At the point where one starts fretting about the suffering of microbes, it is
reasonable to start asking why Life is so important.  Most of the universe - to the
best of our knowledge - does not contain life.  So the question goes, &#8220;Should the
universe be free from the kinds of abuses humans perpetrate on animals?&#8221; This is
is reminiscent of the <a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GTX6YdPc954C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=rock+ethic+mars+trilogy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DFC654ITuK&amp;sig=YLu8bkPzUBD3mXqwh2iZwJE_D3o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7w-tUvr0FOiqyAHdxICgBA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA">rock ethic</a>
found in Kim Stanley Robinson&#8217;s <em>Mars Trilogy</em>.  It does not make sense to speak
about the suffering of rocks or stars.  Yet perhaps the universe should be
appreciated for what it is rather than what humans can make of it.  If you believe
this then you have walked the path from anti-suffering to environmental&nbsp;veganism.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="environmentalism">
<h2>Environmentalism</h2>
<p>The primary point in this argument is that veganism is tens to thousands of times
more efficient than alternative modalities.  Water usage is a great surrogate metric.
Vegetarian products have to go through an animal&#8217;s systems &#8212; which requires the
animal to be alive at some point.  Meat products are a one-time use of an animal
and so the water required is not able to be averaged over multiple usages.
For example, consider the same caloric value coming from eggs versus chicken breast.
The integrated water usage of chicken breast is much higher than that of the egg.
Both of these are much higher than the water usage for the equivalent caloric content
of the corn which fed the chicken throughout its&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>The ethical arguments for environmentalism are much discussed.
They can, however, tend to speciesism.
&#8220;We should try to prevent large scale climate change so that we have an
ecosystem to pass on to our children.&#8221;  In such statements ours and our own are
primary and the planet is secondary.  Veganism is thus a tool to prevent our
own suffering and incidentally minimizes that of other&nbsp;species.</p>
<p>Still, the environmentalist argument provides a needed alternative to the
anti-suffering argument.  This is because the basic metric is theoretically
measurable.  As seen above, if you don&#8217;t believe in quantifiable suffering then you
are lead to question the underlying value of life in natural systems.  If instead
you do believe that intra-life suffering is comparable then it is possible to
say that perhaps certain animal by-products are less bad because they cause less
suffering. Honey is the canonical example because bees arguably have much less
capacity for suffering than large scale&nbsp;mammals.</p>
<p>However, environmentalists veganism has no such quandaries.  Bees - whether they
can truly feel or not - is irrelevant to honey production.  Honey still requires
many times the amount of water as opposed to equivalent food stuffs (eg sugar&nbsp;cane).</p>
<p>Further environmental reasonings may be found within a sense of <em>tikkun olam</em>.
It is impossible to humans to act in an unnatural way; we are products of nature
ourselves. So while we are confined to act within the universe we ought to act
in a way that heals and creates a better universe. Veganism is one mechanism by
which we can be responsible stewards of&nbsp;existence.</p>
<p>Thus in the limit where suffering becomes small or unintelligible, environmental and
ecological arguments become more important as a justification for&nbsp;veganism.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="personal-purity">
<h2>Personal&nbsp;Purity</h2>
<p>This argument is often derided as being selfish, vain, and transitory.  Personal
purity justifications span the gamut from trying to loose weight to &#8220;my body is
a temple&#8221; to &#8220;I just feel better as a&nbsp;vegan.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, what the purity argument has that the other arguments lack is a strong
sense of personal responsibility.  Veganism is something empowered by the individual.
It is not possible for anyone to be vegan for someone else in this belief. Other
arguments focus more on systemic and external factors that could be averaged away
if there were fewer people or more other vegans. For personal purity, one must
be vegan&nbsp;oneself.</p>
<p>If someone has made the choice to be vegan or to remain vegan, this is presumably
because it brings them some measure of aesthetic or emotional satisfaction.
&#8220;I want to be beautiful.&#8221; I feel that dismissing this argument in light of veganism
is inappropriate.  People should be allowed to enjoy life in whatever
way they choose provided it does not cause implicate
them in other moral hazards. Veganism is a moral positive and does not contain
such&nbsp;hazards.</p>
<p>Veganism making you happy is equally as valid of a reason to be vegan as any&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>Though this is fundamentally an aesthetic argument, its strength is bolstered - not
diminished - by the anti-suffering and environmental arguments. If you are vegan
for environmental or anti-suffering reasons and are not happy with it, you really
should consider being happy with being&nbsp;vegan.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parting-thoughts">
<h2>Parting&nbsp;Thoughts</h2>
<p>The reasons for veganism are many and varied. Here alone we touched on three
branches of philosophy to explain&nbsp;it:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>ethics - pain is bad and the relative capacity
for suffering is&nbsp;unquantifiable,</li>
<li>metaphysics - humans have no special rights over existence,&nbsp;and</li>
<li>aesthetics - happiness is&nbsp;good.</li>
</ol>
<p>Following many of these lines of thought to their extremes often lead one of the
other branches.  This is why it bothers me when I am asked to formally pick one
reason.  Like the x, y, and z axes they are independent and inseparable.
The broad space of veganism is large enough for everyone to eat, drink, and be&nbsp;merry.</p>
