I had a fun day; I'll tell you all about it later.

Suffice it to say that I have now achieved one of my life-long goals of
staying in Howard Johnson's. This is an obscure hotel chain that is
briefly mentioned in an even more obscure Zappa song. Furthermore the
song is \*not\* on 200 Motels, which is the album where you'd figure a
chain such as this would be.
