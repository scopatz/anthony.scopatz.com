I have long been a proponent that the differences between us are
minimal. I do not intend on changing this stance, not just yet. `But
there are things that make you go "Huh?"`_

Most of my first person evidence that people communicate is the same way
is based off of me myself communicating with boys, men, and bisexual
girls and women (mother, girlfriends, lesbian friends of my mother). Now
there is a distinct difference between homosexuality and bisexuality.
However since this study is more or less preliminary we will unfairly
lump everything together.

My main point is that my perception that everyone is the same or similar
\*could\* be just a product of selective experiences. I \*may\* have
even been raised to be predisposed to these selective experiences. Have
I then in some way been disadvantaged? Are my expectations of how women
should communicate skewed? Is my dogmatic belief that people are more
alike than different have no bearing on reality?

I am open to further inquiry, since abandoning the pursuit of equality
should not be done lightly. Interestingly enough, the researchers
themselves take their results to mean that homosexuality is in fact
nature and not nurture. I am not sure that this really holds since they
are not (from what it seems) testing over a large range of ages and
developments. Still, the work does lead to a host of other questions.
