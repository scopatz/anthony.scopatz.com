Transport Those Neutrons!

Today is quite strange. It is almost as if it was a full day of out body
experiences. Not that I am claiming that I have ever had an out of body
experience. Rather, I was more or less just observing myself.
Furthermore, being an ENTJ, I am very critical.

I couldn't even do such things like go to the coffee shop or Japanese or
play War 3 in peace.

I think I am freaking out over nothings. I am over-analyzing situations,
The situation. I want someone to make a state of Anthony's life speech
for me so I can criticize.

I think Devo put it best with:

| Freedom of choice
|  Is what you got
|  Freedom of choice!
|  Then if you got it you don't want it
|  Seems to be the rule of thumb.

I may just be having an episode where I have a lot of choices. Because
of this, I feel I am not always making or have made the best choices. Or
Worse yet, had an oppurtunity to make a better choice but didn't think
of it at the time.

I should stop listening to Devo
