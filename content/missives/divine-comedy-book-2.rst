Enigma girls are still tricky, but not wholly in the way I thought. I
guess I didn't realize true emotional/mental/spiritual effort that goes
into them.

I had approached them originally like a coin. You don't *a priori* know
how they are going to respond, so you may a well flip and be done with
it.

However, this only really representative of the situation on the ground
before the toss. It turns out Enigma girls are more like
event/probability trees, like a sport's division playoff roster. There
are a bunch of options, contingencies and paths.

Furthermore, there are a million pathways to "No". A relatively few
number that are successful. And still a small number that manage to
maintain (more or less) the status quo.

Even playing a perfect game does not guarantee a "Yes". Other players
could have closed these paths down long ago.

So what then are these Enigma girls? They are coins whose one face is a
flat negative and whose positive side is a tree. But the forest is dark
and finding the right set of branches could leave you hanging for a
couple of years, waiting for new growth.

Am I content to hang? Yes, though I might braciate elsewhere. Like to Texas.
Am I sad? No, even though the it was understood that this contingency
was the most likely, it is still disappointing hear it. However, I am a
bit proud that I made it this far. Lesser men and women have fallen
^\_^.

You enigma girls are truly my betters. Friends until the end.
