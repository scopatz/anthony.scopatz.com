So yesterdayevening I dragged myself to this movie called "The Visitors"
being shown by the French Alliance. The movie was really funny. It is
about an 11th (although the costumes were more 14th) century Knight and
his squire who want to go back in time to correct a wrong the night did
by shooting this barron in the head with a crossbow (he was drugged by a
witch). Instead, of course, they end up in the 20th century. Very Star
Trek.

However, due to some malfunction they couldn't get the subtitles to
work. But I stayed anyways and watched the whole film. It is amazing how
much information you can still get out of a film even though you can
only catch one out of every 20 words and that is "Mossiuer".

In any event, you should try it sometime...or see that movie. Either
works
