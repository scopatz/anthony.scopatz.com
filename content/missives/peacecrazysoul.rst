Last Saturday, I was one of the ones privileged enough to be present at
the 'Rally to Restore Fear and/or Sanity' in Washington DC.  It was more
by providence that I went than specifically desiring to participating in
a faux political event hosted by a cable television channel.

I was in the District, where people still don't have the right to vote,
for of all things a Department of Energy meeting.  Is the irony leaking
through this series of tubes yet?

Still, the rally was fun.  The show was entertaining enough; you can
watch that online.  But from the steps of the National Gallery, the
gathering was more about entertaining signage.

The event started out well with a poster stating:

    Repeal `Godwin's Law`_

And of course there was no shortage of the hard-to-disagree-with:

    Only Hitler was Hitler

in apparent  reference to Glen Beck's penchant for declaring everyone he
disagrees with a Nazi.  (So pervasive is his obsession that even `the
Economist`_ takes heed.)

A similar truism was a giant piece of cardboard that must have been 5 x
7 feet, supported by PVC pipe, blocked everyone's view, and read:

    | \ **Front:**\  This Sign is Too Damn Big
    |  \ **Back:**\  BIG SIGN

There were more explicitly political ones in the mix as well.  Melding
both poignancy and wit was a young woman who proudly exclaimed:

    I Masturbate to Christine O'Donnell

Whatever floats your witch, lady...  (All the good ones seem to sink.  I
feel cheated.)

However, the most righteous one was held by a (presumably) Saudi woman
who was wearing a chromatic flower lei.  The sign itself had a quarter
rainbow, starting and ending in clouds,  and stated:

    God Loves Fags

I watched her take a picture flanked by two men who each had posters
declaring

    Don't Deport My Husband!

I wouldn't even think of it...  And lest you think that the rally itself
was devoid of nerds, I found this gem in the trash outside of the
Canadian embassy:

    Americans for Gaussian Distributions

Now *that* is a platform I can get behind!
