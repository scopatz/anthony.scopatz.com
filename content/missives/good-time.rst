So here I am sitting, In my closet, typing away at the laptop which is
perched on top of my server.

Why am I in my closet one may ask?

Well the simple answer is that I am sleeping in my closet on my fold out
bed so as to give Tara her spae on my bed.

Tara made it here for a visit. We are having a fun chill time here. She
has met mst of my friends so far and likes the ones that I like. I do
believe there is a good group of people here. Even though I have a ton
of work to do , I think I can manage.

Good Times. Her visit gies me a much needed reprieve before I diove into
the end of the semester. I'll write more later. Sleep Well Diary!
