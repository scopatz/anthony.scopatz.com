Burlesque Show!

Last night was way too much fun for its own good. In addition to the
normal burlesque show (which had a fair share of tittilation) they also
had a bondage act, a fire act and a suspension act.

Oh, My, God, The suspension act was the most glorious and erotic thing I
have ever seen in person. If I could see that every night...

If I could be a quarter of how satisfied I was last night in my normal
sexual experiances, I would walk around with a permenant smile. And that
was just watching!! I go dreamy just thinking about it.

And hear is the real pop-your-topper. This was a benifit show that goes
towards AIDS research and support in Austin. So it was Hedonism for a
good cause.

Have I ever told you that I love Austin?
