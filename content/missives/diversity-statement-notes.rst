*Last week, Matthew Turk asked me to give a brief, 10 minute talk to weekly
the Astronomy department lunch at Columbia University.  He specifically requested 
that I talk about diversity in technical fields and SciPy 2013.  This was my first 
time speaking on this topic.  I was nervous.  What follows are my mostly undoctored 
notes.*

Matt asked me to talk today about diversity in the worlds of science, scientific 
computing, and software development.   I am guessing this comes out of our 
organization of the SciPy 2013 conference, where I was the communications chair.  
I was changed with increasing attendance from 200 people in 2012 to a hopeful 
350 people.  We sold out weeks in advance.

Diversity is a topic near and dear to my heart, so I’d like to start off on a 
personal note.  

Most of the time, the vast, overwhelming, majority of the time, I think of myself 
as a Python virtual machine.  Occasionally, for survival purposes only, I am also 
a C++ compiler.  Largely I run physics simulations inspired by reality.  
Since computers can do these things way better than I can, I am fairly useless.

But this is not how most other humans perceive me.  Most people see me a male, a man.  
I didn’t ask for that.  I am also Jewish - currently a privileged class, 
though not so historically.  I am straight as a broken arrow, have just celebrated 
my first 29th birthday, and earn well above the $40k annual family of 4 median 
poverty line in this country.

I could change any of these aspects of myself, but the activation energy to do 
so is high, and most of the time I am going to hum along as a Python interpreter 
anyway.

The current state of diversity is shameful.  Looking only at gender, in software 
development 11% women is considered normal.  PyCon, which had 20% women attendees 
in 2013 is lauded for its extraordinary efforts towards inclusion.  In the physical 
sciences, percentages are not much better, being between 25 - 50% most places.  
Need I remind you that biologically males are the minority!  

Issues of race, orientation, national origin, *etc.* are often times even worse off 
than the gender axis.  These are technical fields.  We should be agnostic to 
these issues and the percentages should roughly match those of the great 
society we live within.  For technical integrity, we should relate to each other 
as Python interpreters and Physics engines, and then as friends.  
We should never interface with each other as classifications.  Types belong in 
programming, not the programmer.

Say what you will about LBJs foreign & domestic policy, but in justifying 
affirmative action for African Americans he said the following which I believe 
is pertinent to us:

.. pull-quote::

    Nothing is more freighted with meaning for our own destiny than the 
    revolution of the Negro American...In far too many ways American Negroes 
    have been another nation: deprived of freedom, crippled by hatred, the doors 
    of opportunity closed to hope...But freedom is not enough. You do not wipe 
    away the scars of centuries by saying: Now you are free to go where you want, 
    and do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a 
    person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him 
    up to the starting line of a race and then say, 'you are free to compete with 
    all the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely 
    fair...This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil 
    rights. We seek not just freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity 
    but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a 
    fact and equality as a result...To this end equal opportunity is essential, 
    but not enough, not enough.

If the goal is to get to a steady state of equality, then our
actions require more than not being racist and sexist now.  

**So what to do?**  We still need to uphold the meritocratic aspects of our 
fields -- no one gets a free pass.  But there are ways to do this that are more 
inclusive than others.  They all involve being more welcoming.  That is it.  
Just let people know that you provide a safe space, you’ll treat them and their 
ideas equally (either equally well or harshly), and that you encourage them but 
will not drag them to participate.

Often times, it is the little, overlookable gestures that make a world of 
difference.  Have a diversity statement, have a code of conduct statement, 
provide ladies T-shirts, have a diversity mailing list if requested.

The Python Software Foundation has been a true source of leadership in this area:

.. pull-quote::

    The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and 
    encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, 
    tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to 
    these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, 
    and whatever your background, we welcome you.

If you want to go above and beyond this, engage with professional societies that 
cater to diversity.  PyLadies, Women in Science and Engineering, Nuke Pride, and
so on.

If you *really* want to jump over the moon, start a non-profit.  
Advocate for inclusion.  Advocate for change. In the face of adversity, stand firm.

Don't hate.
