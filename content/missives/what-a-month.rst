So I haven't updated in a WHOLE month. Even my "minimum once-a-week"
rule has been shamelessly broken. My Google Reader is in a complete
disarray. I have been busy.

Right now is the first night of a 10 day stint in Madison. It has
involved, keys, bike rides, meeting people, citywide WiFi, bourbon on
the rocks, and beer. Have I mentioned that I love this place yet? Fear
not AustiKnights, you are still bigger and have better weather. I was
really concerned that I would be completely burnt out by the time I got
up here and come to resent this trip, but so far I love it.

Of course loving Madison requires `leaving the Pumpkin Patch behind`_...

...though supposedly drunken corn mazes are all the rage up here. (1
liter of Cranberry Juice and 1 liter of Vodka in a Camelbak, seriously?!
That is fantastic.)

But that has all been in the last 2 and a half days. Before that I was
in the Bay Area. Someday I will live in my house. Can I hear it for
November?

If there is one thing I have learned, there are a lot of fucking cool
people in America. All distilled separately, it proves hard to mix them.
Seems I'll just have to keep travelling and sampling.
