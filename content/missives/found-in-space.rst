Whew! Made it back to Austin...Finally! The last leg of this trip was
really rough.

If going back to California is like putting on an old shoe, than coming
back to Texas is like putting on an old boot. Considerably more
difficult but nostalgic and worth it all the same. Time to start my own
life again, right? Like totally, Y'all!

So onto my own life....

I have my qualifying exams on Monday. Oops! Combo break that with all of
the unpacking and re-'rangin' I have to do around the house and I more
or less will be ignoring everyone until after I take them. Wish me luck!

It is probably bad that my only compulsions right now are to unpack,
ogle my prints of Colleen Moore, and interface with things of Gundam
nature, huh?
