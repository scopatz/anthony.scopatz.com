I am now really in Chicago and dear me.  If I were to live my life by
one saying it is, "Easily distracted by awesomeness."

AWESOME?!"]\ |Sequoia, Sean, Julian, Jenny|\ [/caption]

The problem is that there is so much awesomeness going on right now that
I can't keep up.

#. I finally moved into the co-op.  My mind seems to explode with every
   conversation.  It is exhausting.
#. I get to meet all sorts of cool people at work in the High Energy
   Density Physics community.  I am not sure I can keep up.
#. I get to talk about scientific computing to everyone I meet.
    Bootcamps here I come.  Dammit, more work.
#. I am writing my first grant proposal to DOE.  My brain has fractured.
#. Something secret I can't talk about that will take a lot of focus.
#. I am reading "The Nibelungenlied."  As a connoisseur of epic poetry,
   I am thoroughly impressed by this translation.  I have been writing
   couplets because of it.

Not to say that everything in life is going perfectly, but all of this
has left me in a catatonic state of saturation.
