I read this quote recently, or some quote like it:

    There can be no progress, no real change, until the world stops
    eating meat.

I would love to find out who said it in the first place.  Walking down
the street today, I saw a man texting in a white, sporty Honda Accord.  
Later on, there was a man sitting at the stop light, with the windows
rolled down, cranking *"Man Who Sold The World."* I sung along.  I was
not embarrassed.

I own a car.  I pay for it.  I hardly ever use it.  I have friends who
have given up their cars.  Sometimes, they ride the bus.  I am too much
of a wimp.  Can there ever be any real change?  What is fake change?

I don't deserve avocados year round.
