Two things. I haven't been getting enough work done recently. Today for
instance. I was going to spend the night programming after my
departmental function. But no. During the after-party at Crown & Anchor,
I got shamefully drunk on a pint and a half of beer. This seems to be
happening a lot lately. If I eat what I normally eat (salad+) then I
can't drink how I used to drink. So I spent the rest of the night eating
and sleeping off a hangover. LAME. I am LAME.

Secondly, this weekend was my first time fully cross dressing in public.
We went dancing on the pedestrian bridge over the river. Every article
down to my shoes (W40) was intended for women or not meant as clothing
(chain link belt). Sure, the shirt was given to me by a girl in North
Carolina, but it is a women's cut so it counts. For those of you not
here to enjoy it:

Also, secret bonus third line item: Beanie for my birthday gave me two
pounds of coffee beans (yeah!). Which is frankly too much for me to
drink in any reasonable time frame. So I am thinking Chocolate Coffee
Cookies, anyone in? Just want to help me eat them? That is fine too.
