This is so insane I have to tell you \ ***all***\  about it.

Anthony and Trevor and I all went out to Rudy's, which is a local
Tex-Mex bar-ish hang-out kind-of place.

We were walking around while we waited for a table. We passed this
couple a couple of times.

The second time we passed them the young, lithe lady had the chutzpa to
ask this question:

"Are you guys Computer Programmers?"

After a "who-wants-to-know" session, it came out that I in fact am,
though Anthony and Trevs are not.  But I could not let this aggression
stand, Man.  So I asked them "How did you guess?"

Their definitive response was "The Uterus T-Shirt". 
WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF?

Moral: If you go into programming, you may not get any pussy, but you
will get a lot of Uteri.
