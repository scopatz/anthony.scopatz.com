Today is so nuts!

In addition to being everywhere always; I also had to do a fair amount
of real work with the one of the slowest internet connections I have
ever had. It was lame. And then there are the logistics of how I am
going to get the car back to my folks. It is just nuts.

Anyways I am off to see Shane perform for the first time since he
entered college. Should be good. I am excited.

Ownward, to the dance!
