OK. I am still generally avoiding people and all that entails. However,
if one or two peeps want to go and spend an hour or two and get some
food at some point, I may now be up for this.

But shoot me an email or txt or something. Don't call or just show up or
anything. I am still going to be ignore Micheal's guests should you ever
fall into this category.

If you don't take me up on this offer that is fine too. I am still not
in a space where I feel comfortable hanging out. And like always, I am
going to pull a Scopatz on any questions you ask, so please make it
easier on both of us.
