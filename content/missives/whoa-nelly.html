So I went out hitting the bars & clubs in Santa Barbara last night with Shawn.<br><br>Man
was that fun. It turns out I really like the two drinks I ordered: A
White Russian and a shot of Don Julio tequilla with salt and a lime. <br><br>By far the best music I heard was when I put a buck into the Juke Box.  My Playlist?<br><br>ZZ Top - Cheap Sunglasses<br>James Brown - Papa's got a Brand New Bag<br>Frank Sinatra - Forget Domanni (sp?)<br><br>By
Far the Sinatra was the most danceable music I heard for the entire
night. This makes me really look forward to spending Christmas in Las
Vegas. My family and the Rowes are planning on meeting up there. I
wanna go get drunk in a lounge casino bar with my cousins and listen to
Jazz malet ensemble or Sinatra Cover band. That would be bliss.<br><br>In
other news, last night I ran into my friends Tanya and Irene. That
first time was fine. The second time reminded me of Neil Young's "The
Needle and The Damage Done." Here he says that "Every Junkie is like a
Setting Sun." Tanya was about as wasted as I have ever seen a friend
and Irene was more on top of things but that was because she had just
thrown up every drink she had that night. So one was super drunk and
one was just sad. I could type the whole saga, but really, why bother?<br><br>Cheers!
