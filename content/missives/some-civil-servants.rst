I have Friends!

Thanks to all of you who have called or written lately. I have been
negligent. Do believe that I miss you sorely. While I am not ready to
pull up the stakes and move back to Santa Barbara, however Los Angeles,
Santa Cruz, San Fransisco and Irvine, and Three Rivers are all morsels
on my tongue, salivating like some pet of Pavlov's.

Of Course this is all very Catch-22'd since I would then be leaving
Austin and the people here I would miss very much too. Everyone gets
their time, Or I get theirs. You all understand, right....

Loved Ones, Loved Ones. Take the Highway; Park; Come up and See Me. I'll
be Working, Working. But if you come visit, I'll put down what I am
doing; My Friends are Important.
