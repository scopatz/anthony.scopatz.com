Oh Good God Damn!

The Protomen are \*finally\* doing a tour that is West of the Goddamn
Mississippi, and of course they are going to be in fucking Austin on
August 2nd or 3rd. And of course, because of fucking Idaho I am not.

Looks like I have to catch them this weekend in San Diego or
Hollywood...

But whosoever shall go with me?!
