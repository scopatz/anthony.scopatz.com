<p>
On episode 9, we discus the very new Open Source Hardware Defintion 1.0, the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) movement,
and how a definition is different than a license. As you'll soon learn, the hardware world sufficently
different from software such that it requires a distinct stragery. Still, the success and failures of open
source software have been taken a lessons learned as hackers and companies around the world pool together
in this experiment in freedom.

Today's hosts include:
<ul>
  <li>Ayah Bdeir (special guest)</li>
  <li>Alica Gibb (special guest)</li>
  <li>Anthony Scopatz (moderator)</li>

<strong>Ayah Bdeir</strong> is an engineer and interactive artist that graduated from the MIT Media Lab and before receiving a
fellowship at Eyebeam Art + Technology Center in New York. She taught graduate classes at NYU and Parsons,
and was a mentor in the regional reality tv-show Stars of Science promoting science and technology innovation
in the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
In 2010, Ayah was granted a fellowship with Creative Commons in recognition of her work, including
spearheading the first Open Hardware definition and co-chairing the Open Hardware Summit at the New
York Hall of Science in September of 2010.
</p>

<p>
Ayah is the creator of littleBits, an award winning kit of pre-assembled circuits made easy by tiny magnets,
now in production. She is also the founder of Karaj, Beirut's lab for experimental art, architecture and
technology. Ayah lives and works between Beirut and New York.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Alicia Gibb</strong> is a researcher and rapid prototyper at Bug Labs (http://www.buglabs.net). When she's not
doing research on the crossroads of open technology and innovation, she's prototyping artwork that blinks,
twitches, and might even be tasty to eat. She is a catalyst in the open hardware movement, and co-chaired
the first Open Hardware Summit in the fall of 2010. At Bug Labs she runs the academic research program
and the Test Kitchen, an open R&amp;D Lab, her current project is an NSF funded project to make a device for
measuring physics classroom experiments. She has a master's degree in information science and in art history.
