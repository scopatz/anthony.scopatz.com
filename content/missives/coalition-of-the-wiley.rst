I \*hate\* Idaho. I \*hate\* Duncans.

WHY do I \*Love\* Duncan Idaho?

It might be transparent but I have also joined the Dune bandwagon. My
stop is coming up soon though. I am rereading the fifth book. The more I
think about it they, just get better as the series goes on. Miles Teg is
a complete bad-ass.

And speaking of bad-asses, I saw my first Lupin III. Specifically, The
Castle of Cagliostro. It was beautiful the older Animation way that I
love so much. But, back to the point, no character n that whole movie
was not incredibly cool.

This, naturally, brings me to my point. People are drawn to
representations of humans who that they can't relate to. The familiar
argument that humanity connects with its art through personal
substitution just does not always hold.

Now ok, that may be obvious that it isn't strictly true because very
little is strictly true.

The point is that there is so little that unites me to most of these
characters, likable or not from the, it is strange that I am drawn to
them.

There may be some fundamental human truth this figures typically face
great adversity and hold up with astonishing resolve and wit. Now, all
must face adversity and fear and danger. The characters' cleverness is
certainly admirable.

Now, from a moral perspective, almost none of these characters win
because they are on the side of Righteousnesses.

Ok so now we can say that someone is bad-ass and deserving of praise if
they are good under pressure if not good people.

This does not eclipse non-bad-asses from being compelling.

So in answer to the original question I think that Lupin would be able
to beat Duncan Idaho in hand to hand combat BUT only if Duncan Idaho did
\*not\* have his mentat abilities and was not in a Tleilaxu enhanced
ghola.
