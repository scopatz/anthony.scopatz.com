I have this problem where if I can tolerate an anime enough to sit all
the way through it, it becomes the best thing in the world for 3 days or
so.

Although, it should be noted that I do have a soft spot in my heart for
characters with obsessive compulsive disorder, and this series has at
least 6 of them. Rarely are all of them off screen.
