I just don't know what to do with myself

I think my body is depressed, if not my mind.

My only evidence to this end is that my body doesn't want to wake up
(which only happens when I am sad) and I am playing video games again
(which I use as escapism). And that there is nothing that I have control
over that I have any damn right to be sad over.

For example, after I failed my quals the first time out I spent way too
much time on Disgaea, and then a shamefully long amount of time of Elder
Scrolls IV: Oblivion after that. Not that I am anywhere near that
commitment on Civilization Revolutions yet, but stirll.

I don't want to work; I basically wanna get on a plane and fly away. And
sleep. Man I need to kick this. I have a ton of stuff to do. Luckily my
debugging went well today because 5 months ago I had the good sense to
write readable code. Unlike 9 months ago.

But that is that. Probably part of it is this conversation Shawn and I
had about girls last night. He has a more scattershotgun approach than I
do. Thus his advice sort of runs counter to the conventional wisdom that
Kerry Prime gives me (and others). In fact their seem to be two camps:

-  The peeps who have known me since high school (with whom I tend to
   agree)
-  And the folks who I have met afterwards, who generally encourage a
   broader choice range

I don't know. I am sick of thinking about this. And I am tired. And all
I wanna do is play Civ and sleep and get my PhD. And GO ON VACATION.
