So Tomorrow I give my presentation. I may have finally earned a respite
at least for a short while. I need a break as this work has taxed my
corpus and psyche so thoroughly that I am having trouble functions
normally now.

My brief break this weekend consisted of reading parts of Muir's
writings on his youth in the bathroom and a LAN party at my house which
I gloriously did not have to organize (all props to Patrick here). Below
is hopefully a picture of it.

More peeps were here. Who you can see, however, is Sierra on the Left,
Anthony's back, Robin on the couch, and then Patrick behind her.

It was pretty fun but I had to work all the next day.
