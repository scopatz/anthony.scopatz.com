Kerry! I wanna talk to you! (But we already had this discussion. However
in the unlikely event you ever recive a strange note from a German or
Attic person, I owe you one.)

Kerry! Write me back so I can write you back. Have I got a story for
you! (Sorry if the last letter was a little underdeveloped. I
\*promise\* the next one will be better.)

Everyone else, change your name to Kerry and I'll come back and edit
this post to refer to you as well. Scouts Honor.
