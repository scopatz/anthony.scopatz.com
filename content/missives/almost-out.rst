Sorry to disappoint, but this is not an "Almost Out" of that most famous
closet that everyone seems to be in.

Rather this is an "Almost Out" of Idaho commentary.

Now before I go, I will take pictures of that stupid statue of the Ten
Commandments that is steaming pile of sacrilege. Unfortunately I do not
have the cable for the digital camera here so it must wait until I get
back to California.

My itinerary is roughly that I will be going to SLC by tomorrow night.
On Saturday I will meet up with my mother in Reno for lunch. Saturday
night I am gonna go into he city to go to a show with Tommy and then
crash at his place. Sunday night I will be seeing one of the silent film
festival shows, and then need to find a place to stay. Also someone
please go to the movie with me!

So in summary, I hate this place and I am leaving.

Also this marks my last day at this nice coffee house. Makes me kinda
sad in some sense. With any luck I won't ever be back though. Some of
the only reasonable people I have met in this state frequent or work
here.
