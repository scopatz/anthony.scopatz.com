Just disabled or deleted all online dating profiles.

The OkC one I am leaving up for the sole purpose of the Walker
experiment. Shame to get rid of all of that hard work. Not to mention I
want to keep the 'avilin' username. I made that mistake with Yahoo!

Adios, people on the internet in Austin, Texas who want nothing to do
with me!
