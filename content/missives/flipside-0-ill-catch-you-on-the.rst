Hello World!

Just got back from my very first `Burning Flipside`_. Good golly, Ms
Molly! There was so much pretty, shiny, awesome, tasty, lovely, that
once again I can't cover it all in a single post. Or even in a couple of
posts. Or even bother to write them all in a single day. Some of this
stuff needs to sit and gel for a couple of days.

So I am going to do what I did for Pallas. There will be a series of
forthcoming Flipside posts each based around a central theme. I will
definitely start with a 'summary of events' post, to set the stage.
Certain posts may be locked based on the sensitivity of the material, so
no worries. I shall give myself until Thursday to pop all of these out.
After that, travel happens and I will be distracted.

Re-culturing myself to Civilization is significantly more difficult than
the other way around. WHY ISN'T EVERYONE NAKED?
