Since I have been studying a lot recently, I have been listening to a
lot of music. So much so that I got bored with my own ample collection.

Though I have known about `Pandora`_ for a while now, only in the past
week have I started listening to it with any frequency. It is really
great for those genres where there are a lot of artists who do a couple
of songs each that are really good.

Thus the Doo-Wop 'station' is wonderful. As is the `E-Rotic`_ one I
made, which more or less plays a lot of `EDM`_. However, through Pandora
and some side research, I have made two awesome discoveries:

-  **`Dr. Octagonecologyst`_:** This AWESOME pun is an album and stage
   name of Kool Keith. It apparently helped define Trip Hop. I am very
   tempted to buy this one. I think he is coming to Austin in a few
   months too.
-  **`Elis Regina`_:** Just when I was about to take it down, it looks
   like I have another name to add to the **`"Dead Women I'd Bang"`_**
   list! This talented and gorgeous Brazilian singer from the '60s -
   '80s recorded a version of *`"Aguas de Marco"`_* that is still hailed
   as the best selling Brazilian track of all time.

   It is so popular, in fact, that `someone`_ should do a `Coverville`_
   of it. I have actually been a fan of "Aguas de Marco" for a while now
   without knowing it. I first heard it through the percussion group
   `Uakti`_. "Aguas de Marco" is the first song of theirs on `this
   sample stream`_. The acclaimed Elis Regina version is found below. It
   is hard to say which version I like more.

I still haven't found a singer in Occitan to steal my heart.
