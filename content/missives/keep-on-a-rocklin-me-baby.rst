So I have spent the past couple of days in sunny Rocklin, CA, which is a
suburb of Sacramento. Other than Sean, who I am visiting, this place is
the Anti-Austin. Basically this town looks like the perverse combination
of rampant commercialism/capitalism crossed with a town that was built
yesterday. Every store chain you could possibly think of is within a 5
mile radius. I could never live here. On the other hand, Sean is here
and that is awesome. Also the Fry's Electronics is train themed and
really well decorated.

In other news, I survived the holiday season (does that mean we can
shoot them?). I am still no closer to deciding what I ultimately want to
do with my life. However I talked things through with Sean today (about
our respective goals) and I think I am going to try to really do
something big. The option is there for me (I think/hope) such that if I
worked hard and wanted to I could settle into a comfortable middle class
lifestyle. However, I think I can do better. Somehow, someway I could
make an impact on the US/world.

I have a couple ideas on this front which I have expressed to Sean and
mentioned to Seekatz, but enacting them will take a lot of work and be
tricky. Furthermore, in the mean time something significant but more
reasonable may come along. I am hesitant to express it yet...

Sean helped though I have resolved not to just easily slip into the
academic world just yet. To really distinguish myself I have to do
something else. For my cousin Aaron that is writing for Wired. I am less
journalistically interested. I think journalism is a tool and I may be
able to turn that to my advantage but not a means in and of itself. I am
still rolling ideas around in my head hoping to form a general plan
where various stages build off of one another.

What is really important about this though I think is that it means I
will put off the direct search for Companionship+ indefinitely. If all
goes well, life will just happen to me. Time to put the pieces together.
I give myself 5 years.
