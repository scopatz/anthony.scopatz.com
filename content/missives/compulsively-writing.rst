So I think I am going to grow my beard again. I don't know. Maybe I am
unsettled with my visage in general and the beard is an easy point of
contention. Maybe I will become a three pronged rock-lobster. ANYTHING
IS POSSIBLE. FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS!

Outside of the latest rash of sexless work, I have been Gundam focused
recently. If this starts to turn you off, don't stop reading, I swear
this relates back to the real world and gets interesting.

Ok so the first series I finished within the past month was "`G
Gundam`_\ ". It. was. `awful`_. Now that we have an understanding, there
were exactly two points of significant interest.

**1)** The main plot revolved around an evil machine (lit. called Devil
Gundam) and its supporters that was out to destroy humanity in order to
give the Earth time to heal. Sort of a post-apocalyptic eco-terrorist
Dragon Ball Z. Almost but not quite worth it. However, at the end, one
of the main bad guys eventually comes around and understands that humans
are also a product of nature, and trying to destroy them as an unnatural
blight is oxymoronic.

In light of Earth Day, this is particularly interesting. For a while I
have been struggling with the fact that some of the assumptions that the
Green movement makes seem to be founded in this "People are Wrong"
attitude. The whole idea behind Zero Population Growth is founded in
this. Now what they really mean is that poorer people, people with
different political ideologies, and people who tend to have darker skin
should stop breeding. But Sweet Char Aznable, if Master Asia in some
Japanese kids show can understand that humanity is a natural phenomena
than they should be able to as well!

If someone wants to make a point about not impacting their environment,
then they should become a vegetarian, or stop driving or flying, or just
let themselves die if they feel that strongly about it. /sigh

**2)** The other point where G Gundam gets props is that one of the
supporting men isn't. They do a very
good job of covering up the fact that George de Sand (of Neo France)
is probably a woman. They did name the character after `George Sand`_,
the male pen name of a famous French woman author. The real person took
the name to get published; the cartoon character probably took the name
to participate in the inane Gundam fight.

Other evidence includes the fact the George de Sand uses a special
attack called "Rose Bits" which is very very similar to the funnel
attacks used in previous series by exclusively female characters.
Moreover, even though the French princess in completely enamoured with
George, s/he seems not to care. George expresses multiple times that he
is only fighting on her behalf because it is what is expected as the
representative knight of his country.

I applaud such gender subversion aimed at 10 year old boys.

The next series I watched was `Gundam Wing`_. If you follow my twitter,
you have seen a lot of hilarious stuff on this. However, the theme of
this more serious series was whether the use of robots in war was
permissible.

We seem to be headed down this road (unmanned drones, etc) so it will
likely come up. Naturally, the argument for is that robots will make
your war clean and efficient (as long as you trust who is running them).
The argument against is that it takes the humanity out of war. More than
just the nothing wagered, nothing lost, the characters in the series
seemed obsessed with human suffering. Mechatronics cheapening all
prospects of real pain.

Either way, the US is arming little robots as we speak. There hasn't
really been a debate about the ethics of this. Much like the name of the
game is ICBMs these days, I doubt there will be. But maybe there should
be. I think I would rather be shot down by a soldier than an overgrown
roomba.
