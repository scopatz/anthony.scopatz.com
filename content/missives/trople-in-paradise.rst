Ok, everybody remembers when Wikipedia was shiny and new right? You
would spend hours getting lost in the flow of the links. Luckily Michael
introduced me to this amazing website: `TV Tropes`_. Sadly, it is just
as addicting.

More or less it goes through about every form of media (including REAL
LIFE) and links it to the tropes, cliches, plot devices that the piece
at hand utilizes. So it is more or less amazing.

Be forewarned that is completely written by nerds of the "New Media
Studies" variety. So if you don't get the humor I apologize. This also
means that while they may have listed every anime known to man, they
have probably left out your favorite silent film. In any event, it is
hilarious!

But with such a proliferation of tropes, `including ones that are older
than dirt`_, one has to wonder if it is even possible to come up with
something new and original. Everything you touch will be cataloged and
made fun of on this website.

| That being said, here are a few of my favorite pages:
|  `Get A Hold of Yourself Man (Brightslap!)`_
|  `Death By Pragmatism`_
|  `Minovsky Particle`_
|  `Always Chaotic Evil`_
|  `Kill Em All`_
|  `Grows the Beard`_
|  ...and of course, `Space Jews`_
