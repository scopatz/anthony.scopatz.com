I went down town again last night with Shawn. At about 11.00 things
became rather decadent for me and I wanted to leave but for Shawn's
sake we stayed longer. I was the designated driver. Things just aren't
the same if you are not drinking and you only have the one friend who
is running off with others all the time. I didn't really mind though. I
wanted to meet Shawn's friend Ed, who turns out to be quite the
character. I appreciated him. I just wasn't in the mood.
