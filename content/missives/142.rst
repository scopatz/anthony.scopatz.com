Well my web server went down last night. So anyone who tried to check my
website while I was asleep then it would have totally failed.

I haven't left my place much recently so I went down to the gym today
and had a really good workout. I now weigh about 9-10 lbs more than I'd
like. But this is good. This means that in a couple more months I should
hit my target weight. Idaho set me back quite a bit, but I think I have
half-way recovered.
