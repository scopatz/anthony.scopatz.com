Ok so I disappered for a few days and I realized that my previous post indicated none of where or why I went.<br><br><br>Ok
so I was really flustered and after the bullshit of last week so I went
to visit my cousin Andrew and the whole (or what is left) crowd from
the Valley. Here was the beautiful thing about this weekend I only made
two decitions the whole time, when I was to arrive and when I was to
leave. On this trip I really only didn't see Racheal (and Other Andrew
of course). I didn't see Kai for as long as I'd like since he was
working. I did get to where this bitchin' Cowboy hat of Mowi's though.
Mowi and Kai now have these three adorable kittens. I love these
people. They are really my friends. I know that they have polotiks
within themselves and I am thankfully not a part of that. However I
feel that even if I was a less transitory member of their friend group
I would still manage to stay mostly out of it. The clear comparriosn I
am making here is Morgan Hill. While I may date someone, I will be the
first and then not terribly embroiled after all is said and done. I
still manage to be a part of them though. I feel I am a trusted friend
of all of them. Andrew and I tend to satisfy the same social niche even
though we have very different life styles. The proximity of our
birthdays (no accident by the way) only enhances the mood that I am
some sort of twin who was seperated. I got to see Josh for a good bit
which is good. He made the hard choice of taking off school to help his
family while his mom recovers from cancer. I am so proud/envious. I
wish I could have made a similar choice. Of coruse, my families
problems were a bit more insidous in terms of timelines of information.
I also saw Eric. He is a great person too. So at one point it was Eric,
Andrew, Josh and I hanging out and I realized that, on some level, we
were all Jewish. Thus the kabalists. <br><br>I met Andrew 3 or Other
Other Andrew. Seems like an ok guy. He is going to Cal Poly in Physics.
That kinda took me by suprise. Up to then he seemed like the
sterotypical Valley nerd-dork (whole different breed than NorCal trust
me guys...I've lived both lives). Andrew was noticibly bitter...as well
he should be, but then why invite them to the movie if it would just
upset you. Once again, I feel trapped into having to let my less
experianced friends make their own dumb relationship mistakes.<br><br>Meanwhile,
I realized that, escpecially if I move to TexAss, no one else I ever
meet will meet as my childhood friends. 
<!--
Syd was around long enough to
meet them all basiclly. I had some shitty flashbacks to going down to
the valley with her and Dan. I tried to escape, but escaping into my
past present and future didn't work. Those two are fucking persistent.
Just like family.

<br><br>And Next weekend I do it all again!  Isn't life quaint.
