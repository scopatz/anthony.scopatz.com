Happy B-Day Daler Mehndi! (And me too ^\_^)

I wish I had permenant Internet at my place rather than sitting in the
get this...Texas Frech Bread Co.

IN any event my place for the day are to go to a thrift shop and buy
myself a tie and maybe a hat and maybe a vest and definitely a pocket
watch if I can find one. Then I might go to the Sexuality seminar if I
can find and do some food shopping and definetly go see a late showing
of Snakes on a Plane. My God I can't escape internet culture even when I
don't have internet for a week and a half. Like this morning I got up
and watched AMVs.....
