| My baby took our love
|  And then she rolled it up
|  Rolled it up a hill
|  Like a ball of snow
|  Like a snowball grows
|  Until it gets too big
|  Until she lost control

| Everything is fucked up
|  It's all coming down

| Why can't you have your cake and eat it too?
|  Why believe in things that make it tough on you?
|  Why scream and cry when you know its through?
|  Why fall in love when theres better things to do?

A Glance, A Stance, A Broken Romance, A Disconnected Telephone.

I've got to let you know, I'd cry if you died.
