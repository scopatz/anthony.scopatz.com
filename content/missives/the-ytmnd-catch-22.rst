So I just submitted my fist YTMND. You can see it at
http://neempwnsnedm.ytmnd.com/

It kinda sucks I know. But hey it was my first one, right. No! The
internet is a harsh mistress. within one minute I got a vote of one star
and a comment that said I could do better and recomened an epic sword
fight between happycat and the seal.

Ok so here is the catch. Even if I spent an enourmous amount of time
making such a gif and then putting it together and putting it up there,
the likelyhood that someone won't hate it imeadiately is pretty low. So
really, unless you are a genius at starting new fads, I would recomend
that you take the hit in the polls and not put much effort into it...or
really don't care. Oh well. The Intarweb is a cold harsh place...kinda
like the real world.
