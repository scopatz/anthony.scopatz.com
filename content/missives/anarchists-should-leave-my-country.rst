Anarchists should leave my country:

I had this dream last night that featured most of my friends from Morgan
Hill. We were trying to build a pier out of 2x4s ala Jason Christopher
style. Everyone was their current age and in their current relationships
(mostly). I remember swimming around a lot and treading water while
Julie Sullivan was there hitting me on the sole of my foot with the nail
end of her nail board. I asked Jason to make her stop after my pleas
went unheeded.

The General is still in the fog, however, much more has been revealed.
He no has a map of the area and a fighting chance for some of the
company to survive if he can navigate his way out of this gauntlet of
woe. If but only he could read the map.
