With Michael reading "Game of Thrones", I am getting into it seriously
again. It is bad. But I really can't talk about it anymore, because he
reads this too! But he made it past the first 80 pages without throwing
it down (I am looking at you, Anthony).

Suffice to say, that it has gotten to the point where I have felt this
real compulsion to play some 2 Ed. AD&D or, barring that, Castles &
Crusades or HackMaster or something. Something with gulldamn'd Gnomes.

However, I have found ways to satiate myself in other ways, thankfully.
One of them is of course the IRL OKCupid Minigame. The other is more
oblivious.

Ain't the Total Package yet, but is so wrong to want more ass?

PS Little edgy as tonight is Yom Kippur. Never know when Israel will
implode or Synagogues fired upon. It seems wrong that there are
justifiable neuroses on what is arguably the second most important
holiday. I \*still\* find the Tet offensive.

PPS Is anyone else disturbed by the amount of Sarah Palin-esque
straight-male-targeted porn that is popping up on the internet these
days? I mean, maybe it existed before but we just didn't know who Sarah
Palin was....
