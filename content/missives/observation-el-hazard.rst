| Zen Joke:
|  What did Harry Potter spend all of his boxing money on?
|  Ballet.

This has been on my mind for about a week now because once I realized it
I was really delighted and also sickened and then enamored with the
genius of Frank Herbert.

And now that I have dropped the FH name I know I ave lost at least half
of you.

Ok here is the deal. We all know (all of us still reading that is) that
Lady Jessica is the not-so-love child of Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
Mohiam and Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.

Now a lot is in a name in Dune. Frank Herbert admitted that he chose the
name Gesserit because it sounds like Jesuit. Furthermore, there are
other examples like the fremen Jamis, which sounds oddly like Janus.
Furthermore Jamis can be said to be two-faced since he is wrong about
Paul and Jessica in life but his death justifies their further living.
Hell, even fremen is a thinly disguised "free men".

Ok back to our Reverend Mother. I believe that she, too, is an Atreides.

Here is my proof.

To start with recall your Ancient Greek and remember that Atreides
literally means "Son of Atreus". As such, Atreides is a commonly used
epithet in the Iliad and the Odyssey describing Atreus' sons. Namely the
heros Agamemnon and Menelaus.

Now, whether you know it or not the Atreides of Dune claim to be direct
male descendents of Atreus. Clearly then they are either from Menelaus
or Agamemnon.

Suffice it to say Agamemnon was kind of a shitty father.

Menelaus however was the right and proper husband of....Helen!

That is right, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam shares not just a
family name of the Atreides but arguably one of the most important
Atreides names. Furthermore, it is well established the Atreides hand
down names from generation to generation (eg Leto).

Even more so, Gaius is a Roman name. Frank Herbert is playing a game in
that the Greeks and Greek thought essentially became the Romans.

As for her last name, Mohiam's mother was probably Atreides herself and
Bene Gesserit to boot. Her mother however was ordered to mate with a
male from some other blood line. Mohaim is not known to have ever
married.

So what is weird about this?

Well this implies that the Bene Gesserit interbreeding between Atreides
and Harkonnen was going on much more than the one generation. They
wanted Paul who was both A and H to be female to wed with Feyd-Rautha.
However, if Gaius Helen Mohiam was also Atreides, then Lady Jessica was
also both A and H and she married Duke Leto and bore Paul! This is two
generations of first cousins marrying that we know of!

In summary, Frank Herbert is a sick but amazing bastard that rox my sox.

I am sure you are all glad to know that I finished rereading Dune, so
\*maybe\* I will stop talking about this.

Through not getting the Zen Joke, you get it.
