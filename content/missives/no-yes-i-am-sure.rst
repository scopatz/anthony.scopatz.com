No, Yes, I am Sure

A funny thing happened on the way to the terminal from the other
terminal, at Starbucks.

I am on my way to the DoE Fuel Cycle Research & Development meeting in
Washington DC.  (I am assuming I can talk about it since `my face is on
the website!`_)  As I write this, however, I am in the Charlotte
airport.

I went to Starbucks to try to buy my overpriced dinner.  Here was the
conversation I had at least three times with two people:

| Barista:Do you want a bag?
|  Me:  No thanks, it is OK.  [No need for more bags, right?]
|  Barista: Would you like a fork for your fruit cup?
|  Me: No thank you.  [I have a bamboo utensil kit in my luggage.]
|  Barista: Are you sure you don't need a bag?
|  Me: Yes, thank you though.

Maybe peeps in the NC just \*really\* like bags and plastic forks.  I
can't say as I blame them.
