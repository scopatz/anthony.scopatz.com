Ok, instead of bitchin' about how much I hate Dan and how much of a
Pussy he is for taking advantage of the closest slutty girl he could
find, instead of illustrating the multitude of ways I would like to
find him at graduation with his parents and scream "Fuck You, I hope
your dick rots off and your mom eats it in front of you and you know
what she enjoys the tatse...too bad it is a one time thing!" Instead of
this I will post some of the email conversation that Syd and I have
been having.<br><br><br>Me:<br>Hey All,<br><br>We
will be playing again tonight. Same deal as last time, I'll try to find
a place and then you can call me and see where I am am. Also we will
once again start at 8 and plan to go till 11. <br><br>Just looking at my calander This may be our third or second to last game, so be prepared to kick some ass and take some names.<br><br>Hope to see you there!<br>Tony<br><br>Syd: <br>Tone
I am not sure if I will be there tonight. I am really exhausted this
week and though we have so few games left I don't know if I'll make it.
Maybe I will but be prepared if I don't show up. I don't know how I got
so tired... Did you go to sarah's last night? I left early I have been
tired all week. Are you eating lunch in DLG at noon any time soon? I
was there on Friday expecting to see you but didn't.<br>SIGh<br>syd<br><br>Me:<br>Syd,<br><br>Ok
perhaps it is for the best. There is always a place at my table for yo
uas long as I have a table. I did not go to Sarah's last night, but
that is a long story for an email and I care not to discuss it here. <br><br>I
will be at lunch at DLG at noon every day this week with the possible
exception of friday. I was not there on last friday at noon which
brings me to an interesting point. I spyed a certain Cassius eating at
my Dining Common on friday. If good will is to remain in this world, I
trust this behavior will cease. Unspoken agreements mean nothing on
this campus as I have come to learn once again, so now I have committed
it to words.<br><br>I would like to see you, and to hang out in my
limitted time left. If, however on the off chance (though I do not
rationally believe this, yet), you are avoiding me, then please I beg
of you to tell me straight up. If you want to fully break off contact I
can accept that. No harm, no foul. I am also willing to admitt that I
am completely misreading the situation. The truth, as always, likely
lies somewhere in the middle.<br><br>Know that I always think better of you in person.<br><br>Be Well<br>Anthony<br><br>PS there is a squad of ducklings in the lagoon.  Have you seen them?<br><br>Syd:<br>dear tone<br>yes i saw the ducklings on friday aft when i skipped my section to watch them!<br>actually
i skipped my section because i was tired and lazy and wound up being so
glad that i had because i saw the first ducklings of the year.<br>he
who must not be named ate in DLG on friday? sorry, ill see about
that... funny i didn't see anybody who must not be named there. unless
you mean somebody else i dont know about, erstwhile stalkers and so
forth.<br>you know you are not the only one to be upset about the
situation between you and he who must not be named. he who must not be
named is pretty upset about it too, and about the discomfort it causes
our friends. it is all really my responsibility--it is i who should be
accused, and if there is anything i can do to resolve this between you
too i insist that you let me know.<br>it is not true that you were not
friends. your friendship simply did not look like any friendship i have
ever had--but as another distinct individual i have no right to impose
those standards on others.<br>--i just saw a japanese man frighten himself with his own umbrella...the things you see in here...--<br>i
have however kept mum about that option you hinted at to me (vis a vis
working toward resolving situation) as you also hinted that if i did
not keep mum all options would be null and void.<br>what a cryptic conversation this is.<br>hope to see you at lunch tomorrow...<br>i am not avoiding you although i have thought many times this week how it must appear such as we have not hung out lately.<br><br>Me:<br>Dear Syd,<br><br>Thanks for being frank with me.  It joys my heart that you are not avoiding me. <br><br>Also
I owe you an extreme thanks for handling the
DLG-The-One-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named-Here situation. I have been fretting
since friday trying to find a socially acceptable way to approach the
matter. I am sorry for putting you in this position and this was never
my intent. However I believe it will work better than any other. <br><br><br>"he
who must not be named is pretty upset about it too, and about the
discomfort it causes our friends. it is all really my
responsibility--it is i who should be accused, and if there is anything
i can do to resolve this between you too i insist that you let me know."<br><br>Furthermore,
You know that I do not belive the situation is your responsibility
(besides it wasn't in the stars, more tomorrow). Part of the
responsibility is mine, for I knew and accepted such terms to a
relationship with you. The other part is squarely his. If you are ever
in my situation (which I hope you won't be) you will understand more
directly. In fact the responsibility in this situation have very little
to do with you specifically and more with who you are abstractrly and
percieved violations to a possibly outdated code of honor which I
adhere to. I have spoken to you of this before and you know that I have
my reasons and compulsions for believing in (at least for myself)
things like monogomy etc. It pains me as well how this has affected us
all and our friends. Although I think I have trouble distiguishing this
hurt from the sadness of leaving.<br><br>Thank you for keeping mum about it. <br><br><br>"it is not true that you were not friends."<br>This means more to me than you know.<br><br><br>" --i just saw a japanese man frighten himself with his own umbrella...the things you see in here...--"<br>That
so reminds me of Trigun...which you would love at least the first half
of...actually you might like most of it. After the halfway point it
gets a little darker (which is cool for a kids show) but sadly less
slapstick. On the other hand, the second half contains way more of this
super bad ass priest character.<br><br>

I hope to see you tomorrow.<br><br>Be Well, Kaire<br>Tony<br><br><br>If you read all that, I salute you.
