**t'asoiaf';dr - I am moving to Chicago.**

Dear Ser Erick,

Upon forging my chain and becoming a maester in mine own right, I regret
to inform you that cannot remain in your leal service.  My time spent in
study in these southron lands must come to an end.  I have heard the
call; the realms need me.

I have decided to take the black.  The Wall needs as much support as it
can muster.  Maesters are in short supply to help fight back the dread
things stirring in the uncivilized lands to the north.  I will enter the
ranks as a steward to research the coming troubles.  Castle Black has
excellent resources and premier library.  However, it is my
understanding that I will spend much of my time in the Gift, on the
Wall's southside, on a plain known as Hyde Park.

Please wish me good tidings in this venture.  I know I had planned to
stay within this kingdom for many more years, but the shifting sands of
fate conspire to place me elsewhere.

| Health & Wealth,
