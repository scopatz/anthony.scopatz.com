Here are some Post-Partum Valentines Day musings.

Awhile ago I found `this`_ article online. At the time i sent it to
Robin and we had a good discussion about it. The basic gist of it is on
a neurological level, primate tool use comes down to a subtle mind trick
that other animals don't have. This trick, as it turns out, is that we
primates fool our minds into thinking that the tool that we are using is
actually part of our own body.

The science behind this is interesting (the exact same sequence of
synapses firing irrespective of tool a tool being in hand or not).
However, this interested me less than the social ramifications of such a
discovery.

It is easy to understand how we may trick ourselves into believing that
simple tools are actually part of our greater corpus. But what does this
kinda thing mean for body modification? Piercings, silicone horns, etc
are all actually part of your body! If you were to cover yourself in
scarp metal (ala Tetsuo: The Iron Man), this would be your new body.
Your mind wouldn't know the difference.

If this seams like a stretch, then consider some of our more complicated
tools. Nearly everyone has driven a car. After a while driving and after
"getting used to" a vehicle, in some sense driving becomes natural.
Think about that, driving is one of the most unnatural day-to-day
experiences there is. But we all know the feeling. Very few long time
drivers while driving think of themselves as explicitly being in a car,
driving. The car is, in the driver's mind, part of them.

Ok so that was all old hat for some people. Here is the new, juicy
stuff.

| Here are a couple of canonical relationship phrases:
|  1) "You are just using me."
|  2) "Two are as (become) one."

So the amazing thing about this primate stuff is that it offers an
avenue for a proof of the equivalence of those two statements.
Furthermore it means that 1) is not a bad thing and 2) is not sappy.

Here is how the argument goes. When people are physically touching and
moving and trying to manipulate each other, each person is regarding the
other as a tool in the primate brain way (not emotionally). However,
since the other person is a tool (in some sense), the first person's
mind is thus incorporating the other into their perception of their own
body by necessity!

Thus we have a situation where two individuals each have subsumed the
other into their body.

The natural situation where this comes up is sex (though wrestling may
count). As with all primates, there is some learning time that goes into
fooling you mind to thinking your tool is a part of you. This explains
why long time partners are more apt to say "You are just using me for
sex!" and that "It feels right" and "I couldn't live with out you" with
their spouse.

The fact that there is a basis for these otherwise ridiculous statements
amazes me still.

So go ahead! Use your partner, because really, at the end of the day,
you are just using yourself. And that, my friend, is called
masturbation.
