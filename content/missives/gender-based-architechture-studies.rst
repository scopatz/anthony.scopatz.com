So I am still in the closet, but not for the lack of trying.

My mom pulled an all-nighter last night and was not awake for to take us
to the storage space yesterday to get the furniture. Instead, Shane and
I went to the dump, put polyacrylic finish on the bedroom door, re-hung
the two doors and painted the guest closet a light pink. All of this
does not seem like it would take particularly long, but we spent 8 hours
on it. The job was made more difficult by the fact that it was raining
hard today.

The hight point of the day was when we were out of money so I offered to
leave my little bother at the dump as a form of payment to the
attendant. Shane was not amused.

Julian is still in school so our War III was limited to two games.

Hopefully my mom will be awake tomorrow and I'll finally be able to come
out of the closet.
