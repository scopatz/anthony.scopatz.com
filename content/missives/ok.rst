The Last Post was an OKCupid test I just took.

I thought it was really sad that I (of all people) got higher than 96%
on Philosophy. I mean my god people...that is two standard deviations
from the mean. Maybe it is just that the average person on OKCupid is
not all that philisophical...but still, People, come on...care a bit.

This is why I am convinced that we don't live in a true democracy...we
don't force people to vote. So many forms of government just don't
transfer very well when you reach a certain number of people. To retain
citizenship you should have to care. I mean maybe not to Heinleinian
depths...but at least a little.
