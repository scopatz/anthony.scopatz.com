I am now in the home stretch here. This semester has been largely
positive. I have luckily been afforded a good deal of time to learn a
lot of programing this semester. Of course this is all ostensibly under
the guise of learning things for school, which is not wholly the case.

I am hoping the system will not eat me up and spit me out again, but
that is what will likely happen when I try to oppose it next year.

My Awesome Table is in my room.

I am trying to teach Julian to program. I think the process will be much
speeded up since he finally got his super sweet computer to dual boot
Linux and Win XP. The weapon of choice is, of course, python. He
certainly has a talent for dealing with computers and other algorithmic
complex systems like automobiles. I think this indicates that he is good
at modularizing information and processing it quickly. Hopefully at his
young age he'll be able to get past the formalism that is structured
programming. If he does, he'll be golden. This will lend years of high
school for successful development that were not afforded me.
