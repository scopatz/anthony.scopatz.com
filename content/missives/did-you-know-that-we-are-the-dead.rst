The time has come. This is a Action News 8 Breaking Coverage: Javilina
report!

First up, at one point yesterday I hit an unprecedented 162 stalks per
week! For those of you who do not use the site, this is simply how many
people have viewed your profile in the aforementioned time allotment.

| Secondly, yesterday there were some simply amazing IM exchanges that I
just \*have\* to publish here. This thread is locked because of this. I
mean we can all have a good laugh at these people, but really should the
general public? It is not like we are Anonymous, though some of us may
be traps.

|  Every time I see your picture I think you're someone else. Stop
tricking me!! :P

| **=====javilina wrote=====**
|  LoL! That is totally funny. Who do you think I am?!

| **=====AdventureTeamGO wrote=====**
|  Haha, I donno, just someone different. You tricky person you.

| **=====javilina wrote=====**
| Sweet! maybe I am ghost from your past. I mean, as long as I am being
tricky ;)

|  Yup, I've been stalking your profile, and decided that I have a
question for you now that I worked up the nerve to send you a message.
Your pet guinea pigs...would they happen to be named after characters
from Dune? Just curious. :)

| **=====javilina wrote=====**
|  Lol, They totally are! I love those books. You are the first person
to notice it tho. At least the first one on OK Cupid that is.

But yeah, I totally love Dune. I like to think that I am named after
Lady Jessica even though I know I am not. (great aunt, whatevs!) But
since my guinea pigs are like my kids right now I named them like they
were. Paul came first of course.

| **=====OmegaSupreme wrote=====**
| Heh, awesome! I figured they had to be. Not many people would really
come up with the name Duncan just out of the blue. :) So I take it your
name must be Jessica? I love Dune as well, although I have to admit that
I only made it halfway through Children of Dune. One of these days I'm
going to have to start that series over again, and finish it this time.
I've also got both of the Sci Fi Channel miniseries on Dune and Children
of Dune. I like them much better than the older David Lynch movie.

| **=====javilina wrote=====**
| Heya, yeah Dune is pretty amazing.  I really like Children tho!  You
should totally pick it back up.  I dunno, I like both the movie so...

| **=====OmegaSupreme wrote=====**
| Yeah, what I read of Children was pretty good. I do need to start it
again. BTW, I heard they're going to make a new Dune movie. Not sure
what to think of that news yet...I'm not sure the story can really be
told properly in a 2 or 3 hour movie.
