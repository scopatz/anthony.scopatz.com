in my limited contact with her has done the same. "I would love
to hang out", but she's always busy. Here is the confusing thing, if
she didn't want to, she just wouldn't respond to my emails right? But
she does respond, but we still don't do anything, Gaaah. I have decided
to wait a week before re-attempting contact. I contacted her 3 times
last week and we only did the one thing. Is a week enough? Oh well, I
am busy myself right now because of....<br><br>Grad School! First Texas
really wants me. Then, they say they are concerned about how my grades
took a dip Junior year (They did NOT read my personal Statement wherein
all of this was explained.) Which is essentially saying the same thing
as we don't want you (to my emotional state at least). But in the same
breath as "concerned about my grades" they also invited me out to texas
to tour the place. WTF. I think this trip to Austin will essentially
make or break my grad school oppertuinity next year. Which really means
that this is an interview from which I cannot go home and cry. I think
I will just have to tell them straight up why my grades fell and then
explain that those problems will go away if I move 2000 miles from
home, and then hope they have mercy on my carrer as a scientist.<br>
<br>Mixed Signals, Man.  Life is really weird.</td></tr>
