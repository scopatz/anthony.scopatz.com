Wooohooo! I am officially now on vacation!

We have a publication ready to submit in just a few weeks! If you know
anything about Academia, this is very fast. And now that it is done I am
Freeeeeeeee.........

I will be here on the eastern seaboard until the Saturday 5th. From
there I head to Council Bluffs, Iowa until the Wednesday the 9th.

But after that I have the option, and have cleared it with
mommy-dearest, of going to the Bay Area for a few days. I am not sure
how long it will take me to drive from Iowa to SF/Morgan Hill but I
would expect to be there on Friday the 11th.

So if you are going to be in town and if anyone is organizing a Silent
Film Festival run let me know.

If I do come to the Bay Area this weekend, be forewarned, that this will
be my only visit this summer. Hope to seeya there!
