| If you knew how I longed
|  for you now that you're go-o-o-one,
|  you'd grow wings and fly home to me, home tonight.

| Little killer froggy where did you hop?
|  Under the entertainment center, realized you just couldn't stop.

| I almost died,
|  It was so embarrassing.
|  But I am alive
|  so that you can fall in love with me.
|  So Pu-Pu-Put you hand in my back pocket,
|  as if it were your own back pocket.

| Ah, che Luna, Oh, che Mare,
|  with such a moon and such a sea.
|  And You and Me.

| Brown shoes don't make it.
|  Brown Shoes, why fake it?

| It's Business,
|  It's Business Time.

So much fag-haggery *in der Naehe*.
