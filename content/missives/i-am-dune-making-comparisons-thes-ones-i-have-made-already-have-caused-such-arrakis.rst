The Israeli's are secretly the Bene Gesserit.

There I said it.

Let's look at the facts. This recent Palestinian civil war is an amazing
feat of strategy in terms of the Sisterhood's ghols. Think about it. The
Israeli goal is, more or less, to survive as a state. Unfortunately,
they are a country surrounded by countries that either don't want them
in the region (Iraq, Iran, Yemen, UAE, etc.), countries they have
conquered and forced peace out of (Lebanon and Egypt), or Jordan who
doesn't want to be in the cross fire. Furthermore, internationally
Israel has gotten a lot of flack for some of its practices in varied
fields. yet they are still tolerated everywhere.

The only thing they aren't doing is a forced breeding program.

It is optional. This Fatwa-Hamas conflict has the Bene Gesserit
signature all over it. Israel is in ultimate control of the situation
here. They could move in at any moment and declare martial law and stop
the fighting, but that would be considered rude. It is possible that
everything in the past, their whole degradation of their own reputation
would just be to prove that they are fundamental more organized than
their opponents. They have the Other Memories. If they didn't plan this
then they are certainly taking amazing advantage of the situation.

On another note, I am pretty sure Isaac Asimov founded Ix.
