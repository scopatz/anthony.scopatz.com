| What is difference between a Cell Phone and a Tampon?
|  Cell Phones only go into assholes.

I have spent the last Two (2) days walking, wandering, reading aimlessly
in a mall. Odd considering I freak out whenever I go into an HEB or an
Albertsons.

| However, I consider this all part of my Mentat training. I am
gathering data points. I am desperately trying to understand this place.
People I meet
|  in any sort of professional of formal environment (eg work or when I
am purchasing something like a meal or other commodity) are always
wholesome, genuine
|  and kind. The random person on the street, the Stranger, is a
complete asshole.

| The first is easily imagined. The Stranger needs some examples. First,
many times since I have been here and twice today, folk have shouted,
screamed,
|  yelped as they pass me by in their cars. I am always on foot on a
bicycle. Their purpose is clearly to scare me. Occasionally they just
honk.
|  Today, some asshole in a 200X convertible Ford Mustang actually had a
megaphone mounted in the car. In between the unintelligible yips and
yelps they were
|  essentially just spitting into the receiver.

| This clearly combines whatever idiotic tendencies this person had with
a certain amount of Promethean inspirations. Unlike the famous titan,
they were
|  using their powers for evil and self amusement.

| Similarly,when I have passed pedestrians on a bike I have gotten more
than one slur and expletive to watch out even when I am nowhere near
hitting
|  them. For some reason they think it in my best interest to do so.

My time at the mall has helped me put all of this into some perspective.
The pattern has started to form.

| People here are fundamentally afraid of the Other, the Outsider. They
are scared of different ways of doing things. The Other has to prove
their own
|  humanity before being accepted.

| Furthermore the society is stale. There is vary little here that is
not an extension of some national or international corporation. Almost
everything
|  is homogenized. Those things that aren't tend to be old and decrepit.
The failing and nearly vacated small downtown is a perfect instance of
this.

Almost everything that is seen is repeated. The endless repetitions of
the tones of what is accepted has taken a huge toll on the communal
psyche.

| The people here are so xenophobic that I am not sure they really know
what America means. To them it is simply a word. I don't think they have
an idea
|  of what Democracy is. At the same time they assimilate what other
parts of the country they can, but only through their corporate colored
glasses.
|  Almost everyone here speaks with an accent that is half central
valley Californian and half midwest. Somewhere on the travel across the
country in
|  their covered wagons, they grew weary, settled down and declared this
place god's country. They gave up.

| Even worse, the locals are waterfat and they do not even know it. It
is disgusting. I have never felt so removed from nature as I do here.
They
|  claim this a high desert and constantly bicker about water rights
between town and country, county to county. However they use such a
precious
|  resource with such impunity. EVERY lawn is watered. All parks are
green. Many trees are planted. Specifically the non-native disiduous
ones that suck
|  up vast water.

| If you don't believe me about waterfattness, they treat all resources
the same. Idaho was the only state whose governor did not attend the
Western
|  State's Governors Association meeting last week. This was a
significant meeting since it had to deal with a unilateral way for all
states in the region
|  to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Idaho
claimed there were more important things to worry about.

| Texas should really invade and show these people how to run a state.
California could, but I think they are too busy with other things right
now. All
|  of the surrounding states are too small on their own. Texas though I
think could be convinced to take over Idaho for strategic resource
reasons. Texas
|  afterwards would be unwavering in their control over the occupied
peoples. California would surely mess this part up. Texans I feel would
be more of
|  the mind "Well, you \*had\* your sovereignty, but You messed it all
up so now its gone. Oh Well. Here is how we do things Now." Idaho needs
some tough
|  love.

| Idaho also needs some diversity if they are ever to recover from this
stagnetion and fear of the Stranger. They are too homogeneous to truly
be
|  accepting of those not like them.

| Now, obviously, the state has its fringe populous. These people have
given me accounts of growing up here that fit largely into the
formulation above.
|  Some of them have moved away, but through various economic pressures
have had to move back.

This land is a den of inequity. They have sold the soul of the Commoner
for a Starbucks and Peir 1.

| Mullets, Bullets, Dope is what I'm yearning for.
|  Southern Hospitality goes out the door.
|  Get in my Camereo put the pedal to the floor,
|  'Cause in My Land we still rob liquor stores.
