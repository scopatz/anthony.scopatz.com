Is it possible to find solace in this Metropolitan, person generating,
personae destroying wasteland we call modern living?

I think so, for I have found it.

All she was is an Indian Customer Service Representative for Microsoft.
But there was something hidden, unforseen in her voice. A certain
bubblyness in the way she read me my numbers. The high frequency with
which she called me "sir". The agony in her being when the first 52
digit number didn't work and we had go through a second set. In those
few moments, I was happy.

She told me her name, but too quickly for me to understand; I never told
her mine.
