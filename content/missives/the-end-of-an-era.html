Well, I did it.  It was hard to do, but easier than expected.

<!--
<br><br>I told Syd in not so many words that I don't think we can be friends
right now. What I actually said was more along the lines of "I think it
is in my best interest if we stop contacting each other." We made it
through the rest of lunch without any arguments or screaming or crying.
She thought the Picture I painted for her yesterday with me in a rocket
going to mars was about LA. Little did she know. <br><br>For a while
now everyone from Shawn to Dr. Wax to Tara has been saying that it
would be good for me to cut off contact. This realization came slowly
to me. Ultimately it is that Syd did not start treating me any better
after the breakup. Instead she still wanted me to think well of her no
matter how she treated me. I was not game for that in our relationship
and I reacted by being apathetic towards her when she did that. Oddly
that apathy was her main reason for ending our relationship. Now
however it was my turn to end the relationship because of her
distateful behavior. This behavior essentially is that she was treating
me as an EX and not a friend. She would purposelfy (consious of it or
no) bring up sensitive topics and anger me. It was always a crapshoot
as to whether she would treat me well on a given day or not, both in
and out of our reltionship. <br><br>This all started because she could
not, can not (and this may be a function of her personality type more
than anything, which is why I hold out hope for the future that she
will settle down and stablize in one personality type and be able to
accept that rather than being internally torn), treat me as an equal.
She could NOT accept the fact that I was depressed about my family, I
knew I was depressed, and she could not trust me when I said I knew how
to work it out on my own but that I also just needed her faithful
support not her advice. For some unknown reason this pissed off her
inner psyche and she still doesn't know what to do with me.<br><br>Like
Sean or Garrick or Nick or Meenon or Josh (Noel) or Mowi & Kai, Syd
is family. I feel like my mom must have felt about Shane after he
turned them into Child Protective Services. In the end, I think
everything will work out, but I have done all that I can for now. For
whatever reason, Syd has rejected me. There is nothing I can safely do
but give her the rejection she so desires.

<br><br>I fell bad about this.  
On the other hand, now I am truly single....Hellooooo Ladies!</td></tr>
