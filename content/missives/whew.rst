>>>OK<<<

All of my apologies are out! If you got one, I am sorry. Some of them
proved to be unfounded but others I am still downright giddy about.

There really is something to be said for this tradition. You know even
if it doesn't work the first, second, or Nth year, next year it just
might. And then you can treat people like human beings and move forward
into the future together.

This week is very very cramped though. I have a presentation the day
after Yom Kippur and the professor is Jewish even. But I also have to
have a paper ready to submit on Sunday at 4pm. And of course, a day and
a half are taken out of this week because of Yom Kippur itself and I am
still working on backlog from last week's New Year.

And sometime in all of this I need to fit in more yeast infections.

Grrr Busy Smash.
