So I think the trick to graduate school is the ability to work really,
extremely hard on something that you generally feel is a distraction.
Then after such a herculean effort, the further ability to fully admit
that this thing that you just built completely and utterly sucks.
Congratulations, you have just made a worthless piece of crap!

I mean you had the inkling before hand that it might have sucked a
little. I mean you have done this before, right? You know some of the
pitfalls...but not all of them. And after all, that is what editing is
for. To catch this stuff before you embarrass yourself in front of any
one except your adviser. Someday, though. Someday.

Someday, you just might get it right on the first try. After all, you
can at least fake being smart. And you have this *corpus* of work behind
that proves that you might have known something at some point in the
past. This time it can't be that hard to bust out, again.

But then, think what you have sacrificed. You don't have any friends. No
social life to speak of. A few hours on Friday nights and Saturdays
spent doing chores. You haven't had sex, let alone good sex, in years.
And the words that you pen are only fit for burning. This hardly seems
worth it.

Jeeze, am I glad that I am not some of my colleagues!
