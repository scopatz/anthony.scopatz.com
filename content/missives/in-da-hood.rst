In da' hood!

So I finally after an excruciating day in the airports made it out of
the City and into the Country. I am at long last on vacation.

I would like to point out that the Denver airport is the most wasteful
goddamn use of technology I have ever seen. do they really need two
internal monorails to shuffle bodies from one side of the airport to the
other? Am I cursed to feel disgust for humanity every time I leave
Austin. Misanthropy is common if not expected when going to places like
Houston or some other soul crushing megalopolis. Detest in Colorado is
another matter.

In any event, I made it.

My parent's house is certainly improving, though by no means done. There
is now flooring in about 70% of the house and walls everywhere. Tonight
I am sleeping in the closet again. Hopefully this will be the last time
as we are doing a Storage Space/Guest room furniture shuffle tomorrow
and then going to the bastion of civilization called Santa Maria to buy
a mattress. At this poitn I will then be in the guest bedroom. There are
no curtains in here yet, so I may have to improvise. Furthermore, the
toilet for the guest bath will be delivered on Monday.

It was good to see my brothers.

I wish I had my "song of ice and fire" books here...
