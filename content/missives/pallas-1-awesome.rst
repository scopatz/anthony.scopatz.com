I was planning on writing this yesterday, but if you follow my twitter
you would know that I completely broke my system while moving to the
latest stable kernel release (2.6.28). This was not without purpose; I
needed my computer to function a bit better for work and also I needed
to add iPod support since I just bought my brother's used one. Luckily,
*mah 1337 h/-\\ckz0rz skillz* came in handy and the whole process only
took me like 6 hours. It would have been less, but I only had the broken
machine on hand!

So before I go further, Pallas Beltane was amazing. I really did love
it. It was held at the `Recreation Plantation`_, which is moderately in
the boonies but has every amenity. Basically, a 40+ acre facility in the
hill country.

The area is zoned into three regions.

#. Up by the gate there is a light field and some trees and the house
   where the proprietor live.
#. Through a strand of oaks, there are some camp sites and hot showers
   and it is generally woody.
#. This falls off a 14 foot hill down to a field with a couple of
   pavilions and a pool. The other border of the field is a creek (which
   was dry).

Naturally, my first thought was **LARP**. The entire facility was
basically made for dressing up (or the alternative) and running around.
The fee to rent the whole place out for the weekend was like $1k. Well
within most RP budgets.

I camped down by the creek with all of the other low-land gorillas.
There wasn't a lot of organized activity, but there did not really need
to be either. All in all, I had a wonderful time.

**ADDENDUM:** Some further posts may locked as appropriate.
