Over the past month I have had *a lot* of conversations about veganism, the personal 
choice to become vegan, the philosophical justifications for being vegan, and of 
course delicious vegan food. There are many reasons to be vegan and it seems to be
`an ideaological past time <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism#Philosophy:_ethical_and_environmental_perspectives>`_
to debate their relative merits. 

What I realized over the course of these discussions is that I do not seem to 
care precisley why I am vegan. I agree and comply with all of the standard 
justifications as well as having an individual credo which extends beyond this. 
For argument's sake I'll choose a position when forced though I feel that it is
a manufactured way of having a dialog. That I am vegan is enough.

In a practical sense, that one is a vegan ought to be enough for any other 
other vegan.  In fact, often times it is not.
