Over the past month I have had *a lot* of conversations about veganism, the personal 
choice to become vegan, the philosophical justifications for being vegan, and of 
course delicious vegan food. There are many reasons to be vegan and it seems to be
`an ideaological past time <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism#Philosophy:_ethical_and_environmental_perspectives>`_
to debate their relative merits. 

What I realized over the course of these discussions is that I do not seem to 
care precisley why I am vegan. I agree and comply with all of the standard 
justifications as well as having an individual credo which extends beyond this. 
For argument's sake I'll choose a position when forced though I feel that it is
a manufactured way of having a dialog. That I am vegan is enough.

In a practical sense, that one is a vegan ought to be enough for any other 
other vegan.  In fact, often times it is not. There are three arguments that are 
largely independent though they all arrive at the vegan acts: anti-suffering, 
environmental, and personal purity. 

How important is a belief in each of these? Is it valuable to believe in all of 
them or is a belief in one equivalent to believing in more than one? Given a 
metric jointly weigh these three arguments how important are external arguments?

I posit that since all argumnets are independent

1. belief in one does not preclude a belief in any other, 
2. the arguments cannot be ranked, and 
3. a belief in more is better than belief in fewer as it diminishes the 
   likelihood of accidental infractions of veganism.

The following is a short dicussion of the main arguments for veganism in light of the 
three supositions above.

Minimization of Suffering
=========================
This position is often called "ethical veganism."  I dislike this term because it
implies that other reasons for being vegan are somehow less ethical, less 
justified, or less meaningful.  That said, the tenet of minimal suffering is the 
correct way to phrase this argument.

Suppose we were instead to justify the hedonistic inverse - the maximization of 
pleasure. Arguably, the more cpacity for intelligence a being has the greater its
potential to feel pleasure. In such a system, it would be allowable to cause pain 
and suffering to less intelligent creatures as long as the smarter ones experianced
a greater than commesurate pleasure - largely due to their increased capacity to 
feel pleasure.  Arguably the maximization of pleasure priciple is the status quo 
justification for animal abuse by humans - though the truth is probably closer to
apathy, nihlism, and cruelty.  

Maximizing pleasure falls apart under scrutiny.  Is it OK to slap your comatose 
mom?  Most people would say that it is not, and by extention it is wrong to hit 
anyone in a coma.  Can the person feel the hit?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  If they do, it 
is in a way that is very different than how us concious folks experiance it.  
People should not abuse the weak and infirm simply because they can. Failure to 
extend this to animals indicates a position of inate human superiority.  I don't 
belive in the divine right of humans as masters of the universe. 
Call me anti-specicist.

Minimization of suffering has the same problems with quantifying pleasure and pain
as a function of intellectual capacity. However, it errs on the side of less 
suffering.  A honey bee may not feel in the same way that a chimpanzee does but 
neither deserves avoidable suffering given whatever capacity they may have to 
feel it.  

Still, minimization of suffering is often a 'kingdomist' position.  Why stop at 
animals?  How much more can a krill feel than a phytoplankton?  At what point is 
Life important on its own? At what point a living thing unimportant and merely 
subservient to more complex life forms?  If our understanding of suffering is not 
necessary for its minimization, then all life's suffering ought to be minimized.

At the point where one starts fretting about the suffering of microbes, it is 
reasonable to start asking why Life is so important.  Most of the universe - to the 
best of our knowledge - does not contain life.  So the question goes, "Should the 
universe be free from the kinds of abuses humans perpetrate on animals?" This is 
is reminicant of the `rock ethic <http://books.google.com/books?id=GTX6YdPc954C&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=rock+ethic+mars+trilogy&source=bl&ots=DFC654ITuK&sig=YLu8bkPzUBD3mXqwh2iZwJE_D3o&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7w-tUvr0FOiqyAHdxICgBA&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA>`_
found in Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars Trilogy*.  It does not make sense to speak 
about the suffering of rocks or stars.  Yet perhaps the universe should be 
appreciated for what it is rather than what humans can make of it.  If you believe 
this then you have walked the path from anti-suffering to environmental veganism.

Environmentalism
================
The primary point in this argument is that veganism is tens to thosands of times
more efficient than alternatives.  Water usage is a great metric for this.
Vegatiarian products have to go through an animal's systems -- which requires the 
animal to be alive at some point.  Meat products are a one-time use of an animal 
and so the water required is not able to be amotorized over multiple uagagse.  
For example, consider to same caloric value coming from eggs versus chicken breat.
The water usage of chicken breast is much higher than that of the egg.  Both of these
are much higher than the water usage for the equivalent caloric content of corn 
which fed the chicken throughout its life.  

The ethical arguments for environmentalism are much discussed. 
They can, however, tend to specisism.  
"We should try to prevent large scale climate change so that we have an 
ecosystem to pass on to our children."  In such statements ours and our own are 
primary and the planet is secondary.  Veganism is thus a tool to prevent our 
own suffering and incidentally minimizes that of other species. 

Still, the environmentalist veganism provides a needed alternative to the 
anti-suffering argument.  This is because the basic metric is theoritcally 
meseaurable.  As seen above, if you don't believe in quatifiable suffering then you
are lead to question the underlying value of life in natural systems.  If instead 
you do believe that intra-life suffering is comparable then it is possible to 
say that perhaps certain animal by-products are less bad because they cause less 
suffering. Honey is the canonical example because bees arguably have much less 
capacity for suffering than large scale mamals.  

However, environmentalists veganism has no such quandries.  Bees - whether they 
can truly feel or not - is irrelevant to honey production.  Honey still requires
many times the amount of water as opposed to equivalent food stuffs such as sugar.

Thus in the limit where suffering becomes small or unintellagible, enviornmental and 
ecological justifications become more important and compelling as a justification 
for veganism.

Personal Purity
===============
This argument is often derided as being selfish, vain, and transitory.  Personal 
purity justifications span the gamut from trying to loose weight to "my body is 
a temple" to "I just feel better as a vegan."

However, what the putity argument has that the other arguments lack is a strong
sense of personal responsibility.  Veganism is something empowered by the individual.
It is not possible for anyone to be vegan for someone else in this belief. 

If someone has made the choice to be vegan or to remain vegan, this is presumably
because it brings them some measure of aesthitic or emotional satisfaction. I feel 
that knocking this argument down is inapproriate.  People should be allowed to 
enjoy life in whatever mechanism they choose so long as it does not cause implicate
them in other moral hazards. Veganism has none of these and should be accepted
on any terms.
