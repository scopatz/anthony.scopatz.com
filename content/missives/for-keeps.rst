I am worried I have become too normal. I feel the urge to burn all of my
clothes, dye my hair and generally start over.

Being different is by no means always a choice, nor is it always a good
thing. But I feel as if things that made me different in the past were
just signs that I am developmentally slow. I never had the compulsion to
say "go to outer space", or "live in another time period" that so many
people did as kids. Why did these both hit me in the last week?
Shouldn't I be over them by now? Fuck, I don't even remember most of my
childhood.

I wanted so much to be an adult, but now that it is here...It is like
life is one big groovy orgy and I recycled the invitation and told them
to stop wasting so much paper.

I clearly need to raise my freak flag higher, but how? Everything now
has a context, and subtext[1]. Even people that don't like to be labeled
are typified by "Doesn't Like to Be Labeled." It is a logical trap.
Doing anything is probably doing the wrong thing, and doing nothing is
falling into that trap.

|  1) Not that such things didn't have associated contexts before, I simply failed to realize them. Ostensibly because I am a slow.
