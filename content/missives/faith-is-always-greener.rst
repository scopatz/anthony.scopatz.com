Melody and Robin and I got into religious discussion where I think
Melody and I were both playing a very weak Devil's advocate half of the
time.

More or less, what I don't understand is why people (hard atheists, etc)
bag on Religion (as a concept) because specific religions in specific
times do harm and negatively influence people, where on the other hand
they give Science and/or Law and/or Medicine and other "rational"
pursuits of thought.

The so-called logical studies have been and will continue to be just as
much if not vastly more so tool of discrimination and hate and racism as
Religion ever has. I could sum this point in one word: Nazis. But really
there is so much more to the subjects of Nuclear, Chemical, Biological,
Mechanical Weapons, Jim Crow Laws, and Medical abuse and malpractice
that it isn't worth filling up this space entirely. Oh and then there is
that whole military industrial complex thing that we invented, whose
express purpose is of death and yet produced almost every innovation in
our kitchen today.

My basic point is that I think Religion is unjustly bashed. Not that it
doesn't sometimes deserve it. But it isn't as if the Pope speaks for all
faiths everywhere.

But on another level I get that some (few?) people have had their lives
negatively impacted by people whose minds have turned to hate and who
use their faith as a justification. This is especially painful with
family members. Which is what I am guessing leads some to denounce All
Religions as hateful and irrational.

But still I struggle. Isn't it the people that are being hateful and
irrational? And isn't Science and Logic, which are trumped for their
superiority, used hatefully just as or more often on a gross scale than
Religion?

And no, there is no excuse for Hate. Only intolerant of Intolerance,
right? I don't know; You decide! Maybe someone out there has some gem of
wisdom that my Yiddishe tuchas has missed.
