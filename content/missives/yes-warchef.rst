Hi!

I know I haven't posted in a while.

I only recently got back to Texas and have been busy since.

On the other hand, I just got my new and much improved website back up.

Take a look at http://www.scopatz.com/.

It is quite handsome and all web 2.0 and all that and I think more
accurately represents me than my old website.

I start work tomorrow.

Seeya around!
