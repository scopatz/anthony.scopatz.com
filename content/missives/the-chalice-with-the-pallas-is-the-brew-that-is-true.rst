Not Andrew here. This weekend deserves a post. However, this is my third
attempt. Maybe I should hire a ghost-writer. Getting the right blend of
serious, awesome, sultry, thoughtful, hilarious is difficult. I am not
that good of a writer. I can tell you all about possible health effects
of the uranium decay chain, but this weekend... Well you may as well be
up `Savannah River`_ without a paddle!

In truth, this should be many posts. Some of which I know how to write,
some I don't, and some I don't yet know even how I feel about.

Normally, My go-to for un-writeable posts is `slash or fan-fic`_. I even
know what comes next. (Char/Sayla go!) But given some thoughts running
through my mind, I'll leave the incredibly disturbing sex writing to
George R. R. Martin.

So maybe, when I am more awake, I will write a series of small and
pointed posts. Or maybe it will just have to wait until after
Flipside...
