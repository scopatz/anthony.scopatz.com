The panel discussion  in episode 32 raises the importance of code reproducibility for scientific work. Open source software is a great contributor towards that end. The panel gives examples related to those issues from perspectives: spaceflight engineering, healthcare modeling, and nuclear engineering.

<div>Jacob Barhak has diverse international background in engineering, computing science, and disease modeling. He was educated at the Technion Israel Institute of Tehnology. He aquired experience in manufacturing and healthcare modeling from the university of Michigan. The Reference Model for disease progression was self developed in 2012 and he currently pursues this development effort as a freelancer. His work can be accessed though the following site: <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/jacobbarhak/" target="_blank">http://sites.google.com/site/jacobbarhak/</a>  Jacob is a member of the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling &amp; Simulation in Healthcare.  <a href="https://simtk.org/home/cpms" target="_blank">https://simtk.org/home/cpms</a></div>

<div>Lealem Mulugeta is the current Project/Lead Scientist of NASA's Digital Astronaut Project (DAP), a key member of the project leadership responsible for all scientific content and direction of the project. The DAP is dedicated to implementing well-validated computational models to help predict and assess spaceflight health and performance risks, and to enhance the development of health risk countermeasure. Since joining DAP, among his many responsibilities, Lealem has played a strong role in the development and implementation of standardized methods for verification, validation and credibility assessment of NASA’s biomedical computational models. In doing so, he works very closely with highly multidisciplinary teams of researchers and engineers to develop and implement computational models for space biomedical research. Additional information about the DAP is available at: <a href="http://www.dsls.usra.edu/displays/digitalAstronaut.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dsls.usra.edu/displays/digitalAstronaut.pdf</a>  Lealem recently founded and Co-chairs the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling &amp; Simulation in Healthcare.  <a href="https://simtk.org/home/cpms" target="_blank">https://simtk.org/home/cpms</a>  Additionally, he is a member of the ASME V&amp;V40 Verification and Validation on Computational Modeling of Medical Devices: <a href="http://cstools.asme.org/csconnect/CommitteePages.cfm?Committee=100108782" target="_blank">http://cstools.asme.org/csconnect/CommitteePages.cfm?Committee=100108782</a></div>
