In case your not a complete nerd, the EIA (Energy Information
Administration) is the non-partisan statistical arm of U.S. Department
of Energy.  Most people would find the most of their site extremely
boring.  *"I brake for `Alabama's nuclear power profile`_."*

**But can you deny the cuteness of
 ENERGY ANT?!**

That's right.  The EIA has an absolutely amazing kids website, complete
with adorable mascot.  Their `nuclear page`_ starts off with an awesome
picture of the Sun and is otherwise remarkably even-handed and
informational.

However, my favorite page is by far `the interactive riddles`_.  Welcome
to my blog; welcome to puns I have stolen from children.

| **﻿Q:** In which part of the jail are energy criminals kept?
|  **A:** The fuel cells!

| **Q:** What did the solar cells say to their cloudy boss?
|  **A:** We need a rays!

| **Q:** How do energy-conscious people feel about wind power?
|  **A:** They are blown away!

| \ **Enter Haiku:**\ 
|  Hark, Energy Ant,
|  Red statistical thorax,
|  You are so dreamy.

Ok kids, write your own energy ant haiku in the comments!
