This is overdue, and was brought up a couple of times in my mind today.

As we approach this election there seems to be a lot of intolerance
whizzing about. And not just from you traditional right-wing
fundamentalist sources. I see it as much from my left leaning friends
and even those I would consider moderates too.

Frankly, people, this is unacceptable.

Our choices should not be reduced to "Hope or Die", "Drill or go fuck
yourself". Stephen Colbert, `in his interview on Fresh Air`_, talks
about fighting the Culture War.

Culture War? Is this what we want? Is another war of any sort really
needed? And this is exactly what he is fighting in. I am not
presupposing that he started it, but he certainly profits by its
continuation.

This path is treacherous. We could end up thrusting ourselves into
another edition of the 1960s. Or we could start another \*real\* civil
war. If you want two Americas, you can have it. **Is this what you
want?!** This is were we are going with are present dialogue, and lack
thereof. Even John Lennon wanted to be counted out of revolution.

But this can all be avoided if you (and a bunch of your friends) decide
to be more tolerant of those around you. I am not saying you need to
abandon your principles. However, I am asking that you distinguish
between you having an intense disagreement with an idea or belief and
hating those whom hold that belief.

| Disagree with them: Yes.
|  Despise them: No.

Maybe compassion is a virtue, and maybe you don't have the time, but I
swear you have something to gain by not thinking that half of the world
hates you because you hate them.

Here are a couple of hot button issues where you can start:

| **1) To the No on `Prop 8`_ People:**
|  Listen, your cause is fundamentally about the oppression of people.
You do your cause a grave injustice by being intolerant of those who
hold a different opinion. You should try to convince them, not disregard
them as stupid. Start with basics, like being afforded "life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness" and to actively oppress people is
inherently unAmerican. In fact this is exactly what the people who do
form an existential threat (ie the terrorists) do to their own. If they
bring up any sort of religious argument, you need only to bring up the
separation of church and state. Make them frame their arguments (and you
yours) solely on the basis of law and areligious morality. If they force
you into a religious argument, throw out that the Torah allows
lesbianism, and thus at least lesbians should be allowed to marry. But
if you allow lesbians but not gays then that is sexist... Rather than
hating on people next door/next city/next county you should do what Dan
Savage says and money to the No on 8 organization. And vote!

| **2) To the Yes on `Prop 8`_ People:**
|  This is probably a fundamentally intolerant viewpoint. I am not
saying you need to jump into writing homoerotic fan fiction. But what is
so wrong with people living different than you? Only half of those
people murdered in Germany's WWII death camps were Jewish, the other
half were a mish-mosh of Catholics, Gypsies, old and infirm, and a whole
lot of homosexuals. If you want to convince the other side that you are
right, you have an uphill battle. There may be an argument to be made
for civil unions. But I would think that this would fall under the
"Separate but Equal" category that got us so far before the civil rights
movement. Also, don't hate your friendly gay neighbor for their life of
sin, just donate money to your organization. And vote!

| **3) Atheists:**
|  This is a big category, so rather than having a lot of qualifiers and
explaining things for various types of unbelievers, **I am only talking
about fundamentalist, intolerant atheists**. Let's start with a song,
huh?

P.F. Sloan wrote in `Eve of Destruction`_: "*Hate your next door
neighbor but don't forget to say Grace.*\ "

You should \*not\* interpret this as there is no god(s), so I may hate
my neighbor freely. (Which I fear goes on a lot.) Rather you should
instead read this as reaffirming that your moral code comes from
something other than a divinely inspired place. And those 'religious'
folk don't seem to be any better people because of their beliefs.

Tolerance is irrespective one's beliefs. You can and should be accepting
of other peoples guaranteed right to believe whatever they want. This is
no reason to hate someone. If they are wise, then they won't hate you
for yours either.

Also, atheists, were do you get off re-appropriating the Bohr atom and
Darwin to your cause? You have to know that this doesn't help. Science
(and it symbols you are stealing) is more or less `reductionist`_. While
your belief is strictly founded on `holism`_. You can't point to
evolution and say "Thusly god doesn't exist." You are still presupposing
\*something\*. Darwin doesn't come into it. And if someone were to take
all of the universe in all time and point to it and say "This gigantic,
teeming differential equation is god." Even then should you disagree,
you would be assuming the same amount they are. How much stock someone
puts in the atom shouldn't be grounds for possibly killing them and
their descendants. Science is just a collection of models that sometimes
engineers build things with. It isn't your robot love slave.

And yes, I am intolerant of intolerance. But don't hate *me* for it.

And yes, I have a vested interest in promoting tolerance. Whenever
anyone anywhere is intolerant, my people somehow get the short end of
the stick. So if it helps, think of it like this. If you hate a group of
people for their beliefs, you are really hating the Jews. And remember
this time we "don't" have nukes. Klaatu barada nikto.

EDIT: I saw "Religulous" this weekend, and I feel I should add `these
people`_ to the list of cute, yet misused scientific symbols.
