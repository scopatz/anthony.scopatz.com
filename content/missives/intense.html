Sooo the SB crowd has started to find out about this journal. This will be
interesting. Brendan told me today that he had found it (because I
added him as a friend). He described it as "intense". I should have
said "Well, Brendan, it is because I am an intense guy! LOL!" I didn't
think of it at the time though ^_^. Instead I told him the truth, which
is that I use this as an outlet for my Vox which is not socially
acceptable.
