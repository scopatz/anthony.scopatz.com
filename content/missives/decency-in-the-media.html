Dan has instilled in me a real hatred for him. I am experiancing feeling I
have never experiance towards anyone else. This leads to compulsions
which would give a criminal record if carried out. Being the better
person is not wholly satisfying me with regards to Dan. I dislike him
so intensely because I percieved that he has betrayed me. I think this
is a general feeling amoung my friends but I will not claim that how I
percive events is what actually went down. Dante was a large influence
on my young psyche (with other classics as well). In Inferno, one may
recall that Satan appears as a large dog with three heads one each of
our national colors. In the Maw of each head is a different corpus
screaming in eternal Agony. They are Judas, Brutus and Cassius. Judas
is obvious and Brutus and Cassius of course betrayed Julius Ceaser. As
a Jew, the meaning behind this is largely allegorical, but the meaning
is important to me. Trust is the highest quality one can have in
another person. Renegging on that trust is the largest offence. Notice
how those in the worst damnation all committed crimes against their
fellow humans, while mere atheists were all chillin' over starbucks in
Limbo. Fuck Dan Stuart.<br><br>Syd confuses me. I love her. I think she
is a good person; in general. She did me no great betrayl like Dan.
However she did lie to me if not explicitly then by withholding
information through a semantic cop out. It will take time for me to
forgive her, but today she did apologize which goes a long way in my
book. I might even be able to let Dan back into my gaming group after
his dishonorable actions if he were to apologize on his own free
willrather than smugly thinking he has done no wrong while Janus-like
trying to prevent me from being hurt by the damage he has done. Still
sometimes Syd pisses me off since she is not wholly removed from guilt
in the matter. She is irrationally, incredibly stubborn. Once she takes
a stance on something she will not waver from it ever. She cannot even
be persuaded to think about other options once she has taken a stance.
Even if every other option has a better outcome for her she will not
think about it for weeks or months after the fact. She is Epimethius
Incarnate on some issues. It isn't just big emotionally charged issues
either, it can be small stupid things. This was the source of much
conflict in our relationship. If she was as grown up as I would expect
a hyper-analytic person to be in this manner we would not have had half
the problems we did. Not that we all don't go through simmilar things
ocassionally. However, recently all of those sorts of things in me I
was consiously using as a way to control my depression so as not to go
off the deep end while my family was in crisis. I even explained this
to Syd many times. Somehow I don't think she ever really accpeted that
for a time I had to be sad no matter what else was going on. Our
breakup is a perfect example of syd doing something that with some
thought could have been avoided and a better result for everyone would
have resulted. I think she just wanted us to have a better
relationship, and really who can blame a girl for that. Just don't go
with the first random solution. As much as I want to break Dan's
kneecaps, I think the pain of knowing he actually is incapable of real,
true friendship may be enough suffering for that maggot infested crap
pile. See, my first compulsion would have been bad for me ^_^<br><br>

Now,
Terrorism. Paul Krassner back in the sixties had "Fuck Communism"
Posters printed up and sold. They were offensive, but to whom? If
anyone dared to ask him to remove the sign, he would shout them down by
saying that they were soft on Communism. It worked on anyone, police
included. Most Decency-In-The-Media people were the same ones who used
anti-communism propoganda to create blacklists and the like. "Fuck
Communism" was a brilliant move. There is a story of some high school
student who for the graduation pictutre pulled out a "Fuck Communism"
poster at the last moment. Since the school could not simpily white out
the word Fuck -- leaving only Communism -- they whited out the whole
poster and there is a funny student holding a white sign in the final
version of this grad picture. Terrorism is the new Communism, so I
thought it worked. I hope to make a Fuck Terrorism poster and flash it
at Paul Krassner when I go to see him in June.
