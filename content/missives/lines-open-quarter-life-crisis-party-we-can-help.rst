The times are fast upon us. That is right people, my first in a series
of 25th birthdays is coming up! (I subcontract out City of Austin
Utilities to Tuck Everlasting Water Management.) But my birthday is on a
Tuesday this year. LAME.

Therefore, I have pegged off Friday August 21st for the Quarter Life
Crisis / ATX Homecoming / Back-to-School Party! However, I am out of
town and busy writing a paper right now. So I am taking suggestions.
What do you want to see done? The wackier, crazier, more nutso the idea,
well, you know me. The more likely it is to grab me. Have At!
