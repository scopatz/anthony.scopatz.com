And you just know he is gonna come hard.

I am so proud; my room mate *asked* for the second book in "Song of Ice
and Fire" \*before\* he had even finished the first one. Awesome.

At this rate he will likely finish the series before a certain someone
who goes by the pet name "Cersei"...

...and yes roomie, now you get this.

But yes, Winter has truly come here in the ATX. It is all rainy and
shit. Boo. grr. I can't abide precipitation that blocks the sun.
