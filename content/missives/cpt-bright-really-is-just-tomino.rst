Hot Damn! I finished Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ tonight. My heart was
skipping beats every minute. It. Was. Awesome.

But because they rarely do close-ups without space suits, I just noticed
something for the first time tonight. Glemy Toto, breeder of Elepeo Puru
and Puru Two, paramour of Roux Louka, and nemesis of Haman (though they
both fight for New Zeon/Axis), aside from his ridiculously blond hair,
also has purple eyes! I think this makes him Blood of the Dragon...

...and even though this is shamefully cross-genre, -medium, -style,
-generation it sadly still explains Everything.

SPACE TARGARYENS FTW!
