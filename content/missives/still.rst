I am still avoiding people except the logistics.

Probably will stay this way until after I get back from Switzerland
(Sept. 19th-20th?) depending on what is going on. This is about two
weeks longer than expected. But one of these is the conference; so
really you can blame Chocolate, Coo-Coo Clocks, and Secret Bank
Accounts.
