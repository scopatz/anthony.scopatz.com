I am super grumbley over this PhD proposal. SOOO Hellooo, LiveJournal!

I meet with my adviser again on Tuesday. Coincidentally, this is when a
series of Mobile Suits will save me. Mostly I was really looking forward
last week to not having to write a lick in this week. But no. Because of
suckage and revisions I will have to spend another half of a week
writing.

But even more than that, I want to be anywhere but here. It has rained
on my day off for the past two weeks. And of course the rest of the week
it is sunny and amazing. LAME. I could say that I don' know why Austin
became so negative and other places so positive, but that would be a
lie. Do you want to hear a poor, sad lie?

"*Then moon is made of cheese and I don't know why Austin became so
negative!*\ "

Still, there remains hope. I think that when I come back from the summer
the situation will be a lot better. Moreover, I fucking get to leave for
the summer! I am sorely tempted to start this a month early and just
leave now. I don't even have anywhere to go. Great! Even better. I have
a tent. And a bear barrel. Bring it. As cool as you are Austin, you are
city filled with people, who are sometimes lame.

Maybe I am altogether to sensitive to my surroundings. That would
explain a lot. It explains why I need positive individuals. Barring
that, the cold comfort of strangers is superior to any sort of
negativity. But even better than that is no one at all.

So meanwhile, in the intervening month, my bike is muddy and I am only
sated by mid-nineties slash. But tomorrow, or tomorrow tomorrow, or
tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow, I will be gone, fighting for peace. Get well
while I am away.

I know this is exactly the kind of post you hate.
