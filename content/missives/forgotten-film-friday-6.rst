Oh Candida! My home and native yeast infection! I just got four (4) more
injections. Hopefully this will kill of the last of my warts. I would be
most pleased. Other than that, my body is hatin' on me in new and
interesting ways. My stomach has been upset since the stupid elections,
but for the past day my ear has had some ridiculous ringing that won't
go away. Hrmmm...

Onto the movie!

**`Char's Counter-Attack (1988)`_:** The definitive end to the first
main Gundam continuity, this edition was beautifully animated. As the
name implies, it followed my second favorite character in the entire
Gundam Universe: Char Aznable. Much like the first series (MSG), Char is
portrayed as pure evil throughout much of the story. Only towards the
end is it relieved that Char isn't trying to destroy Earth per-say by
ramming a giant asteroid into it. He's just trying to usher in the next
ice age, which will force humanity to fully migrate to space, and thus
give the planet time to heal from all of the pollution and damage we
have done to it. The eco-terrorist in me was fighting my inner paladin
the whole time. Eco-terrorist wins. Faith in Char restored.

You can guess what `"Kill 'Em All" Tomino`_ does to both Char and Amuro
by the end. I was kinda glad. They both had survived for far too long.

Speculations on Mr Tomino's relationship problems and his
No-Character-Left-Standing nature abound. But I recently noticed
something beyond near every relationship failing, often times
tragically. Nearly all of the male newtypes end up on the "good-guys"
side while most of the female ones end up or are manufactured on the
"bad-guys" side. Furthermore, if it comes down to a male vs female
newtype battle, the women almost always die instead of the men (there
are notable exceptions). Maybe Tomino just hates on the ladies.

All in all, it was a very good movie. Some interesting stuff with people
training to be newtypes through spiritual awakening and via enhancement
surgery. Though I did struggle through all of the Char bashing. And
really I was just missing Sayla. Though Murai's appearances were very
very cool. Both Salya and Murai are sort of broken characters. If they
had been around Char would have failed miserably. And Bright didn't even
attempt to sleep with anyone other than Murai...tsk tsk. However he did
`slap`_ his OWN SON! Hawt damn!
