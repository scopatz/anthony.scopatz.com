So today I got nothing official but was very busy. There was a lot of
unofficial business accomplished, which was good, but I didn't get a
lick of programming done. I guess I studied for my final tomorrow.

In other news I am really liking Brian Ibbott's podcast "Coverville". It
is one my dad recommended to be and it is a lot of fun. Not all of them
are hits but it has a better record than most webcomics.

In actual news, I have started watching "Democracy Now" again. I forgot
how depressing it is and how awesome Amy Goodman is.

As it turns out, I need a couple of really good one or two word puns. If
you have any, please post them! Maybe you will win a prize if it is
\*really\* good.

Keep it real.
