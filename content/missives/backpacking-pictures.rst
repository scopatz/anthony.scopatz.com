Hello All,

I know it has been a while. But `here`_ are the pictures from my
backpacking extravaganza. The photos have captions and follow a story.

Or you can just watch the `slideshow`_ directly.

Either way, I hope to post about some of the things that cannot be
expressed by pictures about this trip before I leave Raleigh on
Wednesday.

And yes, I am now in North Carolina. I think the month I just spent in
California killed any hope for my budding southern accent... Ahh well...
