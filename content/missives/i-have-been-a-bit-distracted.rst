Sorry if I haven't posted in a while. Those of you who know what I
distracted by, know what I am distracted by. Otherwise, inquire within!

I spent the better part of the day doing some MAJOR cleaning of my
shower and tub. It is now all sparkleeeeee clean. If only I could get
the kinda ass that Mr. Clean has access to.

But this was all in preparation for my re-caulking of the tub and
replacing the soap dish. This is a long time in coming so I am pleased
by the progress. Furthermore, I am doing it myself whereas I thought I
was going to have to hire someone. Even Better!

Also in preparation for not being around exercise equipment this summer,
I have taken up running. So, YES. I am one of \*those\* people. You know
the ones you see in their little UT shorts and cotton T-shirt that
breathes heavily at crosswalks. I am not sure how I feel about my new
found status as I always silently giggled at my associates before I
picked up this habit.

To wrap this up, I will finish with the list of movies I have seen this
summer and how I would rate them, WITH A COMPLETE LACK OF JUSTIFICATION
(out of 100):

| **97** *Speed Racer
| **85** *Harold and Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay
| **83** *Read or Die*
| **80** *Iron Man
| **76** *Re-animator
| **66** *Hellboy*
| **64** *Indiana Jones*
| **38** *Prince Caspian*
