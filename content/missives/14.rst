This test measured you according to four criteria: Philosophy, Pride,
Involvement and Citizen Status.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

*Philosophy* reflects whether you agree with the philosophical
foundations of the United States, such as: liberty, equality, democracy
(though limited, not absolute), capitalism, checks and balances,
constitutionalism, etc.

*Pride* reflects your assessment of the factual reality and history of
the United States as a nation. It is your opinion as to whether the
United States has been a "good" country and whether it has acted rightly
or not.

*Involvement* reflects your level of political activism--whether you act
to stay informed of what is going on in the world, and what you do on
the basis of that information.

*Citizen Status* simply reflects whether you claimed to be a citizen of
the U.S. when asked by this test.

It is the opinion of this test that, of these four factors, the only one
that matters when it comes to being considered a Patriotic American is
one's score in the first category--Philosophy. Therefore, if you scored
between 0-33% in that category, you have been rated 'Unpatriotic';
34-66%, 'Somewhat Patriotic'; 67-100% 'Patriotic'.

Certainly, the other categories provide interesting information for your
(and others') consideration. However, they are not crucial for
Patriotism, and they do not necessarily reflect a love, or its lack, for
one's country. Regarding *American Pride*, some people will be surprised
that it does not affect the outcome of the test; some people will be
upset by this. However, if a person supports every military action the
United States has ever engaged in, but does not really support his
neighbors' right to live their lives in the ways that they see fit, then
they do not truly love the United States. Further, and despite much of
the rhetoric some political pundits engage in, a truly Patriotic
American can be highly critical of many of the actions undertaken by the
U.S. throughout history. Certainly, much of what the United States has
done has been done poorly or for the wrong reasons. And while the author
of this test believes that the United States has been mainly a force for
good in the world (and the most-free, best nation ever to exist), he
respects the opinions of those who would disagree with him and fully
supports their right to dissent. For that is what America is all about.

Regarding *Involvement*, it has been said that eternal vigilance is the
price of liberty. This is true, however it is also true that liberty
means that people can be as involved, or not involved, as they want.
Choosing not to vote, while perhaps unwise, is as much an exercise of
political liberty as anything else. Certainly, however, a low score in
involvement might mean that a person could stand to try to be more aware
of current events, or more actively involved in shaping them, because
sometimes they matter.

Regarding *Citizen Status*, I am certain that many people will believe
that to truly be a Patriotic American, one must be a citizen of the
United States. However, that is not so. One of the traits that sets the
U.S. apart from many other nations in history, is that it is a country
not organized specifically around a particular ethnicity, language,
religion, culture or common historical origin, but a shared political
ideology. The United States is organized around a common love of
liberty, individual rights and free expression. This, in part, accounts
for the unending stream of immigration starting from the very conception
of the nation and continuing on to the present day. In today's United
States, there are many thousands who are not citizens, and yet who live
in the United States and share its dreams (and many of them will be
citizens when they are able). The author would even argue that there are
many Patriotic Americans who have never yet even set foot on U.S. soil.
There are no requirements of language, skin color, religion, sexual
orientation or particular condition of any other personal detail to be a
"true American." Just a love of liberty.

I hope that the test was either entertaining, educational or some
combination of the two. I appreciate your taking it. If you have any
serious question/comment, the author is always glad to discuss this
subject or any other (though please keep in mind my initial
warnings--you knew what this test was about when you decided to take
it). Also, you might want to check out some of my other tests if you're
