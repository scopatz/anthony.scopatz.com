So I realize I haven't updated in a while. Or really been out of the
house.

**Surprise! Guess who had Swine Flu?!**

Well, at least now I am back in the swing of things. I no longer feel
like death. Right well in time for me to run off to California and
Wisconsin this month. Woo hoo...

The major event I more or less missed due to illness were High Holy Days
this year. I sort of book-ended them. I went to the first day of Rosh
Hashanah and the concluding services for Yom Kippur. I was not well
enough to fast, sadly.

But more than this, I didn't really get out apologies this year. I sent
out one email. To which I have yet to hear a response. Many of those
whom have received them in the past were not slated for them this year.
Which is good news. But a bunch of new people who didn't get them simply
won't. For better or worse, I have turned.

So if you felt like I owe you an apology, consider it granted. On the
other hand, if you feel like you have wronged me in the past, you are
now forgiven.

It seems a bit antiseptic to do it in this blanket fashion, but hey! I
was really fucking sick. And as my mom told me, Swine Flu isn't even
Kosher!
