So that was certainly aimed at the not-quite-modern cross section
literature.  There are many and varied other categories of books, to my
mind that would be much better suited especially if you are going to
muck up such a collection of incoherent works as this.  I am personally
involved in reading the works of John Muir and have found them to be
much more satisfying than all save three of the ones that I had read. 
Furthermore they didn't include any of the books out there that I had
read and ultimately loathed that were not written by Dickens.  They
listed all of the Harry Potter books individually and all of the Lord of
the Rings books.  Substance!  For Me!
