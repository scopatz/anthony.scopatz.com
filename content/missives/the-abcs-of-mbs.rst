So in case you didn't know, my \*real\* Myers-Briggs typography is XNXJ.
The first X denotes that I am neutral on the Introvert-Extrovert fronts.
The second X denotes a simultaneous Thinking-Feeling front.

Most of the time (depending on friend group) I affect a ENTJ type. This
is because this is the most advantageous type to have in dealings with
other. People tend to trust extroverts (usually wrongly) more initially.
Furthermore, "Thinking" people tend to get the more academic and
scientific and higher paying jobs than those "Feeling" types.

However, there are those times, where for whatever reason, I affect a
different personality type. Certainly around my cousins I am an INTJ. I
am an XNFJ with my parents.

Yet, people have always seemed to notice and possibly get concerned when
I switch personality types while they watch on. Especially when I make
the full flip and go to INFJ. I understand your response to this, but it
is nothing to be worried about. I am not sad, just different.

To help you on your way, when I am in this other, fully natural mode of
expression and feeling, I just want to be treated kindly. I strive for
communication and understanding. I am a little lonely right now, but
that is because Trevor left me.

In summary, I don't want people to understand me, I just want them to
accept me for who I am. Me and my fluctuating Id.
