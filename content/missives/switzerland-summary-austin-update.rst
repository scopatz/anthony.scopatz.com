I'll try to keep this short and snappy, but I have the feeling it will
run away on me.

| After my last update I headed to Zurich and did a walking tour of the
town. The points of interest are as follows:
|  **1) Grossmuenster Church:** This was the church that the eminent
`Zwingli`_ presided in. If I had to pick a Christian hero, tops would
certainly be Joan of Arc. But a \*very\* close second would be Zwingli.
His teachings were very much in Jewish Rationalist tradition (eg Rambam,
Spinoza), if not intentionally. Also, rad statue of Charlemagne (likely
my 3rd Christian hero) in the crypts.
|  **2) Fraumuenster Church:** Former abbey that has a a ton of
beautiful stained class windows done by `Marc Chagall`_. You know, the
nice Jewish painter...
|  **3) Zurich Synagogue:** I found it, but it was locked and I couldn't
go inside. Looked to be more of a Sephardic construction, which
interested me. Also, the iron work on the outside was a repeating
pattern of pentagons-inscribed-within-pentagrams. Where's the Mogen
David, WTF? Kissed the mezuzah and left.
|  **4) Rietberg Museum:** Zurich has 50 odd museums so I had to be a
little choosy. So I went for the one that was only a moderate hike
though a park (I kid you not) called the Arboretum. The museum featured
mostly Ancient Asian works, with a smattering of works by indigenous
populations of Africa, Pacific Islanders, and the Americas (including
Inuits!). They had a really good selection of Japanese wood cut prints,
which is something I am very into. I love the idea of inventing a method
for cheap, mass-produced artwork and then immediately using it for porn.
The best quote off of one of these was "*Going home or living abroad are
the same thing*\ ". However, their rotating section was even cooler. It
was an illustrated (using old paintings from the 16-1700s) walk-through
of the `Ramayana`_. This of course being one of the oft-overlooked
highly influential pieces of ancient mythology. One of the better museum
exhibits I have ever seen.

In summary, I may have been a bit harsh on Switzerland before. It just
took me a few days to adjust. The real proof to this was that my last
night there was of course the night that I started dreaming in German
again. (Not that my dreams weren't still nightmares, but eh, you can't
win em all.)

Zurich is a really neat. I would totally go back. I am even toying with
the idea of applying to `CERN`_ or `PSI`_ post-grad-school, assuming I
pass my quals. You know, get out of the country for a while and as an
alternative to Los Alamos or some Academic thing here. There are a
number of Asian institutes that are very good as well, but I can at
least pretend to know the language in Switzerland. Also, they have the
benefit of not being in the EU, which I can talk more about later.

And on one final note: whoever moved my table and couch while I was
away, please refrain from \*ever\* doing this again. I know it was only
by a couple of inches. However, I navigate around my place with the
lights off at night. I rely heavily on my mental map to do this, so...
