0 -- Last Saturday I was up in Three Rivers (3R) with everyone. That
morning I needed some supplies so I went out to Village Market. I needed
some Pop Tarts for breakfast. They also amazingly had butterscotch
schnapps, so I picked some up. (I knew people had brought Baileys and/or
Emmets; Buttery Nipples were "emme"-nant.) Then, my stomach was feeling
bad so I got some Mylanta. Right above the Mylanta were the condoms.
Thinking it would be funny I picked these up too. Hence, I walked up to
the counter laid down my Pop Tarts, my booze, my Mylanta, and my
condoms, shrugged, smiled, and said "It is just one of those days ^\_~."

1 -- So I have had these weird growths on my hands for a while now. I
self-diagnosed them as common warts. But I tried freezing them off
multiple times. When this didn't work, I thought they weren't. Thus I
went to the dermatologist the other day. \ ***She gave me a yeast
infection.***\  No joke! She actually injected the aforementioned areas
with yeast infection protein. It turns out they are warts. The yeast
infection protein tricks your body into attacking the area. While there,
your immune system finds the warts and then tries to destroy them too.
Very sneaky. \ ***She gave me a yeast infection Three (3) TIMES!***\ 

2 -- I am watching this TV series that I am renting the discs from
Netflix. I finished disc 5 and because of some haranguing I had all of
my discs in at once. But for whatever reason, they decided to send me
disc 6 from Butte, MO. However, they sent me discs 7 & 8 from like 60
miles away. Now they all left the same day which means I am sitting here
debating whether to skip a disc or not. But this all begs the question,
"WHY DOES NETFLIX HAVE A DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN BUTTE, MO?" Nothing is
close to Butte but Butte. This can't be economical....

3 -- It was Sicily, 1922: `Estelle Getty died`_. Good Night, Sweet
Prince(ss?)

4 -- I like getting in discussions on LJ.  Some people named Kerry are
feeling compelled to comment and are =).  Some people named Kerry are
feeling compelled to comment and aren't =(.  Some people named Kari
aren't even reading =\\.  In conclusion, teletubbies.
