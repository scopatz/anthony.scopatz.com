Why do I have to have roommate troubles durring High Holy days? I
suppose it is to teach me to adapt a passive agressive strategy.

All I really want is a drink of water and to be left alone. Is this
really so hard for the world to grasp.

I just had a neighbor ask me if I wanna smoke a bowl. I am sure this is
a product of Josh and Eliot. If I ever catch them they are soooo out. I
don't think they realize that yet.
