This should be taken purely from a mathematical standpoint as I have
personally no experiance with any more than 1 other at a time.

The problem, simply stated, is "Assuming that one's brain can only
comprehend up to 7 different signals at a time, what is the optimum
number of partners in the bedroom?"

For example, say you had a 5-on-1 senario with five partners primarily
focused on one other partner. Let us limit every partner partner to
having 6 body parts with which they can contact meaninfully the one
partner: their loins, two hands, two legs/feet, and their mouth. While
where on the One they touch may matter for pleasure's sake and for
geometry (not two body parts may touch the same part of the subject [an
exclusion principle]), the subject may only recive a maximum of seven
signals so clerarly one partner is not enough but two is too many. The
5-on-1 is a complete waste, mathematiclly (psycologically it is likely a
home run!).

To return to the original problem, let us now try to satisfy or at least
excite everyone. This is an 0-on-x senario where x is an element of the
natural numbers. Everyone has 6 signals to give and seven with which to
recieve. For normal 0-on-2 sex (where there are 2 people who both want
to be fully satisfied), both parnters are unsatisfied, by one signal for
a total of two unfufilled signals. If you add one to x, then you also
add another 6 signals and 7 slots. Therefore the total number of
unfufilled signas is increased by one. By Induction, 0-on-x sex is
always unsatisfying. Everyone cannot always be happy.

The hunt continues. Restating the problem, find x and y elements of the
natural numbers such that y-on-x minimizes the number of unfufilled
slots. The problem, of course, gets more interesting when you allow the
number of slots and signals to varry. Sadly, that is beyond the scope of
this post.

All I know is that I am now wishing I had stayed in my group theory
class.

The things I think of in the tub.
