So Yesterday when I woke up I was Graduating but not doing comencement.  
Today I am now doing comencement but not graduating.  <br><br>Stupid System; 
Stupid Man.<br><br>I
have two blocks on my graduation. The first is that I need to petition
for the physics department to accept 8 units of Upper division Math for
the physics elecive courses. No biggie really (I think) as they already
said they would. The other is this really dumb thing where we have this
writing requirement which means that we have to take 6 classes off of a
dumb list which count as writing classes. I made the mistake of
believing that the classes I took from the Writing Department would
count towards this. Nope. I only have 5 of the six classes. LAAAAME! So
now I have to petion for some of my Physics lab classes, which have had
an extensive amount of writing in them, to count for this. Almost all
of them work except for this fuzzy 25% of the grade clause. In any
event I am hoping that saying hey I have grad school to go to and so
summer is not an option and at least one of these three classes totally
satisfies your needs and hey NO class in my major is on you stupid list
will have them count one of the classes for me. <br><br>If this doesn't happen then 
I am basiclly screwed.  I just wanna get outta here on time...is that so much to ask?
