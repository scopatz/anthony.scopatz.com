I am rebuilding tables.

Seekatz and I have been playing Warcraft 3.

I am liking being single because it gives me the opportunity to rebuild
tables.

I have been missing people close to me, whether they be near or far.

Rebuilding tables affords me too much time to think.

Thinking is bad, unless it is about a better way to rebuild tables.

Soon, I will be a scientist.
