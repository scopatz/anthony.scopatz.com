So as some of you may or may not know I had my first colonoscopy EVER
yesterday. And let me just say it was a load of fun. I actually did feel
much better after the procedure oddly enough. In any event, here were
some of the choice words that I said under sedation via Anthony's
retelling.

| --Me: "Hey, did you guys video tape the procedure?"
|  Nurse: "No."
|  Me: "That is a shame. I could have put it on YouTube or something."

--"Today is gonna be awesome. I should have one of these every morning;
I don't have to do any work today."

--Apparently I needed to drink something afterwards I so they gave me a
juice selection and I choose apple. They brought it to me in a can which
I stared at for a while before before drinking. After consuming it and
setting it down I said something like, "Why did I get apple juice, I
HATE apple juice.

--I told the nurse all about how I wanted to be a computational
physicist.

--When Anthony first walked in he asked me how I was. I said, "Oh man I
am so relaxed. I feel like I could go into my parents basement and smoke
weed and listen to Pink Floyd."

If I find out about any others I'll let you know but I think that was
all of the good ones. All in all, yesterday was by far the most pleasant
day I have had since coming to Austin.
