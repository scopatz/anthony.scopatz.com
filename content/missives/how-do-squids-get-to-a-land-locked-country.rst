I have successfully made it to Switzerland and to the congress. The trip
out here was naturally not without its hiccups. I was about as depressed
as ever when I first got here. Here are the reasons for it that I can
tell,

1. The travel over here had us arrive in town before noon local time.
   I then had to stay up until around 8 pm to get onto a normal schedule.
   The 40+ hours of being awake does things to a man.
2. No Gundam access for a *whole* week! Just the thought has had me
   in pangs. You know you are an addict when...
3. Not to diminish what is going on back home in Texas, but the
   weather here has been awful. We got here on the first day of snow for
   this season. Another data point proving I might have `SAD`_.
4. The ethnic homogeneity of Switzerland.
5. Short hair on women.
6. My eyes are blue.

You may have noticed that Disgaea was not on the above list. This is
because I have been fervently playing my PSP copy, which has sustained
me through many afternoons of darkness.

Otherwise, the above reasons combine in interesting ways. Firstly, being
extremely tired and stressed out triggered my ever-present stomach
problems with always leaves me emotionally battered. Then on the train
from Zurich to Interlaken, I started thinking...which is always a bad
idea.

I noticed that on trains we were passing that the we were passing that
the 90+% of the people fit into one of the four ethnic Swiss groups,
which are all more or less white. Up to this point and afterward,
whenever Erich and I would go anywhere we would try to speak in German.
With Dr. Schneider, whose Deutsch is better than mine, others would
reply in German. Even though I always started in German, they never
failed to reply in English.

This got me thinking. Both of our families left the old country at about
the same time. But Erich still looks Ethnically German (and thus
ethnically Swiss for the part of Switzerland we are in). I do not. I no
longer look like a native in part because my people were wiped out of
this region 60 years ago. Sure the Swiss weren't part of the Nazi
regime, but they were just a smidge more than complacent in it. I don't
know if other people have ever had this experience, but I felt very
uneasy for a while after I arrived. Not in a personal safety kind of
way, but I felt this overwhelming rejection of just everything. I was
ashamed I had ever even tried to learn German.

Shake and bake this with Gundam and you get more reasons why Char is my
hero. Would you have joined the Axis military force in order to get
close to Hitler and kill him? Probably.

On another note, short hair on women is still classy in Europe. None of
them are making any kind of statement and they can't \*all\* be dykes.
Of die Frauen at the conference, I have only seen one woman with hair
below shoulder length. Only 40% have hair at or near shoulder length and
all the rest are even closer trimmed. Normally, one would think that
this would please me. Instead it made me question why I wasn't living
here (see above) and the ghola ratio is too high. Not that I wouldn't
tap 25% of them in a second. But I haven't. Yet.

All of this has gotten me shook up enough for my eyes to have
transmigrated to blue. And for them to stay there. I tried to take a
picture, but shining a light in my eyes threw off the color balance and
they ended up looking green-gray in the picture anyways.

High Holy Days are coming up. And you know what that means.
