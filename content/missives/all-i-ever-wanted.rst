In Three Rivers.

Things could be going better but they really ain't that bad.

We went on the very pretty Ladybug trail yesterday and saw not a single
one.

I wish I could write more but my time at this internet cafe is about to
run out. So I'll leave you with this.

At a Pharmacy in I bought a rubber ducky for my little cousin J.P. (John
Paul). The likeness of this aquatic toy was of the late, great Pope John
Paul II. It was a big hit.
