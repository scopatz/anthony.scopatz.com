While rereading some of my old posts recently, I was reminded of `the Good 'Ole OK Cupid - Walker Project`_. For the newer readers, I have a
series of fake, passive OKC profiles where I let people message me.
Humor follows. Check out the link.

So here is an update of the latest batch of hilarious messages that
people have sent Jessica (bi/f) and Mark (gay/m).

| -------------------------------------------
|  **#1 to Jessica:**
|  *tucson and austin are very much alike cities. i <3 tucson.*

| **#2 to Jessica:**
|  I LARP, still do from time to time. Is that too dorky for you?

Your profile didn't really say, so I am wondering what you are looking
for right now?

| **#3 to Jessica:**
|  *hi
 nice pic
 of you laying down
 too bad I can't see your face
 whats your name
 ?*

| **#4 to Mark:**
|  *ha. That pic of you two in black with cowboy hats -- looks like y'all are Siamese twins. Oh well. A man can dream*

| **#5 to Mark:**
|  *i spotted a bear flag and I agree with everyone else's reaction on that adorable mustache. What's up? Hugs*

| **#6 to Mark:**
|  *This Jesse, and I'm deaf mean I cant hear and speaking...SO What do u like 2 with me? You;re so sexy, i just check your picture so sexy and cute! winks!*

| **#7 to Mark:**
|  *hey sexy so what's up with you? do u want to have alittle fun... yeah, i know my profile says straight but i still like to have fun with guys... i just keep it low key! :P*

| **#8 to Mark:**
|  Hi I read your profile and I like what is there. I am new to Texas and I love it here so far. I love to dance and not very good at it, but do it for fun. I would like to find someone to have fun with. You look like that person. I am not that good looking, but am losing weight. check out my profile and let me know what you think.

| I am interested in getting to know more about you sexy thing you. I hope that we can get to know more about each other and see where things end up.
|  **Then, Three Months Later**
|  *Love your profile and pics. You are soo sexy. Wanna chat?*
|  -------------------------------------------

And once again the litmus test of my life reveals that only gay men
covet my assets.

**So favorites, everyone? Post a comment telling the world which one you
like the most! Mine is either #3 or #7.**
