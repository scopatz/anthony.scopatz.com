There is just something about the Bay Area that no longer feels like
home. But that makes visiting friends and family here all the more
intense! It is no longer a place I can always come back to and so it
really \*is\* a special occurrence.

So to the AustinKnights and others, Texas is home. Certainly after
Raleigh, and maybe after Idaho, I feel that this has been true. Maybe
home is more than where I hang my copious collection of hats. But even
though I may have taken the fedora with me, I'll be back for the others!

God, I love traveling! And vacations!
