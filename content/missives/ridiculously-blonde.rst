I did this a couple of weeks ago, while avoiding real work. But since
then, I have been too busy with real work to actually post this.

As a GNU/Linux user and computational scientist, I spend *a lot* of time
looking at computer screens. So a while ago I decided to do the
transparent terminal thing, so I could see my background while I code.
Keep things spicy rather than looking at white-on-black ALL of the time.

Most people (sub-human kernel hackers, really) choose their backgrounds
as either softcore porn, or softcore hentai if they are \*really\*
nerdy. However these pictures tend to be flashy and interfere with you
being actually able to read the text. So these people (see above) have
to actually decrease the overall transparency.

I go with simple, mostly black backgrounds. And I require that the color
scheme in the picture \*does not\* interfere with the default terminal
color scheme (Yeah Gentoo!).

This more or less means that I have to make my own backgrounds since it
is impossible to find pre-generated images that satisfy my needs. I
still go with the traditional anime theme, though not quite as slutty.

My previous background from last year was for GTO. `My new background is
of a new type of hero.`_
