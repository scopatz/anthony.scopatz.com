So If you couldn't tell, I was rather disgruntled on Friday. Only after
my last post did I admit to myself that I was actually sick. My inner
ear had been all messed up and I was inflamed underneath my jaw. I
basiclly went home as soon as I could and passe dout for four hours. I
took yesterday off and just played WoW all day. I know, pitiful. I was
about to go out many time but I was really calling that one in.
Conseqeuntlly, I felt much better today.

Today however, I have just returned from my 12 hour extravaganda into
the world. First I went to Costco and bought some shelving so I can
finally stop living out of boxes for once in my life. Tomorrow I get to
unpack, Yeah!! It is the little things ya know. Then I went to Thor's
Hammer. If you are having trouble, this is one of the local gaming
store. There is an open to the public D&D game here. We ran through the
first part of converted 2nd Ed mod. Very fun. Afterwords, Je (pronounced
Jay)(from the game) and I went to a pub downtown to watch a free showing
of "V for Vendetta". Suprisingly poingent. I must say I really liked it
a whole lot. I almost feel bad for saying this beacsue it was such a
philisophical film (Aesthetics is Philosophy, Ha!) but Natalie Portman
with no hair is Hot. Hott I daresay. Hawt! Ok enough of that. A lot of
interesting moral dilemas with no right answers and a ton of char.
development. The Wisochi Bros. may be redeemed yet. It also was funny
that the main villan looked a lot like Syd's dad. Je and I spent the
next couple hours walking around downtow. Had a couple beers. Good
times. I didnot intend on being out all night but hey, who can deny a
fun time.
