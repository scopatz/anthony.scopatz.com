Movies are hard to watch. Is there no joy left in my heart? (<--Not a
Rhetorical Question, just tough to answer due to double negative
issues.)

It is amazing to me how perceptive some people can be when they are
supposedly intent on other things. This convinces me of their P-nature
over their J. Certainly not the X of some people's memory. Also in
broaching the issue was very F like, which I believe was decided
earlier. For a sum total of EN(?)FP.

Eventually, I will think up a way to end this post.
