So my brain just gave out and thus I have decided to make a little post
on this Technology thing.

Lately I have been into listening to a variety of extremely simple and
cheesy dance songs by the Europop group E-Rotic. Most of their music is
delightfully hedonistic to listen to. They have their style and they
totally run with it, no holes barred. Most of which consist of the
standard techno elements but with slightly less repetition. They sing
almost exclusively about sex with heavy overtones of the female
vocalist's moans. I don't think, and so I have read, that they are
native English speakers. Most of their lines are quite short and contain
a lot of rhyme and syllable matching. For example: "Max don't have sex
with your ex, it will make your life complex." Somehow this endears them
to me all the more.

I think I have also mentioned before newfound appreciation for Blondie.
Normally repeating one's self is a sign to stop...but not I.

I have started eating bulk trail mix that I mix myself from the store.
Sometimes I worry about myself. Often. Now I know I am repeating myself.

So yeah, not much is really going on as I spent nearly the entire
weekend at home doing work. I am looking forward to the White Ghost
Shivers 1920's concert on Friday. It should be fun. I hope I can
convince someone to come with me. I hate going to that stuff by myself.
Also, I have all this 20's aesthetic that is trying to desperately to
get out and I have been neglecting it. The Alamo Drafthouse was showing
Battleship Potempkin last Saturday and I failed to leave because I was
writing a paper.

In not totally unrelated news, I have resigned (happily!) to not having
much "free" time in the near future in order to do this project that I
am on right and do it quickly.

I worry that I am no longer sending out the right pheromones. Charles
Mingus was a motherfucker.
