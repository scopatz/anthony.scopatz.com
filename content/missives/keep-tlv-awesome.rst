Keep Tel Aviv Awesome

Picture it, Tel Aviv, 2014.  What an awesome trip!  I had the pleasure of visiting
my brother Shane at his home in Tel Aviv for the past month.  Shane is currently 
a dancer in the `Batsheva ensemble <http://www.batsheva.co.il/en/>`_.  This makes
him famous - at least in Isreal and insofar as everyone knows Batsheva.

**I had a fantastic time!**

I had been holding off on going to Israel for a long time.  I had my misgivings,
I had never been before, I didn't go on Birthright, and I don't particularly enjoy
touristy activities. There are things in Israel I had always wanted to see - the 
Heights, the Negev, Tel Aviv - but I knew that most tourists miss out on these gems
in favor of other outings - Jeruselum, the Dead Sea, Masada.  Luckily with my 
brother, we were able to skip out on all of the stuff I did not want to do and we 
were able to have a more tailored experiance.  This was exactly want I wanted.

Since both Shane and I were working the whole time, the weeks were structured 
such that we would work Sunday through Thursday.  Friday morning we would leave for
somewhere fun and return Saturday night. 

There is something truly beautiful about this schedule. It places shabbat dinner 
right at the center of importance. Since people generally have Friday off of work (or
as a half-day) this gives everyone time to prepare to spend an evening with friends &
family - even if they are secular!  Saturday durring the day is quite relaxed giving 
one time to recover from the previous night's feast. Then just as you start to get 
antsy the world comes alive again on Saturday night. This feels so much more right
than the diaurnal sabbath tradition in the West.  In the U.S., I am often annoyed 
when a city isn't awake until 11 pm everyday.  In Israel, I barely noticed that 
almost everything was closed for a day and a half every week.

My Other Homeland
=================
There is a cunning similarity between Israel and the best country in the Union: Texas.
The comparison clearest along ecological, geological, and cultural axes. And what
Austin is to Texas, Tel Aviv is most certainly to Israel. Needless to say, I felt very 
at home.

Israel is neatly divided into swampish hill country in the north and the desert
in the south.  Sound familiar?  On my first weekend, we traveled to the north and 
stayed with Shane's friend and fellow Batsheva dancer Ayelet's family.  They live in 
tiny vilage about 3 km from the border with Lebanon.  The terrain here was hilly 
with peaks between 100 - 300 m and the floara was mostly low-lying oaken forrest. 
On Saturday morning we went for a beautiful hike down one of the canyons.  The 
resemblance to Lost Maples or Pedernales is uncanny.  A beauty matched is no less 
beautiful.

Geologically, Israel is also similar to Texas in certain ways.  They both were
under the ocean for a very long time. The earth in these places has the same tenor:
gradually slopping hillsides, sandstone, and fosils coming from pushed up sediment.
This landscape gives rise to some of the most vibrant sunsets I have ever seen.

The is very little light pollution in this area due to Mediterranean not being so 
far away (in absolute terms) and the aridness of the region.  Figure 4 was taken 
in Mitzpe Ramon on my second full weekend there.  We stayed at a place called 
`Silent Arrow <http://www.hostels-israel.com/hostels/silent-arrow-desert-lodge/>`_, 
which is a tent and hut hostel-ish place that is holistic without being hokey.
If anything, it reminded me of a permenant version of a burn event camp.  What
is not to like?  I *highly* recommend this place.

For our hike that weekend, we went down into the `Makhtesh Ramon <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhtesh_Ramon>`_. 
This is incredible.  There are no words in English to describe it.  Seriously.  The 
word 'makhtesh' doesn't have an English equivalent.  It can be loosely translated as
'crater' but that isn't quite right because it was not formed by a metor impact. 
Texas in all its vastness does not have anything quite like this.

Culturally - from what I can infer - Israelis are about as home proud as Texans. My 
main metric for this is the number of state flags per capita that you see in public.
Do car lots need flags wagging out in their wares? Does every other hook on every wall
need a banner (as if you could forget where you were)? Is a lone star enough to 
symbolize your communal greatness?  Yes, yes, yes!

I think the propensity for showing the standard is one of the most misunderstood 
and misinterpreted things about Texas. It shows a gladness in the identity. 
I don't think that it is arrogancnce as it is often thought to be (especially by 
outsiders).  You don't need to think that you are better than others to be happy 
in who you are and happy to show it.  Pollitics aside, one of the things that makes 
Texas great is that Texans are generally happy to be Texans.  I can't say the same
about California, where cultrally they *do* think that they are better than others
while simeletanously only very few people are particularly proud to be Calfornian.
Israel falls well on the Texas side. I think that there is a lot of value in being
home proud.

In case you think that it is unfair to put pollitics aside here, it 
is important to note that every place has its own deep, unresolved issues. Texas, 
California, and Israel all live in seemingly infintie and inextrable quagmires.  
Through these divisions, some places still manage to be happy with themselves.
I am not going to get into the business of comparing human suffering in this post.
However, I bet that if we were to compare attrocities committed by these three states
Israel would come out with the cleanest record - not that this justifies it in anyway!
This is simply to state that the U.S.A. does not have moral superiority and any belief
to that effect is historically false.
