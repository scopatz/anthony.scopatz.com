You may recall that a few months ago I wrote <a href="http://inscight.org/2012/03/09/binary-in-a-coalmine/">a post</a> about how open source is a continuum and that free and open are orthogonal concepts.  Well, the nice people at the American Nuclear Society invited me to a round table discussion on software licences on Monday where I presented this material.  I figured I'd <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/inscight/pres/scopatz_ans-annual2012_roundtable.pdf">post my slides here</a> in case you are interested.  Enjoy!
