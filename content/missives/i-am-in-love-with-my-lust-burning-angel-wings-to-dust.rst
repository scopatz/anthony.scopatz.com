So a black man walking along the beach found a lamp in the sand. He
picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a Jewish genie. The genie
said, "I'll grant you two wishes. Anything you desire."

| The black gentleman thought about this for a while and then said, "First, I wish to be white. And secondly I wish to be next to some warm, wet pussy." So the genie turned him into a tampon.

I don't know if any one else has ever noticed this, but I have. In
Austin, walking around campus, I ofen see hot, hawt, or good-looking
guys going with gals that are not quite as attractive (in my skewed
book).

Oddly, this natural order of things seems to be reversed here in Idaho
Falls. I more often than not have seen the more attractive member of a
couple be the female.

This is all working up to this couple I saw yesterday which was by far
the most dichotomous I have had the chance to observe along these lines.
The female looked to be healthy and well proportioned. Thin, but not
unnaturally so. Tall-ish and well developed. The male was a 5'9" - 5'10"
sasquatch who weighed 200-225 lbs. None of this mass appeared to be
mussle. If there is such a thing as a beer belly, he was packing a
kegger. The female was absolutely hanging on her partner like a gibbon
at an Ape 'abitat.

If put seperately one would not place these two on the same level, or
even prime material plane.

(Interjection: I am sitting here at Villa Cafe, my home I'd rather live
in, and there is this strange middle aged couple that keeps staring at
me. I stare back and they turn away momentarily.)

In other news, Nightwish is touring again!

Even better than this they are going to San Antonio in November. I am
going. Furthermore someone is going with me, beacuse going to concerts
alone is lame. Ya'll can volunteer now or draw straws as the sacrifice
or whatever. There must be one who will partake with me or be
unwillingly victimized otherwise. If persecution is the only option, I
will of course pay for the ticket. I'd rather it not come to that
though....

I have been invited to float the Snake River on Tuesday with some
coworkers. I am not sure I am going to go. I think it is up to how I
(read my stomach) feels that day. I haven't tried my swimsuit on in
years. Ok a little more than a year but still.

I am slightly less pregnant today. My doctor took me off of the
probiotic (which didn't really work) and has instead put me on an
antibiotic.

The thinking I guess is that there was some good bacteria that wasn't
populous enough and that is why I was all bloated. However since this
doesn't appear to be the case, there may in fact be too much of a bad
bacteria so now we must kill it.

Lets hope this works!
