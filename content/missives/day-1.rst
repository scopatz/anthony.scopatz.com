I am now east of the Mississippi, and there is not much of the river
left to sell me down.

I have made it to Baton Rouge. It took me a mere four hours to back and
leave. This is duly impressive since I am going to be gone for ~3
months.

I miss Austin. I miss Texas.

My hotel is pretty swanky, though.
