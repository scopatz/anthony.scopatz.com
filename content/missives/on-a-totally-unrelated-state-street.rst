So I realize that an *Avenue Q* and *Fiddler on the Roof* mashup might
have limited appeal, but here it is nonetheless.

**On a totally unrelated note,** I finally got my pair of `Vibram Five
Fingers KSO!`_ Naturally, my feet are too small and I am forced to buy
the women's...

**On a totally unrelated note,** I went to the Book Den and found and
purchased "*`Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk`_*\ ", *circa*
1914. 'Primitive Folk' has a fairly obvious meaning. 'Intermediate
Types', however, is early 20th century parlance for transvestites,
transsexuals, hermaphrodites, and anyone else who doesn't fit into the
gender binary. Now mind you, criticisms abound. But this book is
h.a.w.t. HOT!

**On a totally unrelated note,** I went to the Book Den and found and
purchased a 1907 partially-illustrated copy of the Nibelungenlied. Or
for those unfamiliar with German epic, the mythological retelling upon
which Wagner based his famous Ring cycle.

**On a totally unrelated note,** my father got back from a business trip
to Japan today and brought me a Gundam action figure! Thanks Pops!

**On a totally unrelated note,** for broader appeal, Weird Al has
released his best music video in years: a Doors-esque cometary on
Craigslist.
