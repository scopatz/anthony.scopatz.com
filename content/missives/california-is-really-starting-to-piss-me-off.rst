In case you didn't already know, `Hans Reiser has been convicted of one
count of murder in the first degree.`_

In case you don't know who Hans Reiser is, `you should go here`_.

And this is why you should care. California recently has been involved
in too many high profile court cases which the state justice system has
completely botched. First and foremost of these on my mind is `Stanley
Tookie Williams`_. Hans Reiser is another.

The Free and Open Source Software community has long been one of
skeptics and conspiracy theorists. Furthermore, it's more prominent
members often suffer from hubris and tend to get in public cat fights
with one another. Major and successful code project are like as not to
be started because rather than branching an existing code and making it
do what YOU need it to (which is what the whole experiment is all
about), programmers are just dicks to each other and think that they can
do it better all by their lonesome. Hans Reiser was certainly not free
from this.

However, in the case of Nina Reiser things simply not add up and it
doesn't take a paranoid schizophrenic (or your standard Open Source
Fan-Boy-Girl [Now with Both Genders! Didn't you get the patch?]) to see
that.

Now I am not saying Hans is innocent because I \*love\* his file system.
I am saying that if I were a juror, I would not be able to in good
conscience say that he committed premeditated murder beyond all
reasonable doubt!

The fact that there is no body, Nina was having an affair with someone
who claims to have committed 8 previous murders (which they didn't allow
in court), and that all evidence presented was circumstantial leaves a
lot of wiggle room when condemning a fellow human being.

Much of the evidence against him is damning I'll agree, but then there
is `this asshole`_. The jurors themselves don't even have a good guess
as to how the murder that they are sentencing him for took place!

But what really makes me feel for him (innocent or otherwise) is when he
said this,

"I just keep thinking that I'm stuck in George Orwell's 1984. The
government has taken away my kids, invaded my house, held me in solitary
confinement and caused me all sorts of financial problems."

If you have ever had any sort of run in with the law, even a minor one,
and tried to contest it, then you know exactly what this man is going
through. (It should be noted here that I feel the most for the kids
since the state of California has now taken them away from their parents
multiple time in two years).

Now, since the community is as described above, you will hear a lot of
crazy stories. None of them are true! (Most likely). Nina probably did
not run away from her kids back to Russia, framing her husband. It was
not Microsoft that killed Nina to frame Hans. It wasn't the Russian
Mafia. I am sure their are other ones, but don't believe any of them.

But just to prove that their is no justice in this world and not just in
California, I will refer you to `this mans case`_. He abducted his OWN
daughter when she was 11 and held her captive in a 100 sq ft room for 24
GAWDDAMNED years and repeatedly raped her, siring 7 of his own
children/grand-children, one of whom (of course) died. And he admits it!

And you know what his maximum sentence is? 15 years because it is
\*only\* rape and it is Austria. I am sorry when you you enslave
someone, you should be imprisoned for at least as long as you held them
sans any other crimes against humanity.

It occurs to me now that California may be having all of these problems
because they have an Austrian for governor.
