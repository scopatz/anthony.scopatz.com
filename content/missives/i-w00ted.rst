I could write about the election yesterday, or I could write about
w00tstock 2.9...

Fine, this is sort of a serious kind of middle of the road sort of
interactive web log-ish thing.  I'll do the pundit dance for you.

Basically, the election was a complete disaster...or was it?!  While not
a sympathizer, I am a Tea Party empathizer.  Even the most liberal of
publications, `the Economist`_, feels some amount of kinship:

    ...in how many other countries would a powerful populist movement
    demand less of government, rather than endlessly and expensively
    more?

There are legitimate problems in this country and people are genuinely
upset at the dysfunctional incumbent government.  At its heart, the Tea
Party is an anti-establishment movement.  Unfortunately for the rest of
us, their platform falls off after this central point.

A long time supporter of third party solutions, I am pleased that
*someone* other than the Republicans & Democrats is doing well.  I just
wish they offered actual solutions.  If not masturbating would solve
poverty or keep people in their homes or implement a carbon tax, where
do I sign up?!

Sadly, it is all hocus pocus witch is about as effective as Nazairte
vows.  Instead, what we purchased with our vote is a House divided.  I
doubt that health care reform can do much for this lame duck.

Even more disturbing than the ousted incumbents were the ones that
remained in office.  `Harry Reid kept his seat`_, even though his
environmental record *is not* a load of toxic nuclear waste!  And how in
the hell did Rick Perry remain Governor of the great state of Texas?  He
was basically caught embezzling from the State while simultaneously
refusing to accept Federal stimulus money.  And dear lord, Jerry Brown.
 I guess he isn't going to wholesale auction off California, but I am a
firm believer in term limits.

But who cares?  Really?  When I wake up and peddle to work tomorrow, all
I will see is a glorious bubble.  I live in Austin, `now with bike
paths!`_
