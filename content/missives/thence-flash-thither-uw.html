<h2>Life Update</h2>
<br />
<div>I am not really sure where to post this, so I have decided that inSCIght is as good a place as any.</div>
<div></div>
<br />
<div>Due to our current funding round coming up during <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/sequester">the sequester</a>,  <a href="http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/">the Flash Center</a> is currently scaling back to focus on its core mission.  <strong>So my job as a Research Scientist at the University of Chicago will eventually go away.</strong>  I was not laid off today nor would I have been tomorrow.  I would have likely been able to remain at the Flash Center for up to another year.</div>
<div></div>
<br />
<div>However, I like being proactive in these situations and in being proactive new opportunities present themselves.  As of yesterday, <strong>I am now an Assistant Visiting Scientist in the Engineering Physics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</strong>  In many ways this is a return to Computational Nuclear Engineering and Fuel Cycle research.  But don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed my time researching in Plasma Physics and High-Energy Density Physics.  <em>Crescat scientia, vita excolatur!</em></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<br />
<div>From here on I'll be working with the research groups of <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ep/faculty/wilson_paul" target="_blank">Dr. Paul Wilson</a>.  Paul is very supportive of open source scientific computing and this software ecosystem as part of his critical research path.  By hiring me, relevant projects -- namely <a href="http://cyclus.github.io/">Cyclus</a> and <a href="http://pynesim.org/">PyNE</a> -- now become my full time job.   Other projects that I contribute to -- <a href="http://pytables.github.io/">PyTables</a>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/xdress/index.html">xdress</a>, and other minutia around the SciPy ecosystem -- play a synergistic role with my main duties and I am free to continue helping with.  Furthermore, after checking with the rest of the board that there were no unforeseen conflicts of interest, I will remain the treasurer and a board member for <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>.  I am very happy about this since NumFOCUS has been doing some really great things lately!</div>
<div></div>
<br />
<div>Lastly, for some family health related reasons, the position that I have taken at UW is 3/4 remote -- ie 1 week / month I will physically be in Madison.  Starting August 1, I will be moving out of Chicago begin splitting my time between Santa Barbara, Madison, and Austin.</div>
<div></div>

<div>If you have any questions for me, or just want to chat, don't hesitate to contact me and ask.</div>
<br /><div><em>Gloria perpetua!</em></div>
