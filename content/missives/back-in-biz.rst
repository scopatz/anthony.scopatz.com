Hello Everyone,

After far too long away, my website, `scopatz.com`_ (`alt link`_) is
back up! And this time should stay up!

It is all dynamic and everything. So there are some really fun things
you should watch out for. Including, but not limited to:

| --The wiley {{ footer\_adverb }}
|  --My `blog`_
|  or should I say my `blag`_
|  or perhaps my `blagoblag`_
|  or maybe my `blagoblagoblagoblagoblagoblagoblagoblag`_
|  --Very large numbers....

In any event, enjoy!
