So I hate to talk about the results for Mark (remember him ^\_-) so soon
after actually creating the account, but the preliminary results are
stellar!

So first off I have been receiving an amazing number of stalks. From
Saturday to Wednesday, half a week, Mark is up to 130 stalks/week.
Jessica (Javilina) in other news is back up to 196 stalks/week herself.

And then there is this guy, who is such a gem he deserves the rest of
the post.

|  Hey deizez,

You and flavilin both rated each other 4 or 5 stars on looks. Congrats
on the match!

We let you both know as a courtesy. You can turn this off if you'd like,
on your settings page.

|  YES! Hey. Most of my messages like this tell me that I suck because I
gave somebody a one just to see the next person- well, cool for you,
because I rock. Plus, I guess I think you rock, too, therefore the
awesome message that we gave each other high marks- and everybody needs
some love-.

Uh, neat... I don't do Texas, but I'd do you.

|  Ahahaha you had me laughing so hard with "I don't do Texas, but I'd
do you." In fact I could say the same thing Iowa. (I had an Uncle get
married there. I was not a fan of the wedding.)

I am pretty sure that this proves, sir, beyond a shadow of a doubt that
we both rock!

You look pretty cold in some of your pictures.

| Cheers,
|  Mark

|  A couple of hours ago, I made the drunken decision to make my first
iTunes rent, so I rented the movie 2 Days in Paris... I love Adam
Goldberg- he's one of my top three Jews. Did you know that in French the
name Simon sounds like our word for semen? Gross, eh?

I do rock, thank you. Oh, and the only cold thing about me is my heart.
If that was a funny "Texas is never cold joke"... ... ...well, at least
we don't live in Canada.
