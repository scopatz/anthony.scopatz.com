How is it that my jerk of a roommate can manage to meet women while I
can't? Am I too picky or is that he is established here?

I haven't posted in the last couple of days because I have been thinking
about all the dead people currently in my life. Also I have been
incredibly busy. I fankly don't know what I am doing wrong. I am no
longer desperate, just frustrated, so I shouldn't be sending off that
vibe.

I bet it is just that I am male. Maybe a little trip to Mexico is in
order.
