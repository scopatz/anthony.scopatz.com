So I had a really great weekend. First time since undergrad that I was
drinking from Thursday until Sunday. Nothing binge-worthy; just a drink
or two each night. But the best part was the spontaneity of it. I was
planning on getting work done! Pshaw.

Tony came in from Houston, so I hung out with him and others on Thursday
and Friday.

Saturday and Sunday were dominated by Super Secret Project `Two`_ and a
Nuclear program Holiday Party. Thankfully I wasn't inebriated at the
Holiday Party.

But the density of fun was intense! I haven't gone from Basketball to
Karaoke in four hours in a *very* long time.

Still, the weekend was not without its likely mistakes...
