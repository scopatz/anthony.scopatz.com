Well, every day it seems like there is more and more admin stuff to deal
with.

Hopefully I will have a roommate soon though. Also the ELO cover band
concert I thought I was going to today is actually not until tomorrow
which sucks. Oh well. I should probably do more chores now like run out
and get some groceries and find a telephone...but that is too much
trouble isn't it?
