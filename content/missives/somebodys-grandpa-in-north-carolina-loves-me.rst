This trip to Raleigh validates so many of my beliefs. Whatever started
in Gainesville has been reinforced here. I don't want to leave; What a
twist!

I do not have time to reiterate all of the lovely people here. But
Austin, you get me back. I am coming for you.

I feel that I am now loved in every corner of this big nation. And that
is important to me.
