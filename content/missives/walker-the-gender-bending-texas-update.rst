Everyone (who was reading this then) remembers my `OKC`_ `romps`_. [Yes,
I know a straight female profile needs to go up.]

So just tonight I went back to check and see how my little munchkins
were a-doing. I was floored when I saw that Mark had **75 messages** in
his inbox. And I haven't even logged on in a while! Even more shocking
(bazam!) Jessica had **93**, hawt damn! Clearly the Walkers are getting
more play than the Scopatz.

Here are some of the creepy messages I got. Enjoy the voyeurism while it
lasts!

| **#1 to Jessica--------**
|  *Hi, im 28 in the USAF and happily married to the woman i love and
would never think to leave. But lately ive wanted to experiment more
sexually and she's not into that. I just dont want to get to the end of
my life and still have regrets you know what i mean? I havnt been with
anyone else except my wife for the last 3 years, and have been tested
for STD's within the last 6 months. Check out my profile for more about
me. So if your at all interested in no strings attached casual sex, give
me a call on my cell. 402 ### ####* [from San Antonio, but Columbus, OH
area code]

| **#2 to Mark--------**
|  *so what's up with you? do u want to have alittle fun... yeah, i know
my profile says straight but i still like to have fun with guys... i
just keep it low key! :P*

| **#3 to Mark--------**
|  *you are my new leo crush and i am deeply and powerfully in love with
you over the internet. YES. i am smoking hot, a good dancer, very
attracted to you, and furthermore i'm from nashville tennessee so we can
have a country-off. or should i say... a cuntry-off?
 i have magical soothsaying abilities, and my inner eye says that i
would probably vacillate between loving and hating you, and i cannot
promise that you would not ever be injured by a bottle of wild turkey to
the head. such is life. my AIM screenname is ~blanked~ - feel free to
talk to me over the internet, because that's probably the closest you'll
ever get; i sure as hell won't drive 500 miles to see anybody i met on
the internet, not even if he had a 10-inch dick and a testicle condition
that required he empty his balls every half hour or die horribly.*

| **#4 to Mark--------**
|  *your profile is so much better than mine holy crap you have matching
pictures!*

And it is totally fake! Anyways, let me know which is your favorite. I
think I am going to have to go with either #2 the classic closet case in
one-line and, #3 the 10" penis plus testicle issue. Wellp gotta go ^\_~.
