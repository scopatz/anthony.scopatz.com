If I could shoot out my stomach and never eat again I would. At this
stage I would be some sort of undead (Wooohooo Lichdom!) Do you think
any of those hot vampire chicks would ever go for a whiny lich like me?

Speaking of inhuman interspecies relations, I saw an episode of ST:
Voyager today where a hologram/AI had fallen in love with an ex-Borg. DO
NOT WANT! The writing was terrible. The show was made of AWKWARD and
FAIL.

To complete the nerdiness of this post, I am really liking Crisis Core:
FFVII. It is basically only the best parts of FFVII proper. If you don't
recall, this is the first half of the game where it was almost pure
cyber-punk. The original of course jumped the shark some time between
when they made Red XIII an important plot character and the introduction
of Caith Sith. That's right the game was bad before the damn Chocobo
training.

Seekatz: In response to your question from when we were watching the
Star Trek: TNG series finale about a month ago I said, "You'll never
know, I'll never tell you." I'd like to add an addendum to this. I was
drunk at the time (which is what you were counting on, nicely done) so
you'll excuse the fact that I forgot to tell you that you are still
asking the wrong question. Congrats for the directness. It is certainly
a winning approach. Unfortunately, you are mis-guessing the subject
matter. I am sure you have some sort of timeline in your head. However,
your question assures me that you are still thinking too linearly, which
is why my intoxicated statement still holds. ARG'd.
