I am trying to stay awake for another hour or so, so I thought I would
post this. Basically I am calling the November US Presidential election
for the McCain/Palin ticket. We can place bets later, but here are my
reasons.

The Japanese are finally getting around to `breaking up their one-party
system`_. However, this is always hard to do in a parliamentary system
where last ditch efforts to form a coalition government are typically
successful.

However, out of Israel last week `we have similar news`_. Now, I have
never really been a fan of the Kadima party, but to their credit they
are far more moderate than many of the minor Israeli parties.

Even still, I can get behind `Tzipi Livni`_. I think she is much more
pragmatic and moderate than Sharon and Olmert were (at least where it
counts [the Palestinian situation]).

Now here is the clincher: if she can form a coalition government she
becomes the next Prime Minister. (In the West there is a lot of talk
about her being the "Second Female Israeli PM", as if this somehow
matters, since the Democrats failed to elect Hilary Clinton. Really I
don't think this matters one bit, and really isn't a novelty in a way.
Don't be fooled by the media in any way. The \*only\* way it could
matter is if the Arab world doesn't see her as being *immediately*
hostile on issues like the Palestinians and Lebanon, like they were with
her two predecessors [rightly so, as it turns out].) However, the
timeline of events works out such that Livni will either be the new
Prime Minister a couple of weeks before the November election -OR-
Israel also has to go to a general election.

Right now, it looks fairly likely that Livni will be able to pull out
some sort of government. And this is my central point. Life isn't good
enough to me for both Obama \*and\* Livni to succeed, so McCain will
probably win. Mark my words.

This is actually a safe bet for me either way if you think about it. So
who is up for it? I got $5+ on Livni forming a coalition government by
the November elections and becoming prime minister and then McCain
grabbing the presidency. We got 3 other combinations here (7 if you
wanna throw in Japan), any takers?
