I believe I have come to the point in my life where my strategy has
started to fail.

I have compartmentalized all of my friends and relations to the point
where no one is **allowed** to know the whole story. Well, maybe there
is one person who has full disclosure, but he is between a Rock- and a
Rose-place. 

| This weekend seemed to exemplify my shortcomings:
| -I don't look like the fittest guy in the room.
| -I can't hip-hop/club dance well.
| -At some point I became the straight man rather than the funny man.
| -My name is not T-Scop. 

There were two halves of my brain that I could feel very strongly.  They
could not talk to each other.  Knowing the best way doesn't mean you are
not content in discomfort.

I walk the walls of my defense network, though I tire of this duty. 

Don't take this post as overly emotional.  Rather I am deeply conflicted
over my next few moves. And the inaction quagmire is the wrong action.
