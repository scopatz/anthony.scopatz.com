Well it seems like I can't please everyone. Some people think my posts
are too long. Others feel they are too cryptic. Still others think that
my 'musings on women' and my sexuality are 'annoying.'

**Exciting News!** So given the recent criticisms, I am going to tell
you about it in a short, encoded, and peevish fashion.

So while I was in Paris, my adviser and I had a meeting where we decided
that it would be good for me to spend some time north of the wall. It is
known that it is quite a magical land up there. Which is good since
previous attempts to befriend the majestic unicorn have been successful.
So it looks like this expedition is going to take place. It took a lot
of work to get this off the ground. After all, one does not simply
jumping stilts into Mordor.

However, in the interim Super Secret Project 2 has come to a close. How
this affects the northern climes (not to mention where everyone loves
vagina) is unclear. It has also come to light that Duncan Idaho of House
Atreides has a made a similar passage to the one I am about to embark
upon. I expect an upset among expatriate Argentine cowboys.

Unlike K. D. Lang (not my brother), Super Secret Project 2 is not +5.
Maybe it is -5. Maybe it is 0. Maybe it is +2.5. Still, I now have no
desire for lollipops nor hats worn by old ladies. Despite what you
believe, people change.

**Sisyphus-like, we build. "*Things fall apart; it's scientific.*\ "**
