So my past couple of posts have been some what IN-TENTS, though for
different reasons. So tonight, even though there is a lot of serious
ground to cover, I will opt for a more playful thread.

I didn't sleep last night. I almost wish I had. But I had a very
productive morning and day and I wouldn't really trade that for
anything.

My work (aka real research) has finally started to ramp up again in
earnest. It is awesome. I love having nothing to do but to sit down at a
coffee shop, in one of many hats, and hammer out some code. I think my
goal of having the vast majority of this code done and in the bag by the
time I go out to North Carolina will be done. Thus when we go out there
it will just be running a bunch of cases. Cases! Fuck Yeah!

My stomach hates me again. I am determined to look awesome by the time I
hit California again. If you can't at least delude yourself into
believing that you are sexy during the Summer, then what is the point in
living?! If I was a hypochondriac I would totally have `SAD`_.

All in all, I am a little out of mind. Think I could make a living
writing slash?
