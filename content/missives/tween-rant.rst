I am delightfully, shamefully, obsessively enthralled by "`A Double Shot
at Love`_\ ". Much to my academic disgrace.

The show is basically a dating 'reality' show with twin bisexual women
as the love object. Separately of course. We still believe in strict
monogamy on MTV apparently. And that right there is what makes this show
amazing!

There is this carefully cultivated sense on the program that taboos are
breaking like a monster truck on thin ice. However, anything even
slightly non-whitebread is squashed rather quickly. Let's look shall we?

-  They kicked off `Claudia`_, the Dominatrix, in first episode.
-  The most wave-shot Surfer dude, `Trevor`_, is the one both the \*ikki
   twins agree on.
-  Out of the twelve women competitors only two were even vaguely butch.
-  The first was `Bella`_ who was let go in the first episode because
   she has tattoos :gasp:!
-  The second, `Nicky`_, was kicked off in the third episode because the
   twins trapped her into saying that maybe sometimes she has thought
   life would be easier if she had a penis. On some level isn't that
   just restating what feminists and equalists say about female
   inequality in this country.
-  The stereotypical frat boy `Scott`_, who is operating under some
   head-based hanky code, is still on the show.
-  Luckily, east coast elitists like `Jen`_ are eventually also weeded
   out by the non-plastic people clause.
-  However, `Coop`_ and `Ben`_, token Black and Jew, are gone in episode
   two.

Alright, so the \*ikki twins have fairly narrow vision in terms types.
They are bisexual but also bimodal: Straight Boys or
Fem-to-the-point-of-passing-as-Straight Lesbians. And the show relies on
base tropes for its `humor`_.

But then again, maybe there is something to be said for just having a
show about twin bisexual women on television. I am not saying that it is
revolutionary, but it is not without social context either (sort of like
Willow on Buffy). Let's face it. 50 years ago you couldn't have had a
show about homosexuals on TV. 25 years ago you couldn't have a show
about lesbians or gays. 10 years ago you couldn't have had a show about
bisexuals on TV.

So maybe we are progressing. Maybe we are going somewhere. Maybe we are
liberating ourselves.

But then again, `maybe not`_. Oh Mein Papa, `you are not helping`_. (On
the plus side the Google query "Gay Pope" now returns valid hits.)
