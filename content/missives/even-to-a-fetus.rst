One of `my friends`_ shared `this item`_ sometime in the past week about
the full-body scanners and backscatter x-ray machines at airports
harming pregnant women.

I am all for women, and mostly for pregnancy.  But I am also for, you
know, quantitative science and the lowly photon.  Here are some *fun
facts* that we should all know.

The radiation dose you receive from full body scanners (0.005 - 0.01
mrem) is about ten thousand times less than want you experience on an
annual basis just by living on Earth (360 mrem). Moreover it is 100
times less than your yearly dental x-rays (1 - 20 mrem). In fact, you
will be subjected to a much higher radiation exposure on the plane
flight itself than you receive by going through the scanner.

The real issue with these heinous machines is privacy, not safety (even
to a fetus).
