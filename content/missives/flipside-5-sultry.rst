Hello Again California. I mean this in two regards:

I am writing this while on the plane from Austin to Phoenix (and
then to Santa Barbara). This post is duly locked to just the California crowds, which
increasingly seem synonymous with the set of people who get to read my
private expose.

The vast majority of my negative Flipside experiences were in regards to
the women-folk who I am or was interested in. I went to Flipside with
the expectation that I would meet a bunch of new, cool people and that I
would do something more than flirt with a couple of them. For instance,
some of the days I was so sore that I would have sold my first-born for
a massage, which I never got. Naturally, I didn't make out with anyone
either, which likely condemns me to 3 more months of celibacy.

Needless to say, I am a bit disappointed. Part of this is probably that
Flipside is this sort of event. Most people come and go as a group. And
then, doing a hard sell on how awesome you are is not really tolerated.
If you have something amazing to show, bring it to the table.

The situation is definitely skewed against boys, as Jason and I found
out. This is doubly odd as there is a healthy excess margin of women
over men at this burn event. One would think that having less available
men than women (and and even proportion of homosexuals) would make boys
a slightly more desired commodity. But no. The polar opposite. The
female advantage that exists in the real world was accentuated here.
(Which was part of why putting on the dress was a smart idea.)

But all is not lost, right?! I came with not one, but two groups! Surely
someone out of the 50 odd people I knew going in must have a level of
mutual attraction with me. And having this level, it could be raised a
bit by the burn event.

..
    About half of my 6 or so bad experiences at Flipside were a result of
    awkwardness and negative vibes around Leigh from **Sparkadelica**. Leigh
    is the cool performance artist whose lollipop I drunkenly stole a couple
    of weeks ago. She seemed to flip-flop between talking to me nicely and
    being so curt that I thought she was dropping me like a bad habit, cold
    turkey.

    So I don't know if I insulted her at some point, or came on too strongly
    before, or what. I feel really bad if I did. But neither do I know what
    to do about it. She simply does not seem interested in communicating
    with me. Which is weird because I get along marvelously with her older
    sister and younger brother. I am using her as solid evidence for why I
    shouldn't date straight and narrow girls.

    Pretty much everyone else in Sparkadelica was attached. However, I am
    likely a member of **Misfits** in the first place because I met Ratha,
    builder of Yurts. We were at the big construction project assembly a
    week and a half before and I decided to talk to her because I thought
    she was hot.

    It is hard to pin down what she is thinking because she is the only
    other person I have flagged as flipping between Introvert and Extrovert
    as easily and often as I do. Unlike me though, she is default Introvert
    (I am default Extrovert) and neither does she seem to control it in the
    same way I do [not confirmed].

    I have a hard time judging whether she is interested in me or thinks of
    me as some cute, dumb kid. Ratha is a 8 years my senior, a point-of-fact
    I did not learn until the second day of Flipside. I'd swear she's 26 on
    looks alone.

We flirt. And not in the playful way that I flirt with people who I
never want to be in bed with (like 95% of my male friends). Rather more
in that subtle way that you flirt with people who you are actually
interested in, but want to test the waters with soundly first. Ratha:
"That girl was right when she said you had a sweet face." Or she'll
smile coyly when I refer to the problems with my sex life being similar
to that of a male Praying Mantis.

.. 
    But then when push comes to shove, no soap. She and her brother Tom left
    a day early. This was partially because Ratha did not feel well on the
    first day. However, it was more, from my understanding, because Tom had
    his fill and wanted to go home.

    In any event, I told Ratha that if she wanted to stay for the last night
    that she could crash in my tent and that Tom could drive their truck
    back. She didn't take me up on this offer. There are a lot of variables
    here, so maybe I shouldn't take this as a sign that she isn't
    necessarily interested. But if she had come, that would have been a
    clearer indication that she *was* interested. And maybe I would have
    actually gotten a much needed massage out of the deal.

There were other people from other camps as well, but none panned out
either. Specifically, there were a couple of girls from **Ish** who I
danced with on different nights, separately, at different places. The
come-and-go-with-your-camp phenomenon was what killed anything from
happening in spite of the beginnings of a connection.

..
    ***(Alright, time to take another breath and change tracks.)***

    So you, California, obviously remember Beanie. The girl I wrote you
    about who I made out with in my tent the week before Flipside, at Pallas
    Beltane. Here is an update.

    Beanie ended up coming to my Flipside Retox party last night, even
    though she was not actually at Flipside. Moreover, she brought me to the
    airport today. But about an hour before she was supposed to pick me up,
    I ran over to Toy Joy to get some luggage tags. Of course I ended up
    spending $20 on the *Hello Kitty* ones, but whatever. Beanie was killing
    time in Toy Joy so I poked her and we decided to leave a bit early and
    pick up some lunch.

    I am really glad that she still wants to be my friend. And as it happens
    her relationship with her boyfriend, Eric, has survived. Which is good.
    However, it was not undamaged by our experience. Which is bad. It sounds
    like they have worked through a lot of it and me being away for the
    summer can only be good on that front.

    But I did tell her what we had worked out in the last post on this
    topic. (Basically, that I was temporarily worse for the wear from the
    experience but that it probably was a net positive on my part, on the
    assumption that I didn't destroy her relationship.) I tried to reassure
    her that I take her lead in this matter. But neither does she bear all
    of the responsibility in this situation. I crossed a line that I
    shouldn't have crossed. I was being selfish. AND HOLY CRAP IS THE PLANE
    BUMPY RIGHT NOW!!!

    I feel like my part in this has reached some sort of resolution. But I
    am deeply sorry that I have caused her and Eric strife. Which still
    might make me a terrible person...
