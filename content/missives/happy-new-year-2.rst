L'Shana Tova, Everybody.

All apologies this time around seem to be going *very* well this year.
If you haven't gotten yours yet, you will. I still have a week.

Especially satisfying was an email to a certain super-marine Squid.

**On a totally unrelated note:** Being single suddenly seems a lot less
glorious than it did yesterday.

**On a totally unrelated note:** Some of you deserve better ground rules
than I have been permeating. As `Heero Yui`_ might say, "Mission
Parameters: [to be] Set. Proceeding with Mission." But let's not be
naive...

**On a totally unrelated note:** It has been recalled to my attention
that I am no longer interesting, by my own insistence. I agree that I
should be. I'm agonna reaffirm my feet here somehow. Fuck you grad
school and your boring obesity on MAH LIFE.
