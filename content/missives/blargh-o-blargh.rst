Why do all (read most) of the chicks that are on Penn and Teller's Bullshit 
have to be smokin' hot?  It is such a conundrum to see them in their physical 
glory while being throughly debunked mentally.

So I had written this whole huge post this weekend that was amazing. But
I left it o my main machine at home which has no internet. It is a
little philosophically entrenched, so ya'll will have to wait until
tomorrow to not read it. I know I loose peoples attention whenever I go
off the deep end like this. But I think this one is important.
Furthermore I expect most everyone to disagree with me, so if you don't
you should really speak up so we each know that we aren't the only whack
jobs in the world.

I took my car into the shop today to get a tune-up, new back tires, etc.
So I am with only my feets to moves mes around again.

I frankly do not know how I got any work done today at all. I listed to
the Penn Jillette radio show the \*whole\* 9-10 hrs at work today. The
show is now unfortunately off the air but the backlogs of the podcasts
are available online.

There were times when I wanted to just burst out in explosive, infantile
laughter but had to hold back since my cube-mate work totally not
understand Penn's whole day of people calling in and giving their own
obituaries was a work of comedic genius.

On the plus side of this side, I may, \*may\* get to go to ApocaLARP. I
might even get to NPC with my cousin and his new female attachment.

Also if we thought we had it bad in Austin with the Anthonies floating
around everywhere, we were dead wrong. My cousin informs me that my
friend Rachel (with whom I have a near avuncular relationship) has
dragged Andrew 4 into their friend group. At dinner at Anime Expo (which
was this pas weekend) they had Four (4) Andrews in a party of Eleven
(11).
