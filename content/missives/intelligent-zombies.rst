The past couple of night I have those special, less dry dreams that
leave one covered in fuzz and good will for the world when the sleep
finally fades.

However, the object of these sordid hallucinogenic passions has been
undead of various families.

Two nights ago it was with intelligent zombies (SYLVANASWINDRUNNER,
AMIRITE?). I did not even feel bad or dirty about this.

Last night it was with a troupe of small town lesbian vampire hunters
and the vampire herself.

Now don't get me wrong, since I only have nightmares these dreams were
horrific to the extreme.

But the sex was great so I stuck with it.
