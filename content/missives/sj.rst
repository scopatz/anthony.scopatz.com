OMFG!!!!!!

So last night when I was at guild (UT Gaming Guild) Steve Jackson
himself! walks in and asks if anyone would like to play test some of the
games he brought! Holy Moley! He brought this really fun pyramid game
that was an abstract counting game.

It turns out that he lives in Austin and is looking for a group to
permenantly be his UT Austin playtesters. How cool is that?! In a month
or two we get to alpha test Munchkin: Impossible.

He really is a nice man and cute in that sort of grandatherly way.
