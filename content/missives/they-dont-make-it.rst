They Don't Make It

SO I went down to LA tis weekend and visited friends from college and
before. It always amazes me how old friends fit like a pair of old
shoes. Comfortable and warm, enjoyable and meant for each other are
these relationships. What I love most about these times is how little it
matters what the two of you have done in the intervening time. You just
put 'em on and run.

You are not friends because of the difference that currently keep you
apart, but are friends because you are there in the moment with each
other. This camaraderie is refreshing. The Post-Masters-Degree-Coital
high was fun and lasted a couple of days, but I quickly got sick of it
in some ways. The fact that with certain friends it doesn't matter
either way is spectacular. This is mainly true for the friends that were
spared the destruction while it occurred (Sorry Austin).

Also I am always pleased at the selection my cousin's entourage makes in
terms of adding new people to their greater friend group. I have yet to
be disappointed. Even if these are merely fair-weather friends, the sea
is clam, the sky is blue, the wind is solid, and it is smooth sailing
from here.
