...But I am a a little \*chan / ED obsessed right now.

soup lj? Life keeps happening to me, ya know. It ain't half as bad as
most of teh copypasta stuff on /b/ that will make you shit bricks, but
it still gets me down. I know the internet is serious business (BTW you
just lost), but it is my only source of lulz. I don't want to become an
hero. I feel as dirty as a forced meme. Since I use linux ::facepalm:: I
can't even let out my frustrations in an MS paint "Story of My Life".
And for the record, I did not do WTC. in b4 more pooper. Whatevs, Im
hungry.

brb, soup
