So I have spent the time since my last post traveling around and seeing
peoples.

Last night, Meenon and Jessica Simpson (still hilarious) had some good
things to say about Enigmas to me. Without getting into it, balance of
interest and honesty at the early stages of a non-relationship is
something that they have a unique perspective on (among my friends).

This morning+, Meenon and I went lingerie shopping (for her, not me
though I did see some fun stuff). We in fact went to Fredrick's of
Hollywood ***in Hollywood!*** It was fun and helped with a costume idea
about gloves. We had pizza for lunch.

Perhaps most importantly we went to this fairly famous (though the name
escapes me) film bookstore in Hollywood. They also happen to have a
bunch of movie stills and posters. Unfortunately, they did not have a
poster of "Her Wild Oat". However, they did have a bunch of Coleen Moore
stills. I ended up buying five (5) of them ^\_^.

After that I drove down to San Diego in the afternoon. I met up with
Kerry Deuce for dinner and then we hung out for a few hours. It was a
good time. Now I am here in the hotel in SD with my family.
