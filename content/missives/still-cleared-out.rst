So I am currently killing time in Hollywood. Specifically, I went to
`Larry Edmunds Bookshop`_ to pick up some more stills. I have been
planning this for months. It didn't quite work though, since the list of
names I brought in was not what they had available. This didn't stop me
from buying anything though ~\_~. We just had to be creative with what
we looked up.

I restrained myself and \*only\* purchased one `Colleen Moore`_ still.
She is dressed in traditional Spanish/Mexican garb. It is
hilarious/awesome. All of their Seven Samurai folder was cleared out and
so I could not get a picture of `Keiko Tsushima`_ (who plays the
sexually active girl in Seven Samurai). Also their folder's for "Nights
of Cabiria" and "la Strada" were empty. So the picking for `Guilietta
Masina`_ were very slim. But I did manage to get a few decent ones.
Specifically, `this one`_.

And randomly I found a poster for "`Dangerous Curves`_\ " featuring
Clara Bow. It screamed out "Don't You Want Me?!" So I bought it.
