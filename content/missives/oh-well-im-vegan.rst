Sorry, If I made anyone feel uncomfortable today. Today was quick. I
really am not upset at anyone.

Once again, if you can mention when I bring up accidentally bring up
something explicitly that I don't want to talk about this would help me
greatly in being able to curb this behavior, which is something \*I\*
want to do. I, of course, will attempt to do this with out impinging on
any of my reserved exuberance.

I am trying hard not to be lame; please feel free to help in anyway you
so desire.

Thanks for putting up with my antics. It is total bullshit I know.
