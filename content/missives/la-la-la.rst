So I finally made it to LA.

More or less peeps all up and down the CA coast agree it is time. If you
don't know what I am talking about, that is ok too.

On a totally unrelated note, at least three people know what Super
Secret Project 2 is.

The days are filled with driving and seeing friends for like 2-4 hours
and then moving on to the next bunch. As whirlwind as it is, I love them
all and wouldn't trade this vacation for the world. Even though it is
crazy I am still managing to recharge.

Of particular interest is that I am so euphoric about the experience, I
don't find moving from one social structure to the next the least bit
jarring. Maybe it is all the pent up emotion and ways to communicate and
knowing that I have to express myself NOW or it simply won't happen.

I could use a shave with Occam's Razor.
