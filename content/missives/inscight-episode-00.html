Welcome to the inSCIght, the scientific computing podcast!
</p>

<p>
In our first episode we have a review of the recent O'Reilly Strata Conference.  This leads into a larger discussion of what is "Big Data", who uses it, and how to steward it for future generations.
</p>

<p>
On today's show our crew of hosts includes:
<ul>
  <li>Puneet Kishor</li>
  <li>Anthony Scopatz (moderator)</li>
  <li>Kaitlin Thaney (special guest)</li>
  <li>Peter Wang</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This week <strong>Kaitlin Thaney</strong> joins us from London and Digital Science, a new technology company dedicated to bridging the gaps between the analog and digital research world through tools, services and better use of technology. She comes from the open science world, most recently serving as manager of the science programs at Creative Commons. She is passionate about interoperability, making research more efficient, and, in her spare time, runs a London-based sci/tech meetup called 'sameAs'.
