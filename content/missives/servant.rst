Through a meadow opening in the pine woods I see snowy peaks about the
head-waters of the Merced above Yosemite. How near they seem and how
clear their outlines on the blue air, or rather *in* the blue air; for
they seem to be saturated with it. How consuming strong the invitation
they extend! Shall I be allowed to go to them? Night and day I'll pray
that I may, but it seems too good to be true. Some one worthy will go,
able for the Godful work, yet as far as I can I must drift about these
love-monuments mountains, glad to be a servant of servants in so holy a
wilderness.
