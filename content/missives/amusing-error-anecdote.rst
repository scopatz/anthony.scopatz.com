Last night, I was on the phone with my mother trying to explain the
problems I was having with my research. Right now, I am doing
uncertainty analysis and I was getting results whose error was seven
orders of magnitude greater than the actual data value. Clearly this is
wrong.

So I used the following analogy to get across the problem to my mom: "It
is like thinking you have one M&M, you know, plus or minus 10 million
M&Ms."

Mom: "Yikes! That is a lot of variance!"

Me: "Yup...And what I'd really like is one M&M plus or minus half an
M&M."

Mom: "So, give or take an 'M'."

I thought it was cute. I wonder if this is a good way to teach error
analysis. It worked seamlessly here...
