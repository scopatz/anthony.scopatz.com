So at the ANS Student conference, at the last nights dinner they handed
out bingo cards. The cards contained phrases that if a speaker said
them, you could mark it down, and you know play bingo. Silly, right?

But I noticed that the words in the little boxes formed word phrase
primitives. Sweet! So I put a few cards together and then spun a quarter
on top of them. Where the quarter landed I would record the phrase. Here
are the top three "random" sentences that I got.

-  104 reactors operating in US Hydrogen production secure the borders
   against HEU (Highly Enriched Uranium) knowledge transfer.
-  I wish I were in your shoes 9/11.
-  A number of nuclear students enrolled in airplane impact at the
   mention of TMI (Three Mile Island) or Chernobyl.

BINGO!
