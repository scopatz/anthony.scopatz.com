So in the event that you have been living under a Pop Music rock this
summer, the big hit right now is Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl (and I
Liked It)".

Every summer, there is one pop song that both tops the charts and I find
guiltily irresistible. Last year it was Rhianna's "Umbrella"; two years
ago it was Gnarls Barkley's "Crazy". This year it is definitely "I
Kissed a Girl".

This song is especially interesting since it really throws the
gender-bending norms right in ones face. On the surface, the lyrics are
about a young, straight-defined woman who is experimenting with other
women. Given that women's sexuality seems to be more fluid than men and
that girl on girl kissing is rather commonplace, the song doesn't really
seem to be breaking any huge molds here. However, Ms. Perry makes her
sexuality a bit more explicit with lines like "I don't even know your
name/It doesn't matter." Indicating that her homo-desires are raw and
explicit.

However, the lyrics are only one side of the gender-bending of this
song. The actual orchestration I can only describe as a confusion of
Pop/Techno and traditional Hair Metal. The latter is particularly
interesting since this was primarily the domain of men of the
stroke-my-enormous-cock-OMG-I-am-a-rock-star variety. Otherwise, the
song is well within the "Look at me I am breaking boundaries" domain.
This type typically bores me since the boundaries (which is true here)
have been broken since the dawn of girls mackin' with other chix.

However via `Coverville`_, I found out about `Max Vernon's`_ amazing
cover!

You might be tempted to then say, "Haha, knock-up job mate! Now
everything is all heteronormative now again!" But I assure you that this
is about as far from the truth as can be.

Max changes almost none of the words. Thus the lines that go "I kissed a
girl/Hope my boyfriend don't mind it" take on a even more distinctly
homosexual twist. With Katy Perry's version, there is a girl having a
first lesbian encounter, where as with Max there is a boy having his
first straight encounter.

Furthermore, Max also changes the instrumentation significantly. Where
Katy was using male-oriented methods to really drive her gender play
home, Mr. Vernon does the same thing. Max's take on the song make you
think it is a piano solo for the first have. When more players come in,
they are much lower in intensity than the original. One might even
describe his version as the more feminine.

In summary, both songs are sexy and amazing. I strongly encourage a
sampling.
