*Is Elvis Dead?*

    -  Yes
    -  No
    -  Maybe
    -  Maybe Not

So New Years Eve was fun. But then again, it was terrible. A couple of
seeds that were planted in 2008 came to fruition and I am not entirely
pleased with the yield. Still, I am enough of an academic to appreciate
the results even if they are disappointing.

I think I communicate in a fundamentally deviant way. However, no matter
how often I try to explain to people what (little?) I have been able to
figure out, it still seems like I need training wheels to cope with my
friends and they need training wheels for me.

So rather than listing resolutions, here are some of my trip-ups that I
hope to learn from.

**Mistakes:**

-  **Extro-/Introvert:** So apparently everyone under the sun believes
   that I am an Extrovert. I thought I made it pretty clear that I flip
   between the two based on the taxonomy of those I am around AND that
   largely the Extroverted personality is a mask because "being
   Extroverted is more socially acceptable" [Keirsey, et al]. Even my
   Introverted friends don't like it when I am Introverted. Isn't this
   incentive to not be "who I really am" [whatever that means]?
-  **`Trolling:`_** There are clearly major modal communication
   differences between myself and my friends. The most common way that
   these manifest is through the use of Trolling. Just because many
   people in a group wish to use this method of communication doesn't
   imply that it isn't something I am not sensitive to nor that I enjoy
   it. On the one hand, I am willing to meet people halfway and
   compromise. On the other hand, If I tell people that they have
   crossed the line a dozen times and they refuse to alter their
   behavior it shows me that they don't really value me as a friend.
-  **Blake:** I am so sorry and I did deserve the troll. Even if you
   weren't offended, I still find my own behavior abhorrent. Not that
   you can read this because the post is locked.
-  **Social Contract:** I think it has now been shown, twice and
   painfully, that the relationship contract that currently exists for
   my friends needs errata. Once again I am eager to meet everyone
   halfway. I want *constructive, active, descriptive feedback* on my
   life and for my friends to challenge and watch out for me. (I
   understand that this may be confusing since there are certainly
   things I won't talk about, but other than those topics everything is
   fair game.) And also, I absolutely 100% require Respect in
   Friendship. No respect is clear grounds for termination. But what do
   you want? For me not to generate drama? I am fine with that; I don't
   like drama and try to minimize it. But is drama 'over(?)analyzing'
   things? I don't have a concept of limits here. Please help!
-  **Desperado:** I don't want to be drunk and be taken advantage of.
   Yes, I did give my consent, but I was rather inebriated and tried
   saying "No" for like an hour (in drunk-time). I was under the
   impression that my friends would step up and stop me from doing
   something drunk that I would regret. Unfortunately, because of
   **{Social Contract}** and the fact that \*some\* friends could not
   stand, let alone step anywhere, intervention did not occur. It was
   slutty in all of the bad ways and none of the good. (And before
   anyone from Live Oak says it, Dion++)

I realize that these are all my problems. And like Dan Savage says, I am
the lowest common denominator in all of them. But this is why I am slow:
I have identified what I need to change, but the option-space of what to
change into is So LARGE that without your help I won't ever be able to
narrow it down to a few reasonable choices.

GRAH GRAH GRAH Angry at self and others! How many times can my
self-image be shattered in a day and for me to still remain sane? I
think I need some sort of stabilizing drugs. Maybe I should self
medicate. Booze.
