George Carlin once wrote that "the wrong two Beatles died first."

I realize he was older and that these things happen. But it is still sad
to see him go. He was one of the few comedians left of his era.

You'll likely hear a lot of talk about him being a free-speech advocate,
and not \*just\* a funnyman. In truth he was both. Of the crowd that was
Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, I can only name Paul Krassner as still
alive.

Of course, others carry on this torch. Penn & Teller carry on this
tradition. I would be lying if I said these comedians did not affect my
conceptual continuity.

On the other hand I bought some chocolate covered sunflower seeds.
Eating them is so tasty and sacrilegious. Almost as if I am deflowering
them....
