The first five people to respond to this post will get some form of art,
by me, that is in some fashion about them. I make no guarantees about
quality or type, scratch that , I do make assurances about its quality.
It will probably be poor. But my love and home-style cooking will go
into that art!

The only catch: as with most memes, if you sign up, you really should
put this in your own journal as well. Give to receive and all that.

If anyone who is close by responds, the probability that you get
preformance art is very high.
