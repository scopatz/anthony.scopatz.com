God I love living in Austin. This really is the best place in the world.

I know there are skeptics who read this. But those people don't get
`this`_ `guy`_ hopping around outside their house!

Apparently, these things are called `jumping stilts`_ and can really
wear you out very quickly.  Anderson, as he introduced himself, said
that he used to get weird looks.  Then one day he put the ears on his
helmet and people loved it!  He has a female friend who occasionally
goes out with him and she wears cat ears!  How amazingly cool is that?!

See this is why my city is better than yours.  Unless of course, you
also live in Austin.  I'll share, I guess.

EDIT: I added some extra `photo galleries of Mark and Jessica`_  to my
website, for those interested.
