Sorry to Ramone this place, but it really blows here.

I was at the YMCA the other day and while I was leaving this odd fellow
shambled into the locker room.

It turns out he is an Artist and his medium is old telephone wire. He
had a slurred speech pattern with many stop gaps in inappropriate
places. He claims to have done an American flag and a baseball cap that
made it into the Smithsonian.

So there was this older, crazy man talking to me. He told me all about
life and how precious every day was. I am pretty sure he blessed me with
some heathen ritual. I smiled and nodded.

I then found out he had brain cancer and had just passed the five year
mark from when it was removed.

Soundly put in my place I reevaluated my stance of this place as Hell;
maybe it is simply a Purgatory where people wait to die? It is still
Hell.

I also just saw my first two Punks in this place. They were walking out
as I was walking in. The male looked like my former roommate Josh only
taller, stronger, and with an actual Mohawk. The female had bright
orange short hair and was earing some sort of black, badass shirt. She
was wearing an incongruous white skirt and flip-flops though.

They were the most attractive couple I have seen here. I had to keep
myself from staring as I knew it would be misinterpreted.

Probably the closest I'll ever come to a live SLC Punk except that is
where I lay my head tonight!

Out of Idaho! Woohoo!
