Ok so I just got back from LA. Fun times all around. I could go into
more detail but I really don't feel like it. Well, Ok I saw Lydia and
Andrew and Meenon and Maggie and Paul Krassner and Roy Zimmerman.
However,....<br><br>Let
me reiterate. This is a Private Journal. It is strictly read at your
own risk. I started it on the recomendation of my therapist. I tried
writing in a private hand-written one. Didin't work. It is easiest to
type here. 

<!--
This journal is written with one and only one audiance in
mind: Dr. Wax. If you are not Dr. Wax or are not mature enough to be a
pure Voyer then I urge you to stop reading. It will only hurt you. <br><br>This
IS MY space to let out my inner psyche. A lot of what I say here is
categorecally false. Most of this blog is a knee-jerk reaction. I first
response. Through reading "Please Understand Me", I understand that a
lot (about 40%) of people can only have a knee-jerk response. I am
capable of more as are most of my friends. If you feel uncomfortable
about this site, understand that this is NOt how I necessarily feel or
think about people. Only what I think. Would you dare venture into the
inner workings of anothers mind? Do you even think about yours? <br><br>This
takes a skilled proffesional, of which I am not. However I am being
introspective and am thinking about my thoughts and this helps. <br>
<br>NO ONE IS FUCKING SAFE HERE!!!! THIS MEANS YOU!!!! GET THE FUCK OUT!!!<br>
<br>Brendan, Jon, Kerry, If this journal is too disruptive to you and your life I beg of you do not read.  <br><br>Syd,
This ceratinly was not intended for you. But am I suppossed to
apologize because you snuck into my closet and think my dity closes
smell? I think not. Besides it is impossible to determine who soiled
this landaury in the first place. Whoever pointed you here, if they did
so knowing you are an introvert, then they only did so to hurt you. If
this was me, then it is pretty obvious that some part of me wants to
hurt you and this FUCKING Journal is how I control it. What do you want
from me..to join a convent. Do you really want me to physically attack
you or dan? I don't. Give me some outlet and stop torturing me by
trying to change me into you without giving back at all! If you are
upset abou the emails, know they were for my therapist. Oh wait...a
holier than thou moment coming....At least I don't involve any friends
in a relationship who can be affected by it. This may be an exageration
but..."Hmmm Dan, should I break up with Tony and instead suck YOUR
cock?" Dan may have the capasity to be rational but he still thinks
with his dick and not his head or heart.<br><br>I would like everyone
to please note that I have never, ever said an unkind word about Syd or
Dan. To me only actions count. This is MY stream of conciousness..not
yours. This does not count as an action anymore than thinking these
thoughts and keepeing them bottled up or telling Dr. Wax. <br><br>Whenever
anyone has ever said "Syd, what a bitch" or "Oh I used to like Dan" I
have always defended you two. I have always encouraged my friends to
come to their own conclutions and Know that I, despite everything,
wanted to remain their friend. If truly pressured I have always told
the truth, which is that I feel betrayed by both but for some dumb
reason I still feel Syd has value in my life. Even now; this very
moment.<br><br>I know that my thoughts if ever expressed would only
drive Syd and Dan Closer. Watch as it does. What did I do to desvere
such total and utter rejection from two who once called me friend? To
my mind, very little. To express such thoughts is not publiclly
acceptable. As intimate as two people get, it is still public. This,
fortunately is not the public in any local sense<br><br>It interests me
that Syd would suddenly, after I broke off contact with her, be
interested in how I am thinking. For the last year and a half of our
relationship she showed no inkling or care at all to what I was
thinking or even how I was feeling. Wanting to be alone in my grief di
not mean that I didn't love her and she was wrong to think so. If you
are still reading then It means you are a Voyer and I hold no duty to
you. I feel no social kindness to not offend. This is my mind and not
yours.<br><br>I realize that things I associate in my mind with Syd and
Dan still hold value apart from them. I hope they do the same. I also
understand that I inherited the Dan curse and can only pray it has run
its course. I fear that with this speci-man it has only just begun.<br><br>However, I have rejected the more nerdy activities which make them such losers now.<br><br>Syd
would only make such an incendiary post about me on her live journal if
she still cared about me in some manner. Clearly the number of posts on
mine about her indicates that I still care about her. I think a lot of
her anger comes out of her being rejected by me. She had yet to be
dumped. Now she in some small faction knows how it feels. What must
really kill her about all this is that I haven't gone off the deepend
and called her anything crazy like a "pedophile". I really did cut off
contact with her because I felt it was in my emotional best interest,
which is something akin to why she broke up with me and started going
out with Dan. Life works in mysteroious ways.<br><br>Self-Referential
of the day: Posting about how stupid it makes a person when they have a
Holier-than-thou post, makes your post Holier-Than-Thou and thus you
just as stupid.
