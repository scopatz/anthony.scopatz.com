So tonight I started taking the jump. I disassembled my main machine and
I am turning it into my server. This should allow my server to be up 99%
of the time rather than the 1% it has been.

However, this mean that I am now functionally without a Main, powerhouse
computer myself. Which implies I will be living off of the school laptop
for a while. Soooo you know what this means...

I think if I do this right I might be able to satisfy ALL of my
ridiculous desires on my budget.

| **Here is my hilarious server build:**
|  Bare Essentials Gentoo Install
|  HUGE, Old Dell Server Box
|  3Ghz Pentium 4
|  40 Gb HDD
|  ATI Radeon 9600 All-In-Wonder,
|  and 256 Mb RAM ^\_~

Anyone wanna go to Fry's with me in the near future?
