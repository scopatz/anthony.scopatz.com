Yeah, I totally missed a week...and this weeks film was with a bunch of
other people on Saturday. `More broken things have happened.`_

**`Jacob's Ladder (1990)`_:** In honor of Halloween, we watched a film
that wasn't so old, but no less forgotten. We had the opportunity to
also watch `Tetsuo: The Iron Man`_ from a year before, but some people
were too silly drunk and some people were too sleepy and and some
peoples spoon's were too big.

The movie itself, was pretty triptastic. It basically followed a three
parallel stories (OMG HeavenHellPurgatory!!1!). But the weaving was done
very well. There were many cries of "Silent Hill!" throughout. Even
though part of the story took place in Vietnam, this was more or less a
plot device and not sufficient commentary to be meaningful. About the
only moral lesson you could squeeze out of the Vietnam parts was that
Chemists are terrible people, but we knew that already. And they knew
that then. It is/was not news. Though I do know good chemists too. The
twist on this theme was that Chemists are worse people when they are
Hippies.

And the chick named Jezzie (Jezy?) was hot. Because how could she not
be? And not just because we saw her boobs. In that 30 seconds she was on
screen before she jumped into the shower with our
fantastically-out-of-his-mind hero, I thought she was cute. Even if
people mispronouncing her name sounded like penis. I swear, is
\*nothing\* sacred to you people? The next time you all come over and I
make drinks, you are all getting Penis Coladas.
