| I must drink beer.
|  Beer is the mind-killer.
|  Beer is the little buzz that brings total hardcore crunkness.
|  I will face this beer.
|  I will permit it to pass into me and through me.
|  And when it has gone I will turn the barstool to see the rest of the
bar.
|  When the beer is gone there will be none left.
|  Only one Bourbon and one Scotch.

If you couldn't tell I went drinking last night.

This is surprising because I was not planning on having a drop at all in
this hell-hole of a state.

I was sort of dragged out to this comedy club thing last night. I wasn't
planning on going at all; instead I was going to organize part of my
home file system. As I was doing this though I came across an old text
document that contained part of an old AIM conversation that Sean and I
had. It was like he reached cross the years and put me in my place. I
laughed so hard I was on the floor. I went to the comedy club.

This guy Jake, who Josh works with and I could easily call friend, was
not yet at the venue and was press-ganged into picking me up. This meant
I wasn't driving.

He picked me up at the Mormon Temple, wind blowing through my hair and
telephone receiver. However, there was a girl in the passenger seat.
Odd, Josh hadn't mentioned anyone else and by Jake's own account from
the day before he was single.

She was introduced as Ariel, Jake's sister. So I had heard of her, I
just wasn't aware of her presence in Idaho. Jake had mentioned she used
to live in the City. Other than that....

We made it over to the club, where precisely Two (2) events of note
occurred. The rest was a typical, well-played social encounter. You can
fill in the gaps.

1) My eyes turned green. Real Green. The kind of color they only change
to on special occasions. Most of the time when I see a fine girl my eyes
turn blue out of defeat. Green. This is something else.

2) After they comedy was over they brought out a DJ and laid some phat
beats. The group of like 9 of us went to the floor for various time
periods. The odd thing was that this big in all dimensions man
thuggishly tapped me on the shoulder after the music had stopped and the
floor was clearing.

| “We're leaving.” I said.
|  “I'm not a bouncer dude...” he responded and I looked at him blankly.
|  “... That girl over there wants to talk to you dude.”
|  “What the fuck are you talking about man. Go away.” I left.

The girl was surrounded by a veritable posse of others. I am glad that
even in my much inebriated state that I could smell the stink on this.
Strange.

The night was not without mistakes. Early yesterday I had planned to
tell all new people, when they asked me what I do, that I am a writer.
If they probed deeper I would be forced to tell them I am merely an
academic.

I totally forgot to do this with Ariel, but I was with her brother and
another coworker so it probably wouldn't have worked. But if it had it
would hve been beautiful since she has a degree in English.

I have a lot of unanswered question on how to proceed from here. My
intentions are not pure and that is the way I like it.

Even if everything from here on out goes awful, at the very least this
is a good case study.

Last night was amazing. I really enjoyed myself. I guess some fun
quantum tunneled into Idaho.

| My son found a nice little vixian
|  He tells me she's a wealthy Ixian.
|  But for my Jewish boy
|  Never a Goy.
|  And besides she is such a shiksian.
