I saw a woman in Central market today who looked a lot like Jessie.  It
wasn't, but she even had your fashion sense.  Not everyone can wear
**lime green** jeans and matching spaghetti string top and get away with
it.

Jessie, if you are out there, somewhere, online let me know.  It would
be nice to talk to you again.
