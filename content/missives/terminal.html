So I am sitting here at a terminal in the library. It is superbly
beautiful day and I feel well dressed. Perhaps a little too warmly for
this weather. I hope I get to go to Irvine this weekend. Since Other
Andrew can't make it out we are looking for alternitive ways to have
fun. With Andrew, of course, this means exploring my more nerdy
pursuits. In all likely hood I will end up raiding with the guild and
then playing some DnD. This might be a nice change of pace for me.
Also, it means I get to see Mowi and seriously, how many more times am
I gonna get to do that. <br><br>There
is some weird Abortion campaing goingon outside. I am not really sure
what there deal is, but I now know I have an instictual reation to run
when I see a seven foot tall fetus.<br><br>I think I may have relapsed
into caring about the Dan-Syd thing which is bad. This morning was
tough after it hadn't been bad for a couple of weeks. It wasn't that
bad but I gotta nip it in the bud now. <br><br>Other than that there
is a lot of stress in school right now. Not really in my classes but
more involved with getting out of them. At this point my classes are a
drop in the bucket for the rest of the quarter. However, They are doing
my final requirement check today and I'll know tomorrow one way or the
other whether I get to graduate for sure or not. In addition to that,
even though the deadline is next week, I am not able to register for
comencement online. This is bad because it might mean that even though
I will get a degree saying I can talk the talk they might not let me
walk the walk. The people are real slimeballs about it too, just like
ETS or the College Board. Their website, The Office of Student Events,
only lists their phone number (which leads only to an answering
machine), an email (which no one checks), and a mailing address (which
on a university campus has no relation to the actual location). They
literally make it impossible for you to walk in and ask a quick
question. Brilliantly, however, after visiting the Registar today I
popped by the Visitor's Centor on campus and asked them. It turns out
the office isn't even on Campus!!! It is at an off campus research
center, WTF! I didn't have time to go to my car and go there today but
I will tomorrow. If they don't listen to my pleas of "I paid $100K to
go here, let me walk in the silly ceremony. How many years have you
been doing this again?" Then I will get my parents (who actually did
pay the 100K) to go in and do the same. It really is the only way
things get done around here. Or in this case, it is the only way things
get done NOT around here.
