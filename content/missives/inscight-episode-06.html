Bootstrap yourself in and prepare for episode 6! This week we discuss the Cython project and some of the impressive things you can do with this ever-more essential language. The skinny is that code written in Cython can be compiled to C, which in turn can be compiled by your favorite C compiler. Cython's syntax is very similar to Python, but gives you the full power of C and the CPython interpreter. Oh, and you can use it for C++ and Fortran as well!

This week <strong>Chris Colbert</strong> joins us from Enthought where he is a scientific software developer with a background in mechanical engineering, robotics, and computer vision. He feels that Python + Cython provides one of the most formidable computing platforms available today; striking a superb balance between performance, library support, and developer productivity.
