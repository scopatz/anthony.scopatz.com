I saw a really cool pink film called Daydream. It is a Japanese flick
from 1964.

It was one of those films I only I like and everyone else hates; and I
\*loved\* it.

It had much in common with Tetsuo: the Iron Man in terms of themes of
human degradation my technology/machines and how this leads to
degradation by/to other humans.

Robin may like this film. Most others (the ones who "get" it) likely
wouldn't dig it.

Beyond any plot or morals, It was beautifully shot and magnificently
executed. Also, the main villain was a vampire and totally bad ass in
certain parts of the film.
