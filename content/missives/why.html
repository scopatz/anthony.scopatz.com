Why is Dan Such a fucking Dork!   (&lt;---Note: not a question)<br><br>I
thought we had an implicit understanding That in terms of dining
commons I would fucking eat at the far away ones (DLG and Ortega) if he
would fucking eat at the close one, Carrillo. My Schedual was thrown
off today because I had to pick up my mom from surgery and sure enough
he is fucking sitting in DLG. What the fuck? Un-Fuck you, Dan. Some
people have no respeto. Is he that dumb? Does he want a fucking
confrontaion with me. I half wanted to go in there and yell at him, but
since I saw him first I just went on over to Ortega. Still this really
upsets me.<br><br>I want to kick his ass eight ways from sunday.<br><br>

Must restrain self....<br>
<!--
<br>In all seriousness, I don't really want to hurt or kill Dan or for this to
happen to him, I just think that the world would be a better place
without asshole cowards like that in it and he should have never been
born. It is my understanding that he is an accident anways. So I say,
Un-Fuck You Dan.
