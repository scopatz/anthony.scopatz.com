I feel like I should make a post, now, at 2 am. But I also feel that
anything I write will be incomplete until the weekend is over.

So for those of you who don't know, I passed my PhD Proposal Defense on
Tuesday. So other than some coursework, this was literally my last
hurdle before I go up to defend the real deal next May! ::crosses
fingers::

The experience left me drained more than excited. But in celebration, I
ate some things that I knew would hurt my stomach. And they did.
However, I resisted buying Newman-O's. Chocolate is almost entirely out
of my diet. For shame. I \*love\* chocolate!

On the other hand, I feel that my private life is moving in the right
direction. ::knock on wood:: Garrick made a comment a while back that
went something along the lines of me being "75% recovered". I took
exception to that at the time, but now I think I know what he was
driving at. Hopefully I am closer. Garrick also has a way of sticking
numbers to things which really ain't got no business havin' numbers on
'em.

So between the PhD drain and the private positives, I feel very manic
when I am alone. Whatever recent experience my mind decides to replay is
what emotional state I fall into. Here's to the next couple of days
bringing more good things to focus on for the week ahead!

Goodnight, Austin, Texas where ever you are.
