I sawr the Rutles movie again last night. It was but my second time. The
funny thing is that the first time around I failed to noticed is that
they have some Indian guy playing the George character.

Mostly I have been working a bunch here. Which ain't too bad.

I have also been working out at the YMCA here in an attempt to conquer
my stomach.

The scale I have been using here at my parents house is doing wacky
things and I am not sure I trust the one at the Y here either.

You scored as **Either**, You brain is neither specifically male, nor
female in the way you perceive your surroundings. As bad as this may
sound to some, it can easily mean that you are capable of combining both
gender aspects to your advantage. Rather than being genderless you are
possibly able think freely. This does not mean that you are bisexual or
androgynous or indecisive, but it might.

So I am androgynous...I think we all knew that, except for the beard.

I swear somewhere in here there is an inner man that just wants to play
football and fuck sheep.

Which bring up an interesting point. Growing up I used to look really
effeminate and was made fun of on this front all the time. Which was why
I was so pleased to have facial hair. Then in college I shaved for a
brief time and within a couple of weeks I was getting "Excuse me Miss".
The beard came back!

I wonder how well I could shake the drag thing again. I'll need to
conquer the stomach thing first to be really successful. Halloween? I am
not promising nor threatening anything.
