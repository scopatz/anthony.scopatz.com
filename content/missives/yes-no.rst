So my website is down and will likely be so for a couple of weeks until
my roommates leave. I am in the middle of a huge war with them. Long
story short, I have turned off all power at my place except when I need
it. It should be back up on the 21st.

Also I took Tara to the Airport this morning. We had a rocking time at
TC's last night. It was wonderful having her here. I'll post more
details when I am at home.
