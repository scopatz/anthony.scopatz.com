In episode 3, we add a dash of experimentalists to the show. The purpose of tonight's episode is to drive home the fact that computers are fundamentally analogue devices.
</p>

<p>
Every time we execute code or move the mouse around the screen, a physical process is occurring on our CPUs. Today we attempt explore the whole vertical from basic semi-conductor research, through analogue-to-digital conversion via embedded systems, to finally tie back into the programmatic abstractions most of us at inSCIght know and love.
</p>

<p>
This episode is really a sounding board for future episodes that are more grounded in hardware. So please let us know what YOU think, what you liked and didn't like about today's show.

This week <strong>Jes Sherman</strong> joins us from the University of California, Santa Barbara where she is a second-year PhD student who specializes in organic electronics. Her research focuses around the effect of crystal packing on charge transport in organic semiconductors. She also blogs at the ever-irreverent <a href="http://www.coronene.com/blog/">Carbon-Based Curiosities</a> (Psi*Psi).
