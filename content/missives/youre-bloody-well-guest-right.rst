Like any dispossessed youth, I have plans for getting out of this place
Sue; Ima gonna make a name for myself, I am. Only "here" is my seemingly
eternal obsession with "A Song of Ice and Fire" and my plans basically
consist of temporarily satiating myself with other epic literature.

So right now I am reading through the `Ramayana`_. I am really loving
the ride. As sort of a Classics guy, the Ramayana fires off all of those
lovely Indo-European neurons that I have carefully developed to the
detriment of more practical affairs. To those of you that know
classicists, you know \*exactly\* what I am talking about. To those of
you that don't, it is kind of like being the biggest D&D nerd in the
world EXCEPT that the only people you can play with are either dead or
in your imagination.

More on all of the awesome little titbits later; suffice to say it is
exhilarating in that way that when you *first* read the Odyssey, or the
Arthurian legends, or Beowulf, etc. But there is one topic which has so
much cross over that it deserves its own post. And I have been thinking
about it lately, as well: **Guest Right**.

Guest Right was a legal, moral, ethical tradition that was held
throughout vast portions of the ancient world but which is now all but
forgotten. It more or less says that guests hold a sacred position in
their hosts abode. Guest right was triggered in different ways, but
breaking it was almost always considered sacrilegious. Here are a couple
of examples.

| **1)** To the Greeks (and others) it was not permissible to ask your
guest's name or business unless they offered it. A great example of this
is when Odysseus washes up on an island and is hosted by the Phaeacians.
|  **2)** A more extreme Greek example occurs in `Book 6 of the Iliad`_.
Diomedes and Glaucus, mortal enemies on opposing sides realized that
Diomedes' grandfather once hosted Glaucus' grandfather. They therefore
just \*have\* to be friends and run off and happily kill other people.
These seems strange to the modern ear, but sets the stage for when...
|  **3)** In the Ramayana, the sage Vishwaamitra is given guest right by
`King Dasaratha`_ (Rama's father). Now the king had to perform an
amazing and expensive ritual just to have children. This ritual amounted
to having a horse roam free for a year (while an army followed it,
maintaining it's "freedom") before sacrificing it. But Vishwaamitra
walks in when Rama is 15 and is granted a guest right boon. He demands
Rama to help him kill some Raksasas. The King is reticent but,
ultimately guest right wins out and Rama leaves with the sage. Puts the
Abraham-Issac story in perspective...
|  **4)** Of course, it is possible for a guest to break guest right.
For instance, being a suitor to another man's wife and living off the
fat of his land for 20 years, like in the Odyssey.

Well, those are all nice stories, but I swear I am going somewhere with
this.

I have often been discontented with modern interpretation of the `Story
of Lot`_. Modernity has forgotten about guest right. But Judaism (as an
ancient religion) has a strong tradition of Guest Right, and generally
not forsaking strangers and sojourners for we were once strangers and
sojourners. This is certainly lost in today's world. There are so many
strangers, we hardly care. We can't even open half-way houses anymore...

But Lot kinda gets the shaft in recent interpretations. In fact, he is
often cited as why the Torah represents an outdated, outmoded codex. The
bleeding edge example of this is Bill Maher in `Religulous`_. However,
if we throw guest right back in with all of its intensity, Lot gets a
different take.

When the mob descends on Lot's family, the angels (though their divinity
was unknown to Lot, as per standard guest right) were under Lot's
protection. Though the mob was doing a grave injustice to him, Lot was
trying to maintain what he could of civility. Yes, offering up his
daughters was is a shitty thing to do. But to the ancient moral compass
it was the lesser of two evils.

Modern dialogue frames Lot as the real villain (or at least anti-hero)
in this situation. They fail to account for the frame or reference in
which the Torah was both written AND received. Moreover, these
interpretations gloss over the fact that the mob are in fact the ones
committing the crime.

Guests \*were\* people to be honoured and revered; not to be thrown out
even before the garbage that is our modern capitalistic
every-one-for-themselves way. If you wanna talk about the evils of
patriarchy and homophobia, there are PLENTY of current examples without
turning to a misinterpreted parable from ages-gone-by.

Totally my two cents, here.
