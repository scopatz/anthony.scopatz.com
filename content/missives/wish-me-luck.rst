2) I am giving my talk in a few hours.

3) I am still kinda sick.

4) I am in Idaho.

5) I am flying back home tomorrow, you know. Which happens to be 9/11.

6) Vehicles have had a tenancy to break or otherwise be destroyed with
regards to my transportation in and out of this state.

7) Still in Idaho.

worth. However it happens to be he capital of Idaho! Oy Gevult!
