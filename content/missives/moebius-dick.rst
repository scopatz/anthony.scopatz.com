| What is Non-Orientable and lives in the sea?
| Moebius Dick!

So other than not much happening today, not much happened. However I
have made Two (2) really cool updates to my website.

1) I added the Protomen pictures from their Hollywood concert to my
website. http://scopatz.com/photos/index.php?album=Proto

2) I embedded my google calender for viewing onto my website. It is
under the "When" tab. Basically this means that if you wanna know my
schedule, you just have to go to my website. Pretty cool huh? Accessible
via http://scopatz.com/#When

I know would like to start a discussion though. Here is the question: Is
it manipulation of other people to change yourself based on their
actions?

Some points to consider:

1. It is clearly social manipulation as you are part of the social
   group and changing yourself has some effect not only on you but the
   whole group dynamic.
2. Does intention matter? If you change yourself merely with the
   intent of changing someone else's beliefs or mannerisms, is that then
   manipulation of other people?
3. Does the contrapositive to 2 hold? Namely, is it manipulation of
   the other person to change yourself based on their actions, not caring
   if or not wanting the other person to change?

Ok that is all, hotstuff.
