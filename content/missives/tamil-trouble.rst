Alright folks, I rarely proselytize. So that should note to you that
this is important.

In event that you don't know, the `Tamil people`_ are the ethnic
minority in `Sri Lanka`_. The history of the Tamil's shows striking
parallels to that of my own people. I don't have the space here to go
into full, comparative detail. So let's start with modern history then.

Most people in the United States are keenly aware of the strife that
British Empire introduced to the Middle East with their policy of
Partition for Israel/Palestine in 1948. To a lesser extent, we
understand that our chums across the pond created huge problems for the
world when they partitioned India from Pakistan at the same time. What
is not well known here is that at the same time that India and Pakistan
were split, Sri Lanka was made into a separate sovereignty.

Stemming from the independence came many problems. Mired in history that
I am not covering here, Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority and the Tamil
minority have been effectively at war since 1948. From such a prolonged
conflict has come many unsavoury types and deeds on both sides. I am not
here to argue who was worse when. I am here to sue for pluralism.

In a recent push, the Sinhalese-majority government declawed the
Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam, the Tamil's former military
establishment. However, it appears that this has been just the first
step in a larger attempt on genocide on the Sri Lankan Tamils.

I bring this up now on the urging of one of my friends and her mother.
They are Tamil living in diaspora. Specifically, they requested for me
to bring to the attention of my friends and relations a recent
condemnation of the Sri Lankan government made by `Elie Wiesel`_, the
famous holocaust survivor and author.

`TAMIL PEOPLE STATEMENT:`_

Wherever minorities are being persecuted we must raise our voices to
protest.  According to reliable sources, the Tamil people are being
disenfranchised and victimized by the Sri Lanka authorities.  This
injustice must stop.  The Tamil people must be allowed to live in peace
and flourish in their homeland.

- Elie Wiesel, June 30th 2009

Please, if there is any news outlet, religious organization, or the like
that you could forward this statement onto, I know it would be
appreciated.  Help send the message that this sort of inhuman behaviour
will not be tolerated in the 21st century.  You have my personal
gratitude.
