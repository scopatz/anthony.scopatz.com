Ok! Last weekend I went to Gainesville for a conference. I was expecting
it to suck (as per last year) and therefore I would get some time to
post. But no! It was freaking fantastic. Here is the fallout. Ok maybe
fallout isn't the best term for a nuclear engineering congress...

Well, it seems as if the Austin Experiment turned out to be the `Grand
Illusion`_. I expected to be more upset, I suppose, but really, it is
another data point in the convergence loop of my life (more on this
later).

So rather than being all bent out of the shape, I am determined to go
North of the Wall and maybe find me a unicorn or something. Really I
only have `one`_ more year here in Austin and then the entire world is
open to me! How fucking pimp is that?! Yo, werd!

More seriously, I can easily fill a year with research. I can think of
at least 4 full papers that I want to write in the next year. Hopefully
at least two of these will pan out.

So it is clear that the conference motivated me. Good. It did.

I have about a month before I go up to defend my PhD proposal. Luckily,
I have so many potential avenues to exploit, writing the document in the
next week and half, shouldn't be a problem in the least. It is looking
like I am gonna do this thing; I am going to get my PhD! Victory!
