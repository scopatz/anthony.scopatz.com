Sorry for being all emo and shit last night.

Normally that isn't what this is for. I have had a particularly rough
Yom Kippur and the High Holy days preceding have faired little better.

Since my chaotic life is in a constant state of change, I have been
fighting desperately lately to change for the better.

However, as in the sermon I heard last night said, doing the right thing
does not always feel good and the temptation to do the wrong thing often
seems easier in the short term.

To that end I have resolved to not hate this year. To say no more evil
words. I do not fear this change, though it has caused me some strife,
in the long run it will do me good.

I have thrown down my weapons forged against my adversaries. I hope they
do the same, turning foe to indifferent stranger.

Know that I forgive you, and I do so all the time. I may only let you
know once a year, but with every step and with every breath it is true.

One may romance the man in the street, but for now I will leave him be
with his coffee, two creams, and three sugars.
