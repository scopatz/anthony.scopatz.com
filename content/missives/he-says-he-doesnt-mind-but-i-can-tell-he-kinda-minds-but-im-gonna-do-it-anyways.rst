So the people that need to know have mostly been told. My K.D. Lang-ing
has gotten out of hand. Every day or two I am intensely broken-hearted.
I am not sure if this desire is really justified. I feel that there is
and was a connection and that is certainly important. Meanwhile, in a
cruel twist of fate, the Austin populous has gotten significantly
hotter. Would it be right to pass up Austin opportunities just for a
chance to record on her album? Fuck, are there Austin opportunities?
Will there be a rally in Raleigh?

Just because they are foxier doesn't mean they are anymore available,
were I the last girl on Earth. The Economist: "*The city's dykes mostly
stood firm.*\ " If only they were talking about womenfolk. Or Austin.

I wanna be whomever she want me to be. But I don't know who that is. I
don't think we ever really find out who our partners want us to be. We
simply get better at guessing.

The *right* answer to this question is to just be myself! But like that
`the Who song`_, my definition of self is so fluid it is hard for me to
pin down. If you have been the test subject of my recent beard/no-beard
rants, I apologize. Or if you have ever been clothes shopping with me,
you also know this. Every article is a statement of purpose.

It is so much easier to just adjust to someone's expectations. But I
have to respect that person, and they have to be at least as deviant as
I am. I fucking wasn't always this way. I used to just not care. But the
joys of social engineering have ruined such apathy for me.

I feel like a fat lump of `Gundamium`_ (a lame, non-existent plot
device) without her. She knows who Yusaf Islam is and my heart grows
fonder with every mile.

Oh K.D. Lang, are you just a unicorn?! I look forward to the day when I
may cry "`Hallelujah!`_\ "
