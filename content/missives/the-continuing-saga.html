Here is the latest installment of the DLG-emails. I fera I amy have
been too harsh, howver I don't think I said anything half as harsh as I
have posted on this blog.
<!--
<br><br><br>Syd:<br>dear tone<br> <br>hmmm now i want to see trigun all the more. <br>as
tired as i was last night some part of me thought i missed the thrill
of RP in between the wispy corners of sleepiness and the jagged edges
of ow-my-tummy.<br>i understand what you are saying about not being
able to distinguish between the pains of the situation and the sadness
of leaving in the first place. i have been thinking so much about that
lately...i so sorely hope to continue to see people into the summer...<br>i
do, however, continue to think of it as my responsibility. if only i
had been more in touch with my feelings and more realistic we might
have effected a much healthier separation. and if i had had the
self-control to keep my feelings for He who must not be named a secret
for a few months none of this pain and suffering would have
happened--except of course for the pain and suffering of
leaving/graduating... <br>i am not sure that the solution you hinted
at will ever occur to him, however, especially since he is aware of how
much you seem to prefer avoidance. he would probably feel bad
contacting you even in an apologetic vein. and i do not think it will
occur to him to apologize--i think he has a strong impression of our
relationship having been pretty painful for me as he was always there
in your room when you gave me the cold shoulder and of course never
there at the moments of our greatest intimacy. so you have to realize
that to a certain extent he usually saw us acting unhappily. if this,
my estimation, is an accurate one of his mindset (and who knows) then
he probably thinks that *you* should apologize instead. maybe I should
tell him that both you and i have apoligized to each other and then he
would understand the complexity of the situation. tell me what you
think about this please--i won't make any move until we've discussed it.<br> <br>I guess he was at DLG when he thought you were in lab.  he will make a more concerted effort about that if you like.<br> <br>i'm glad i saw you today...<br>baci,<br><br>Tony:<br>Dear Syd, My Response:<br><br>"
i do, however, continue to think of it as my responsibility. if only i

for a few months none of this pain and suffering would have
happened--except of course for the pain and suffering of
leaving/graduating... "<br><br><br>This is why I am upset at you. This
was the one condition of having a reltionship with me that you
violated. You kept it a secret. You lied (includes withholding key
information) about at it to my face. I have, arguably, been through
more relationships than the entire rest of our friend group
(discounting Shawn if you count one night stands). I made it very clear
(I thought) at the beggining that if you were ever thinking about a
relationship with someone else, I would need to be told about it. This
was the opposite of what happened and what had been going on for many
months I suspect. I do not feel bad, therefore for doing the same to
you. However, I may have saved the relationship by telling you but all
things considered I doubt that. He who shall not be named lied many
times to me as well. This only adds to my anger against him. It is one
thing to commit a dishonorabl act, it is another yet again to conceal
it. People in my situation are not stupid. Treating us as such only
makes the situation worse. But we live and learn and my hope is that
you won't be epimethian for the rest of your life.<br> <br><br>" i am
not sure that the solution you hinted at will ever occur to him,
however, especially since he is aware of how much you seem to prefer
avoidance. he would probably feel bad contacting you even in an
apologetic vein. and i do not think it will occur to him to

having been pretty painful for me as he was always there in your room

moments of our greatest intimacy. so you have to realize that to a
certain extent he usually saw us acting unhappily. if this, my
estimation, is an accurate one of his mindset (and who knows) then he
probably thinks that *you* should apologize instead."<br><br><br>Of
course, he has to deface me so that I am less than who I am so that he
may justify in his mind the actions which he has committed. In effect,
he became not my friend so that he could get a quick lay and not feel
bad about it. Also, as much as I hated it coming from your mouth you
were right we never were friends in any traditional sense. Even when I
was noticlby feeling bad he would never approcah me and ask if every
thing was alright (as even a moderate friend would). Even, at your
prompting, when I would tell him things with out being asked he would
shrug them off and offer no support and be generally very cold about
it. I let sleeping dofs lie, and figured that he simply did not what to
get involved. I however made the mistake that he was an actual friend.
How many years has this man been apathetic towards me...waiting. How
much do you wanna bet that he didn't apply to Grad school hoping that I
would leave just so he could interject himself into your pants. <br><br>I
am a good person and have done him no wrong, and have done no wrong to
you that was not the result of a mutual disagreement (for which as you
have pointed out we have already both apologized for).<br><br>I believe
he does not understand some pretty basic things about relationships,
such as not butting into others business and that they are all
categorically painful. Even my relationship with Kerry V., which
was the most casual and whimsical one to date, hurt me and her deeply I
am sure.<br><br>The oint of this is that if he is too blind or scared
to apologize and try to make amends then that means to me that he must
not want to. One of the central things we agree on, philisophically you
and I, is what I label as existentialism. Really, only actions count to
me. If he wants to apologize it will not count unless he does. I did
not make this situation, I will not be the one to unmake it any further
than I already have. <br><br>I am not the type of bitch to bend over
and take it in the ass when my friends abandon/hurt me. I get the Fuck
out. I have seen to many of my other friends destroyed by hanging
around too long. At this point I could care less about how he feels. I
hope you understand<br><br><br>" maybe I should tell him that both you
and i have apoligized to each other and then he would understand the
complexity of the situation. tell me what you think about this
please--i won't make any move until we've discussed it. "<br><br><br>He
was not/is not in our relationship. Do not overstep your boundries.
Doing this would ruin any chance of ever having a resolution. My terms
are that he does not get specific guidance in this matter, and the only
person you control is yourself. Also, I do not kiss and tell, I would
prefer you do the same. I.E. if you repsect me at all, do not discuss
our relationship in any detail with any future partners. I deserve my
privacy. General situation ok, but he hardly needs that.<br><br>"    I guess he was at DLG when he thought you were in lab.  he will make a more concerted effort about that if you like. "<br><br><br>That
is either an outright lie or an oversight. He KNOWS that lab is never
held on friday for either section. All that I ask in this last month of
Hell that I have here on campus is for me to never have to see his ugly
mug again, at least until such a time as some resoultion can be
confered, at which point the subject is once again open. <br><br>I
should be able to be free to eat at DLG anytime I wish, just as he is
free to eat at Carrillo any time he wishes without me showing up to
piss him off. I want to be gentelmanly about this. He is not to eat at
DLG again, period. I shall not eat at Carrillo, it is really that
simple. Another observed violation and my methods for broaching the
subjcet will be more direct.<br><br>"    i'm glad i saw you today..."<br><br><br><br>Me too! I hope to see yo at some point this week before the weekend.<br><br>I
am sorry If this letter was a bit harsh. I really don't like talking
about it, but the whole DLG thing brouhgt it up again. I apologize for
the severity, but I assure you it is not one hundredth as severe as I
feel. I am sure teh same goes all around. It is funny how we mask our
feeling to get through the day. Reminds me of Los Banos or Lancaster
for some reason.<br><br>Be Well<br>Anthony</td></tr>
