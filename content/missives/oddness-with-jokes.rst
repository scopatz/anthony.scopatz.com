| Q: Why is having a wife and a mistress better than getting a divorce
and then remarrying?
|  A: Atreides never as satisfying.

I hung out with Jake and Josh last night at Josh's house. This was after
my crushing defeat at the hands of Google Maps.

We worked out in Josh's father's AMAZING home gym. We lifted weight ad I
was clearly the weakling. Which makes sense sine I do mostly aerobics
and the others were much taller and/or stronger. I did my personal best
and am paying for it today.

Jake turns out to be an interesting person. He has some very interesting
and hard to deny political ideas. For one thing he is a hardcore
Capitalist to the extent only Kerry Prime can match. Politically he is
otherwise rather liberal/libertarian. He kinda reminds me of Tara in
these respects.

Also he is buff. I want his body. To be in it...not to just do floral
arrangements with.

I started using my Mentat training to pump him for information about his
family and therefore his sister, Ariel.

Ariel is six years older than him. He expressed some intriguing ideas
about his relationship.

1) Because of the age difference, he didn't feel like he grew up with
her. Which is odd to me since I feel like I am growing up with Jules and
he is nine years my youth.

2) He claims she can be grating on him since she takes a sort of
"better-than-you" mentality, with him at the very least.

3) Because of 2 he claims tat they don't hang out much and aren't that
friendly.

Clearly they don't have a perfect relationship (but who does).

Status: I have copy of "Dune" waiting to give to Ariel, on the condition
she passes it off to someone else after she is done, should I ever run
into her again.

Now for the interesting stuff:

Since Jake and I are new friends with this new information, it might
uncomfortable to make a pass at Ariel, especially through him. Which was
the Prime Projection before yesterday. Now, it would be even stranger.

But what is really intriguing is that in some sense, I want to hand off
this book and let her make the decision. This is TOTALLY Weak!

I don't think I have ever made a solid, boldfaced advancement in my
life. At least not to anyone who I thought was a serious possibility. I
always try to find all relevant facts and then manipulate others into
making the call.

What is even more odd about this situation is that even my minor pursuit
could jeopardize seriously the limited friend group I have in Idaho.

In some sense this makes me want to do it even more. Or be even more
bold. Just to see how people react. I would do this thing to add to my
knowledge base.

Isn't it wonderful how selfish I am?

What would happen if I asked Jake to give Ariel the book? Her phone
number? 'Found' her at her work?

I haven't settled on a strategy yet. I have decided to wait until after
the Bar Mitzvah to make my move.

I think everyone I am related to has been touched by Loki. We all pull
this shit. Some of do it for the good of humanity while others just for
themselves. I used to be the former, but I am moving slowly toward the
latter.

I apologize is this post was a little too Whiny. Was it?

| Q: Why was the God-Emperor of Dune complacent with the plot to kill
him by throwing him off of a bridge?
|  A: Well, you can Leto horse to water....
