Episode 16 is in a 'Lightning Round' style where each of our panelists brings a topic to the discussion. We then proceed to hack it out, as briefly as possible. The three rounds this week are numpy's storied datetime implementation, trying to mix domain specific languages, and workflow management for the common experimentalist!
