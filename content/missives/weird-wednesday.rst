I went to see the Weird Wednesday movie at the Alamo. It was pretty
strange. It was called "Massacre of Pleasure". It was one of those
movies that I love but because of that I wouldn't recommend it to
anyone.

I hate telling people my major...no one ever knows what to say. Well,
save this one crass Math grad student who said it was a dying field.

I hope Kerry Prime feels better.
