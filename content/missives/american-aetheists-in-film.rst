This movie was one of the hottest films I have ever seen. So first off
it was amazing. Last year I also saw a film that became one of my
favorites called "Girl with the Hat Box". That one was this hilarious
Russian slapstick.

"The Godless Girl" is a Cecil B. DeMille flick and based on this one
films of his, I think I am a fan. Probably not in the way he was
meaning, but there really were some amazing shots (like the cut away of
the school house riot) that were chaotic and gorgeous.

Here is why the movie was so sexy though other than all of the actresses
being cute to hot. Most of it took place in a "Reform School" which was
essentially a prison. One side was boys and the other side was girls.

One of my favorite (read hedonisticly satisfying) is when the godless
girl Judy is being inducted into the prison and they forcibly cut her
hair. Now, her hair already only barely touched her ear lobes. The funny
part of the story is hat at first she doesn't appear to know what is
going on and sits down and asks Mame, the hair dresser, to style it a
particular way. Mame proceeds to cut just a huge part off of the top and
Judy's face drops. At the end of the ensuing physical struggle Judy has
this wild and unplanned, unorganized hair. It is like some black
mountain range jetting out in any direction the wind has shaped the
rock. Judy becomes an untouchable Daphne, at least until her hair grows
back out some.

It should be noted that the uniforms are amazingly sexy.

The audience itself was amazing. They would boo and hiss or laugh at
every intolerant Chirstian thing the Bob character said and they would
cheer whenever anyone from the Junior Atheist club did something heroic.

The movie was simply epic and you should really see it.

Philosophically, even though the movie was made with a Christian tone,
the Atheists were only anti-Christian. Now this is very interesting
because all devout Atheists that I know or know of that actively espouse
and proselytize their beliefs are essentially anti-Christian and never
or rarely seem to address other theistic belief systems that to me
personally make more sense. So as not to name friends, Penn Jillete is
one of these. Now you can say we are in America so it is the topical
group to fight against. But as a coherent philosophy, this is really
only saying their is no Christian god. Now before I get off track an go
on a logic using rant about the things that bother me about the modern
Atheist movement, I'll make my point. Most of the time I think Atheist
project themselves exclusively (or nearly so) as anti-Christians, where
as in "the Godless Girl" a Christian was portraying them as
anti-Christian.

We should all get together and see it at some point. Ryan really like it too.
And here I go off on a movies again..
