...Has been averted.

I came on here to say that I feel that whenever people have an easy or a
difficult way to do things, if they sat down and thoght about the
situation, most people will instincually do things the difficult way. (I
am not free from guilt on this) This is really frustrating me.

I, as you may know, am having roommate problems and these people make
every possible move to put them in my bad graces. I think they like to
see if they can get a rise out of me. I am doing well to ignore them,
usually, to their faces. However, they are giving me emotional
flashbacks to a time when two of my closest friends killed themselves in
haste. I do not need this stress in my life. I do not need this drama in
my life. I am one of the more reslient people out there. If I wasn't
then I would not have survived. If I had not come here to Austin, I
doubt I would have made it. I certainly wouldn't have in SB.

I feel that I will always lead an unsatisfied life. This is positive in
the sense that it drives me, it is my method for perserverance in the
face of extreme challenges such as Graduate School. However it leaves me
bitter and unhappy.

I see all of the uplifting posts comming out of Thanksgiving and know
not whether this is a sign of a positive turn of events or just more
evidence that I walk a seperate path.

In any event, it is likely time that I sought out a therapist again.
(note: all paragraphs have started with 'I's. Signifigant? No; chance.)
All-in-all I am doing ok, this was just a rant. I am kinda sad and
lonely, and The people I know here, don't yet know me well enough to be
able to respond well to my disperate moods...well not all of them. I
just want people to play nice.
