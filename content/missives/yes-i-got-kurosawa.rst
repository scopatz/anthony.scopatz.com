Action-packed, light romance maybe with situation humor but with a moral
to your story, this Japanese master filmmaker would make your film an
instant cult classic -- were he still alive. This is the guy who made
the movie on which George Lucas' Star Wars is based (The Hidden
Fortress). Also his movie Seven Samurai inspired the American classic
The Magnificient Seven. I think you now have a hint how your bio film is
gonna turn out. Rather than hire George Lucas, let's dig up Kurosawa to
create the classic spectacle that is your life. A simple drama with
light touches of comedy, but a big budget.
