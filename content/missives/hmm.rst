So here I am again....sitting in the Texas French Bread Co. This time
however, there is a cute girl with blue streaks in there hair. I really
shouldn't say girl since she looks 2-6 years my senior. However she is
busy flirting with an coworker of clear Irish descent.

Yesterday was kinda a non day, and today is poised to be the same. I
forgot Costco doesn't take credit cards and felt like a big jerk when I
had to walk away from my order.

I did see "Snakes on a Plane" However. Super funny. It is clear to me
that the internet contributions of this movie made it so much better
than it would have been otherwise. Also the main villian looked
suprisingly like Eric Ballo and had a simillar weapon choice. Go Fig
^\_^
