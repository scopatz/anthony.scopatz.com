So Kerry did this cool thing where she posted the first sentence from
the first post of every month this year. I figured this would be cute,
so I'll proceede hence.

[[...sometime later...]]

However, this made me sound like a terrible/nerdy person so I am going
to post the sentence of the last post of each month, December excluded.
That makes this list very short. You will live.

| May: What a dolt.
|  June: Self-Referential of the day: Posting about how stupid it makes
a person when they have a Holier-than-thou post, makes your post
Holier-Than-Thou and thus you just as stupid.
|  August: I mean maybe not to Heinleinian depths...but at least a
little.
|  September: My HackMaster forums with more info about the game world
can be found at http://www.guildut.org/forum/index.php?showforum=39
|  October: Tomorrow is a new day.
|  November: I just want people to play nice.

See, wasn't that much tamer and more humorous? Also, less nerdy I
warrent (you should have seen it before).
