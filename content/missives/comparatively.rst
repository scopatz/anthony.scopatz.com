So the Facebook compare people applet is totally messed up.

I know you knew this, but I will explain. Currently my "Where do I fit
in?" page yields the following results.

1) Which I have complained about before I stand with 3/3 votes for being
funnier. Whatevs.

2) I "win" (term used loosely) The best dancer with 2/2 votes. Frankly,
I have no idea who has even seen me dance let alone what possible
crappyness has been dredged up against me.

3) I apparently lost with 0/2 votes the most outgoing. I think I am
pretty damned outgoing (at times). Who are these fonts of
extrovertedness?

I spent most of the day in services as will be the fate of my tomorrow.
However I did finish my little book of poetry and prose which I bought.
Let me tell you it was amazing! Who would have known I would have been
so into it. There are a couple poems that stick out in my mind. One is
entitled "The Chef is Delicious" and the other is called "Interview".

The truth be told though, I bought the book for the first short story
which is a very gripping and condensed retelling of the Odyssey. What is
rather intriguing about this version is that it totally elides the
presence of Telemachus, is told in the first person by Odysseus himself,
and contains this amazingly interesting part after where Homer leaves
off wherein Odysseus in his old age takes a crew retracing the steps of
his wanderings before returning home to die. Amazing!

The other short story in the book and the essay as well were almost as
good.

is no accounting for the bovine stupidity of mankind.
