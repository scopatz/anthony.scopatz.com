Hello All, I have made it safe and sound to Santa Barbara/Santa Ynez! I
know I promised not to write anymore about Flipside, but there are a
couple of quick things that need addressing and then I may make a post
about Religion later. Stay tuned.

**Retox:**

Thanks to everyone who made it to `my Flipside Retox Party!`_ It was a
very relaxed and pleasant experience. `It was probably a good thing that
we didn't go downtown`_.

If you couldn't make it out, then next year. And maybe I won't host it
on a Thursday nor run out of Vodka.

**Pictures:**

In addition to `my lame Flipside pictures`_, I want to give a big shout
out to ! He has posted some of `his Flipside pictures.`_

And since this is my personal blog, here are some of my favorite
pictures that he took of me. We'll start with one of the Acrobatic Yoga
/ Pirate Outfit ones.

And then we'll move on to the Valkyrie playing with spin sticks. (Now on
Facebook!)

But really, Flipside is a matching Hat and Sarong affair.
