I sit in my room. My walls are now mostly bare save for products of mine
hand and Ong-bak and SFSFF posters. My attempts at retooling the world I
exist in are coming along.

Tommy and I lifted weights today. It was delightful, but boy am I
feeling it.

Additionally, My car is fixed now. It turned out it was the alternator.
It runs like a dream now and I am quite pleased.

I want to rust the world.
