I will reclaim my life someday...I swear it.

I think I am near rebuilding my life. Unfortunately, it is not quite my
dream home due to budget constraints. There is no pressing reason to
demolish it, but I expect I will have another opportunity come this
summer and my impending move to Idaho.

Knowing that I am near done, I may as well scrap the project and start
anew.

I don't even know how I could possibly say that I was near done; if only
you were here to have seen my diminished state at the end of this week.
My brain is dead and my roommate's cat is fucking my ex. I think I need
a new heart.
