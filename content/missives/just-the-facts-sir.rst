This update is a little overdue in some senses. But I needed the time to
cool off and put someone's head on my shoulders.

Everyone's life is always a probability tree. Mine is more so now than
it has been since I have moved to Austin. What follows is a qualitative
diagram what \*may\* happen. I am neglecting to put numbers down,
because frankly it is too woeful to think about.

| 1) I pass the quals when I retake them in January.
|  \_\_\_A) I stay at UT until I get my PhD.

| 2) I fail the quals in January.
|  \_\_\_A) Under the departmental rules I am therefore kicked out of UT and out of a job.
|  \_\_\_\_\_\_i) I must find something else to do. Though my parents have offered to float me for a time, I am unsure if this is responsibleon my part
|  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_a) Get a crap job to make ends meet somewhere around Austin.
|  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_b) Find a "career"-esque job. This may or may not take me away from Austin (hopefully NO) and may or may not take me to California (if I have to go somewhere :shrug:) and may or may not be at a national lab (please NO!!!).
|  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_c) Study for the LSAT and go to law school. I still haven't married a lawyer, so law school is still on the table ^\_^.
|  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_d) Go to grad school at UT elsewhere but almost certainly in another field. I have forsaken Physics (discovered that the emotional block seems to be permanent). So I would likely switch to comp-sci or comp-engineering or something. But we shouldn't overlook the possibility that I am simply not cut out to be an academic. I have had this creeping fear for a while.

| \_\_\_B) There \*might\* (so Josh tells me) exist a provision by which students whom have failed the qualifier twice but the professors believe actually know the material are allowed to take the test a third and last time.
|  \_\_\_\_\_\_i) GOTO 1.

Seeya in February where ever I am. If you are reading this and assuming
that it isn't that bad and I that I am blowing things out of scale, let
me assure you that it is that bad. Somehow I thought that taking the
hard way would be easier.

PS I have beaten Dynasty Warriors: Gundam. Needless to say, it was
amazing....just like Disgaea 3 =).
