| To the ancient Greek writer, Herodotus,
|  Said a pretty young thing, "My how hard it is!"
|  Said he, "Do you fear
|  I will hurt you, my dear?"
|  And she said, "Are you crazy? Thank God it is!"

--Isaac Asimov

Asimov would clearly trump both Lupin III and Duncan Idaho.

The library here is an interesting place. The only graffiti I have
noticed here is on the inner wall of the male down stairs bathroom stall
and it reads simply: "BOOK".

Maybe they are still learning. Other choice bits I have read across town
include "I believe in faeries" and "Anarchy is Cool."

I'll admit. I have been listening to Nightwish on my Zune at work. It
makes me feel cool. I can't explain it. I shouldn't even try to. For
some reason, in these moments all thoughts and feelings of camp in the
work are expunged and I fall into the simple joy of rockin' out to the
best power cords in the UNIVERSE. See how Idaho brings out the best in
me.

My cousin Aaron wrote the Wired Article about the last interview with
Mr. Wizard (which h actually conducted).

--Also Asimov

| Said Joe, "When I leave my young Stephanie,
|  Her cries of unhappiness deafen me.
|  But I make no apology,
|  I rely on technology,
|  And screw her by wireless telephony."
