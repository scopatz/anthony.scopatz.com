One of my friends got mugged yesterday. Pretty sad,huh? I think so. I
would like to think taht the place I live is safe, but, what can I do
eh?

On the other hand I had my first dream about Fuel Cycles. I was moving
all of this Uranium around from one place to another and seperating the
Actinides and Pu (it was clearly not a once through cycle). It was
pretty crazy.
