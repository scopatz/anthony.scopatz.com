I am posting now because I am sick of writing. My paper that is. I am
really just editing now...the annoying part. I finished the graphic
novel `"Watchmen"`_.

| As always, I need to start off with some disclaimers:
|  1) **There will be spoilers.**
|  2) I \*really\* did enjoy the ride.
|  3) The back cover calls the work "Peerless".

Overall, I liked it and felt compelled to keep reading. In that OCD
kinda way. There were some things that they did very very right in this
comic. The first of these, which is awesome, is that Rorschach's face
changes in each panel. Secondly, the gimmick of having plain-text
portions at the end of each chapter that give in character background
information is brilliant.

However, this gimmick actually turns out to be one of my larger
criticisms against "Watchmen". The story involves a decent number of
characters from rather distinct backgrounds. So maybe I have gone soft
via `GRRM`_, but I now expect different characters to have different
voices. This means that the author has to take on a different writing
style to accommodate the character that is speaking. Normally, this
isn't a problem with comics because the voices are all flat and you are
STARING at the character talking. But there were really only 5 voices 1)
Rorschach, 2) Walter Kovacs, 3) Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, 4) the
newspaper man (generic Brooklyn stereotype), 5) and everyone else.

My basic point is that Hollis shouldn't sound Dan Dreiberg who shouldn't
sound like Sally Jupiter who shouldn't sound like the Comedian, etc.
This really limited my ability to suspend my disbelief, because it was
no longer the characters speaking, but rather the author talking TO me.
I was starting to see this but the real clincher is that plain-text
gimmick at the end of every chapter. The first couple are by Hollis
Mason (retired Nite Owl #1) and the third is by Dr. Manhattan. They are
written in the same style. NOOOO. They comic continually tries to make
the case that Dr. Manhattan is now no longer quite human. He really
shouldn't be sharing the same speech patterns with the psychologist.

The other thing about Dr. Manhattan is that by his own admission there
is no reason to be blue.

I did like that the bad guy won, and that the bad guy was a good guy
acting with the best of intentions (even if he stood to make a profit
off of it). I also like that Veidt won over Dr. Manhattan to his evil
scheme with LOGIC. But then Dr. Manhattan admits that even if Rorschach
were to make it back to civilization that no one would take him
seriously as he is a criminal and monkey-off-of-his-nuts crazy. However,
that Dr. Manhattan then goes and kills Rorschach unceremoniously, out of
hand really bothers me. This does not follow LOGIC.

There were some cute devices like Robert Redford (RR, totally not Ronald
Reagan) running for president. But for everyone of these there was a
laborious passage by Dreiberg (or, THE AUTHOR) talking about Art thinly
disguised as ornithology.

Lastly, I am fine with the leveling of New York as a plot device. But
c'mon, did it really need to be Cthulhu? After all that, we get to some
inter-dimensional, squid-monster, Elder-being, unknowable H.P. Lovecraft
fan service?

So in summary, Watchmen was cool. It was fun. But it certainly wasn't
because it was without peer.
