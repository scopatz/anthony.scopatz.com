So yeah, I went out to the apartment last night to visit Shawn. We tried
to take a bus downtown but we missed it. Instead we stayed at his place
and saved a bunch of money by making drinks there. I cannot tell you
what I had to drink last night. Actually this might be a funn exercise,
I'll try.<br><br>Half a beer<br>A shot of Whiskey<br>Coke with two shots of rum + lime.<br>Caipeirosca (that is totally misspelled, it is a really good brazillian drink)<br>Another half a beer<br>Another Shot of Whiskey<br>A Shot of whiskey in a back alley way<br>and a Shot of Whiskey to finish it off.<br><br>This
is good, it helps me predict when I'll be sober again. But yeah, Pretty
early on, Syd came and joined us and then when we were about to leave
the house to go to a ba and walk down DP I made Jon leave his Woman
(World of Warcraft) and come with us. Unfortunately IV SUCKS ASS. It
was 11:40 and the bars had already given last call. WTF! It just meant
I saved more money. In any event, we went on DP (I was far and wide the
most shickered btw). Obeying the Scopatz principle of Equishittynessall
music was equally bad. However there were two crappy live bads. For the
record, I really enjoyed myself at the time. Howevere much the two
bands were alike in shittyness, the second band had a far better
drummer. So I liked those guys more.<br><br>I think the key to getting
to the point where you are kinda out of it is not just a lot of booze
but also the will power. Also I am pretty certain that not drinking
water really until you are done drinking helps a lot.<br><br>I saw
Duncan Neilsen Last Night! He goes to City College and we totally ran
into each other on DP. Syd knows Nick so I introduced her. What is with
getting tipsey and then seeing people from my past.<br><br>I am
secretly hoping that I can get inebriated enough that I can then induce
a high that will resemble a drug trip. I can already kind of do this
with more (un)natural stimuli. The occassional movie will be so far out
that by though some process of enchantment I can induce a faux-high.
Last night was the first time where I felt this sort of
conncertion/release-of-self was possible after having imbibed.
Typically I in some sense feel dulled. Not this Time! I'll have to
perfect my methodology...maybe I need to get kinda out of it and then
watch 200 Motels or Tetsuo: The Iron Man. I'll find something that
works. I really wanna experiance a Paul Krassner type LSD trip. Ya know
people's heads turning into rainbows and fun things like that. However
due to a strict moral code, I feel it is wrong to do illegal drugs
while they are illegal. Civil Disobediance and all that. Unfortunately
I don't think people will take to the streets in droves of protests
just so I can drop Acid. There is always Amsterdam. Just don't think of
David Bowie when you go there.<br><br>All right Peace out
