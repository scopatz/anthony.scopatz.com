It has now been two years.  Since I moved to Texas.  And Such.  This
represented a Pair-Of-Dig-'em Shift in my relationships so it is worth
mentioning.  With the temporary move to North Carolina, and the mass
exodus of the friend group here in Austin, It seems like this is as good
of a time as any to end this Loveless Era.

I talked to Jessie for the first time in like 4 years today.  It was
amazing.  It was so good to hear from her, and after so long.  Such
reunions don't normally fill me with such joy.  But she is special in
that way that I think that only Sean is special otherwise.  And that
slash that you ferkakte kids wrote about us in high school is patently
false.   Finding "those" people is hard.

It has also been two years since UCSB.  The Game; you just lost. 
C-C-Combo Breaker!

So in summary I feel a lot better about future prospects and past
veins.  All that is left is to find new women, and I think the Indian
waiter I had in Santa Fe said it best with "Put my sweet love in [their]
desert."

PS: she couldn't believe the nipple piercing or the short hair thing.
