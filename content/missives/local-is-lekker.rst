I just got back from my month-long visit to Cape Town.  As my friend and collaborator
John Xia put it this was my "vacation from [my] second job."  By this of course, 
he meant open source scientific software development.  Hopefully I didn't shirk my
duties too severely during this month off.  And if I know you from these communities
and you live in the Western Cape, I am sorry for not contacting you!  This was a
much needed recharge month. 

*So how was it?* 

**It was hands down, no fooling, rock solid, cross-my-heart brilliant!** 

Cape Town is a fascinating city and I believe that the people and attitudes are 
positively influenced by its geology and geography significantly more than in 
other, lesser cities.  Approximately 10% of the city by area (mostly in the west
and south) is occupied by Table Mountain National Park and another 10+% is in other
protected wilderness areas.  This is combined with a long and winding and stunning 
coastline and a Mediterranean climate.

This means that people who live 
`beyond the lentil curtain <http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20120807-cape-towns-lentil-curtain>`_ 
and in the False Bay (*Valsbaai*) area in the south are beautifully sandwiched 
in an region approximately 1 km thick.  Sea & sand on the one side, 1000+ meter 
peaks in `nature reserves <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nature_reserves_in_Cape_Town>`_ 
on the other side. In the course of three hours one can easily dry off from an 
afternoon of surfing by scrambling up to an overwhelming vista, fall back down 
the mountain, put on a swimsuit, and paddle around tide pools during sunset.

Such close and easy access to nature seems to have a deep effect on the culture. 
Imagine if you plopped a national park right in the 
middle of Los Angeles, which is the US city with the closest population size to Cape 
Town. Suddenly people might enjoy being outside, have a fundamental respect for 
nature, and nice beaches might not just be a pleasure afforded Malibu.  
I think that this is exemplified by `Slow Life <http://www.capetownmagazine.com/cafes/slow-life-caf-in-cape-town/93_22_19015>`_,
my favorite caf√© in Muizenberg, where the simple act of living is supposed to be
pleasurable.

Now don't get me wrong. South Africa still has major political and social issues
to work through.  However, it is fairly clear that the average citizen of the 
Western Cape has internalized `America's best idea <http://www.nps.gov/americasbestidea/>`_ 
far better than most Americans. This is highly commendable and I keep a good hope 
that it holds up to further industrialization and development.

In many ways I felt at home. It is socially acceptable to be vegan there in a way
I have seen rivaled only in Austin.  Linguistically, the Afrikaans and English mix 
in a way that is pleasingly reminiscent of the English-German-Yiddish pidgin that 
I speak with my family.  There is a metro light rail system that 
is good enough.  The distances between the tiny stads are very walkable.  You can 
hear the glorious waves crashing while you lie in bed, making it a suitable 
replacement for Santa Barbara.

However in some ways my Cape Town experience was better than home. 
Exhibit A: penguins in their natural habitat.  Nope, we don't have those in ye olde
Northern Hemisphere.

The wind itself, a proud force of nature, must be Exhibit B.  In Chicago, the 
wind is mostly artificial - caused by the many sky scrappers and thin streets - and
is occasionally enough to push you off your bicycle.  In False Bay, the wind is 
often enough to push you off your feet.  You can feel this on the beaches where
the sand rips your skin and see it in the mountains as the cloudy tablecloth flaps 
on a gargantuan scale.

I could continue to expound on the many virtues of Cape Town and my visit.
In the interest of time I'll fast forward to my last action-packed weekend.  
This was the one weekend where I rented a car and left the city.  The first stop 
on this trek was 
the `Vortex's "Open Source" 5-day trance party <http://www.intothevortex.co.za/%E2%99%A5-vortex-%E2%99%A5-sa-2013-%E2%99%A5-open-source-%E2%99%A5-5-9-december-2013/>`_.
With a name like Open Source how could I not go?  It was a bit like Flipside's 
sound camps but without the gift economy and less variety.  This made the festival
convenient if not communal.  Still South Africans are pro at these events. They have 
at least one a month, often in beautiful natural environments.
I was intermittently there for only two days because I decided to do 
my first ever bungee jump!

    `the highest and prettiest drop <http://www.faceadrenalin.com/>`_
    in the world?!

On the way back from listening to the same bass beat over and over again, 
I decided to take a 100 km detour to see the southern most point in Africa.
This has the distinguishing feature of being the divider between the Indian and
Atlantic oceans.  This makes it interesting because unlike other natural critical
points I have visited (ie mountain tops), this is a critical point for land, sea, 
and air simultaneously! This was just another pretty beach in the same way that 
a mountain peak is just another unmatchable vista.

Finally, no discussion of South Africa over the past month would be complete without
mention of Nelson Mandela's passing.  The reaction was touching, immediate, 
and sustained.  In all corners of life there were memorials, remembrances, and
commentaries.  Even at the trance festival there was a florescent finger paint 
cloth memorial sponsored by Greenpeace which anyone was free to add to. The memorials
were a good mix of mourning and celebratory remembrances.  The Onion put it well 
when they said that he became the `"first politician to be missed." <http://www.theonion.com/articles/nelson-mandela-becomes-first-politician-to-be-miss,34755/>`_

At one point my dad asked if I would visit the exhibition of the body and pay 
my respects as I had a car at the time.  I had to explain that I was not 
going because it would be at best 6 hours out of the way.  To which he responded, 
"Six hours? Six hours! The man was in prison for 26 years and you can't drive 
six hours!" Thanks dad...

As a US citizen, I found it quite surprising how much press President Obama and 
his visit was getting.  It often seemed as though radio broadcasts would favor 
President Obama speeches over President Zuma ones. Several South Africans mentioned 
to me the novelty of 
being in the same country at the same time as Obama. As Obama's former neighbor
on the south side of Chicago I thought this was pretty funny since I spent most 
of my time wishing Obama *wouldn't* come home.  It was always a huge traffic and 
security headache when he did.

All in all, I was very happy with my trip.  Ask me more about it sometime.  Cape
Town is undeniably special.
