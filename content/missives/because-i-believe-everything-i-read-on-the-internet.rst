and Google is always right!

Hate to break it to you, but some things in science are governed by
consensus, like `Climate Change`_.

That being said, the consensus online is that, in fact, `cats do
have`_\ `free will`_!

And a subject we failed to touch on is that cats act as an operator that
removes free will from humans.

And in case you wanted to know the `Jewish`_ and `Philosophical`_
answers. Which I am apt to agree with in fact (That pets don't have free
will as such because they don't have the moral capacity.)

However, all sources agree that higher order animals (`like cats`_) have
the capacity to make decisions (just not moral ones). Moreover, cats,
dogs, apes, monkeys, dolphins, rodents, ocelots, etc. certainly have an
emotional capacity. [They'd be pretty terrible pets if they didn't.]

So, maybe they don't have Free Will as such, but I would feel pretty
terrible about imprisoning a fellow being who has the capacity to make a
choice and feel the consequences of its decision.

**MORAL:** I am too much of a puto to own a pussy-cat here. Maybe I
should move to Los Gatos.

**MORAL 2:** FINE YOU WIN ~\_~.
