When I first arrived in Houston a week and a half ago, my boss called it
"the City that Oil built." I have experienced a strong correlation
between such liquid markets, the willingness for people to live in
underground tunnels, and the general lack of vegan options.

Downtown Houston is a weird place.  It never seems busy though one may
saunter through the avenues framed by monolithic buildings.
 The architecture is grandiose and diverse.  But you have to wonder who
lives in these constructs if you are the only one on the street.

During the day, the city is teeming with life.  Like white blood cells
they traverse the internal circulatory infrastructure.  Exiting the
anonymous hall's glassy dermis for any length of time must be death for
these oxygen-carrying modula.  Unless, of course, it is their smoke
break.

I wish the clockwork city didn't checkout at 6 pm.  I like the night
life, baby.
