So I am still in the closet and will be for the next couple of nights.

We got a lot of work done today, but as it turns out, the door still
needs to be finished and then put up and the grouter's are coming
tomorrow and the guest room won't be accessible until Tuesday. Which is
fine. We bought a mattress today and varnished the door and did a lot of
storage moving around and the like. But really, in life, isn't grout
more important.

Also I forgot. The standard fare of chix out here is California hot.
Maybe since it is where I grew up or there might a substantially greater
image self-conscious out here, but the difference is Stark (Winter is
Coming).

The funniest thing that happened today was by far this iPhone
advertisement I saw. It is a normal lame add, but at the end they go to
call someone (you just one of the feature of this so-called phone).
However, the person that is being called has alittle picture avatar of a
vaguely azn woman whose name is Anna Haro. With a name like that she
should go out and become one. I must say I didn't take Apple for
/b/tards.

The low point was either the Walmart electronics section -OR- Home Depot
-OR- being called "Tony" a couple hundred times.

The weather today says that Chicago and Santa Fe will be the same
temperature at 18 degrees. But at least in Santa Fe it is a dry cold.
