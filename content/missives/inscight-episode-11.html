<p>
On episode 11, we depart from our traditional episode format to cover NoSQL databases.  What differs about this episode is that we covered a panel discussion that took place at the first ever Austin NoSQL Meetup, right here in Enthought's headquarters!  In addition to hearing the aggregated wisdom of our very knowledgeable panelists, you'll also hear both questions and answers from the 20+ audience members at the meetup.
</p>

<p>
Be forewarned.  This episode represents a deep-cut of the material.  While there were some attempts to explain the subject at a high level, the heart of the issue was attacked head on and in full force.  A basic familiarity with traditional relational databases is assumed.  A cursory knowledge of the current NoSQL landscape would also be helpful. Lacking this understanding going in simply means that you have more to learn from the episode!
