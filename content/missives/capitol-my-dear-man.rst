So in my travels today I managed to hit three capitols.

Austin -> Washington DC -> Raleigh

Austin had the nicest airport. DC's was the most corporate and made me feel 
dirty and had the worst layout. Raleigh's was the oldest and most ghetto.

However, while I was walking to my hotel room I met a fellow who used to
live in Hyde Park and shopped at Wheatsville. Go Figure!

Most telling from this trip so far is that the taxi driver complained
about rampant hosing development from a recent influx of Californians.

The Economist's obituary for Aurthur C. Clarke was much nicer than the
one for Gary Gygax.
