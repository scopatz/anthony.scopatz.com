This blog represents every blog post I have ever made.  It is therefore cobbled 
together from at least four other blogs, not including guests posts.  As such, 
this goes *deep* into history and some of the earlier posts should likely
never be seen by mortal eyes.  Still, I have included them here for to satisfy
my penchant for completeness and as a part of my practice of radical openness. 
I have redacted only the portions which mentioned other people by name explicitly
and in a negative light.  If you would like for me to remove or redact a post, 
please let me know and I will do so.

Many of the early posts are ridiculous, terrible.  However, they do blossom into 
something insightful, beautiful. This is a personal blog.  Some of the entries
are quite personal. The following were initial sources for this website:

* `inSCIght <http://inscight.org/>`_, 2011 - 2013, Scientific Computing Podcast
* `Her Advocate <http://heradvocate.org/>`_, 2010 - 2012, 
* `The Tejas Chronicles <http://scopatz.livejournal.com/>`_, 2006 - 2009, 
  The 'scopatz' Live Journal, You probably do not want to go back this far.
* `Avilin <http://avilin.livejournal.com/>`_, 2004 - 2006, 
  The 'avilin' Live Journal, You *definitely* do not want to go back this far.
