What an awesome trip!  I had the pleasure of visiting
my brother Shane at his home in Tel Aviv for the past month.  Shane is currently
a dancer in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.batsheva.co.il/en/"&gt;Batsheva ensemble&lt;/a&gt;.  This makes
him famous - at least in Israel and insofar as &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; knows&amp;nbsp;Batsheva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I had a fantastic&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been holding off on going to Israel for a long time.  I had my misgivings,
I had never been before, I didn&amp;#8217;t go on Birthright, and I don&amp;#8217;t particularly enjoy
touristy activities. There are things in Israel I had always wanted to see - the
Heights, the Negev, Tel Aviv - but I knew that most tourists miss out on these gems
in favor of other outings - Jerusalem, the Dead Sea, Masada.  Luckily with my
brother, we were able to skip out on all of the stuff I did not want to do and we
were able to have a more tailored experience.  This was exactly want I&amp;nbsp;wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/keep-tlv-awesome/cafelix.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/keep-tlv-awesome/cafelix.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Deliciousness outside of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cafelix.de/"&gt;Cafelix&lt;/a&gt;,
the coffee place I ended up basically living at during the&amp;nbsp;weekdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since both Shane and I were working the whole time, the weeks were structured
such that we would work Sunday through Thursday.  Friday morning we would leave for
somewhere fun and return Saturday&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something truly beautiful about this schedule. It places shabbat dinner
right at the center of importance. Since people generally have Friday off of work (or
as a half-day in the morning) this gives everyone time to prepare to spend an evening
with friends &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; family - even if they are secular!  Saturday during the day is quite
relaxed giving one time to recover from the previous night&amp;#8217;s feast. Then just as you
start to get antsy the world comes alive again on Saturday night. This feels so much
more right than the diurnal sabbath tradition in the West.  In the U.S., I am often
annoyed when a city isn&amp;#8217;t awake until 11 pm everyday.  In Israel, I barely noticed that
almost everything was closed for a day and a half every&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="my-other-homeland"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Other&amp;nbsp;Homeland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a cunning similarity between Israel and the best country in the Union: Texas.
I am sure I am not the first person to note this.  For me
the comparison clearest along ecological, geological, and cultural axes. And what
Austin is to Texas, Tel Aviv is most certainly to Israel. Needless to say, I felt very
at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel is neatly divided into swampish hill country in the north and the desert
in the south.  Sound familiar?  On my first weekend, we traveled to the north and
stayed with Shane&amp;#8217;s friend and fellow Batsheva dancer Ayelet and her family.
They live in a
tiny village about 3 km from the border with Lebanon.  The terrain here was hilly
with peaks between 100 - 300 m and the flora was mostly low-lying oaken forest.
On Saturday morning we went for a beautiful hike down one of the canyons.  The
resemblance to Lost Maples or Pedernales is uncanny.  A beauty matched is no less&amp;nbsp;beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Shane near the top of the&amp;nbsp;canyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Ayelet and me near a&amp;nbsp;stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geologically, Israel is also similar to Texas in certain ways.  They both were
under the ocean for a very long time. The earth in these places has the same tenor:
gradually slopping hillsides, sandstone, and fossils coming from pushed up sediment.
This landscape gives rise to some of the most vibrant sunsets I have ever&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/keep-tlv-awesome/negev-sunset.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/keep-tlv-awesome/negev-sunset.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/strong&gt; The Negev at&amp;nbsp;sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The is very little light pollution in this area due to Mediterranean not being so
far away (in absolute terms) and the aridness leading to low population density.
Figure 4 was taken
in Mitzpe Ramon on my second full weekend in Israel.  We stayed at a place called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hostels-israel.com/hostels/silent-arrow-desert-lodge/"&gt;Silent Arrow&lt;/a&gt;,
which is a tent and hut hostel-ish place.  Silent Arrow is holistic without being hokey.
If anything it reminded me of a permanent version of a burn event camp.  What
is not to like?  I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend this&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/keep-tlv-awesome/makhtesh-ramon.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/keep-tlv-awesome/makhtesh-ramon.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Everybody loves Makhtesh&amp;nbsp;Ramon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our hike that weekend, we went down into the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhtesh_Ramon"&gt;Makhtesh Ramon&lt;/a&gt;.
This is jaw-dropping. There are no words in English to describe it.  Seriously.  The
word &amp;#8216;makhtesh&amp;#8217; doesn&amp;#8217;t have an English equivalent. It can be loosely translated as
&amp;#8216;crater&amp;#8217; but that is not quite right since such it structures are not formed by
meteor impacts. Texas, in all its vastness, does not have anything quite like&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culturally - from what I can infer - Israelis are about as home proud as Texans. My
main metric for this is the number of state flags per capita that you see in public.
Do car lots need hundres of flags wagging out in their wares? Does every other hook
on every wall need a string of flags (as if you could forget where you were)?
Is a lone star enough to symbolize your communal greatness?  Yes, yes,&amp;nbsp;yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/keep-tlv-awesome/texas-israeli-flags.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/keep-tlv-awesome/texas-israeli-flags.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Seen basically&amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the propensity for showing the standard is one of the most misunderstood
and misinterpreted things about Texas. It shows a gladness in the identity.
I don&amp;#8217;t think that it is arrogance as it is often thought to be (especially by
outsiders).  You don&amp;#8217;t need to think that you are better than others to be happy
in who you are.  Moreover, if you are happy with who you are you should be happy
to show&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics aside, one of the things that makes
Texas great is that Texans are generally happy to be Texans.  I can&amp;#8217;t say the same
about California, where culturally they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; think that they are better than others
while simultaneously only very few people are particularly proud to be Californian.
Israel shares this particular Texan idiosyncrasy. I think that there is a lot of value
in being home&amp;nbsp;proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you think that it is unfair to put politics aside here, it
is important to note that every place has its own deep, unresolved issues. Texas,
California, and Israel all live in seemingly infinite and inextricable quagmires.
Through these divisions, some places still manage to be happy with themselves.
I am not going to get into the business of comparing human suffering in this post.
However, I bet that if one were to compare atrocities committed by these three states
Israel would come out with the cleanest record. Not that this justifies it in anyway!
This is simply to state that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.A.&lt;/span&gt; does not have moral superiority and any belief
to that effect is historically&amp;nbsp;false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="can-i-buy-a-vowel"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I Buy A&amp;nbsp;Vowel?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So other than the Texas connection, what makes Israel a great place to&amp;nbsp;be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the top of my personal list is the accidental veganism. The Israeli diet is a
Mediterranean one. Tahini is the staple.  It is the glue that holds all meals together.
Followed by hummus, cauliflower, beet root (selek), and salads it is extraordinarily
easy to be vegetarian without ever intending to be. Since these core foodstuffs are
all vegetables. You actually have to go a bit out of your way to get milk or egg
products. Fish and meat is even farther afield. This is not to say that there are
millions of ideological vegans walking around; there aren&amp;#8217;t. Rather, the incidence
of not eating in a vegan or vegetarian fashion is much lower than in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; or Europe
where is often seems that it a meal is not considered proper if there isn&amp;#8217;t meat
involved. The engineer in me is elated to see this.  Widespread accidental veganism
is much preferred over ubiquitous and antagonistic&amp;nbsp;carnivorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/keep-tlv-awesome/kiosk.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/keep-tlv-awesome/kiosk.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7:&lt;/strong&gt; Enjoying an afternoon coffee at Tel Aviv&amp;#8217;s first &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; oldest
retail&amp;nbsp;building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating habits aren&amp;#8217;t the only thing that Israelis seem to do right &amp;#8216;accidentally.&amp;#8217;
I didn&amp;#8217;t see a single household that had a clothes dryer while I was there.  Everyone
hangs up their laundry to dry.  Also, every hot water heater is on its own switch and
some are even on timers.  If you want hot water for your shower, you need to turn the
switch one 20 minutes before hand.  If this sounds annoying, it is!  But I bet it is
much more energy efficient than simply leaving it on all the time.  These two things
alone I am a sure lower the per capita carbon footprint by a&amp;nbsp;ton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the public transportation system is pretty good.  Inside of the cities
it is mostly buses.  Between cities there are charter buses and a rail system.
The rail system is great and is widely used - unlike Amtrak.  Still, inside of Tel
Aviv it is generally easiest to walk or ride a bike.  The roads
were not made for&amp;nbsp;cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brilliant city planners designed a North-South
corridor parallel to the coast.  Many small neighborhoods exist along this where
one-way streets make it clear that if you don&amp;#8217;t know where you are driving then
you probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t be there.  I much prefer this over the monolithic grid
structure of Chicago.  It feels more like you belong in the place that you&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shane and I took an excellent Bauhaus walking tour which explained a lot of the
layout of the city in addition to the propensity for asymmetric buildings and
balconies.  Because &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1096"&gt;Tel Aviv is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNESCO&lt;/span&gt; world heritage site&lt;/a&gt;
for its Bauhaus collection, the city has a height limit of five storeys in certain
areas.  Again, this serves to make the place more neighborly.  Bauhaus put a lot of
emphasis on social engagement.  The focus was on street-facing balconies that were
comfortable and close enough to the ground to have conversations with your neighbors
and passers-by on the sidewalk.  This led to the absolute best Freudian slip of the
entire trip.  The tour guide was explaining that in Bauhaus, the kitchens were
often minimal and functional because &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;You are supposed to sit in the living
room and be social-ist with your&amp;nbsp;friends!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/keep-tlv-awesome/anniv.gif" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/keep-tlv-awesome/anniv.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8:&lt;/strong&gt; Shane and I sitting in the living room being social-ist for our
parents&amp;nbsp;anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I have to mention that while the Hebrew was disorienting at first I gradually
became more and more used to it. I could fairly easily follow simple conversations.
What was maddening, however, was that if you asked me to translate them I couldn&amp;#8217;t.
I knew what happened, I knew what it meant, but not what was said.  This got better
over time as words came back to me and I started being able to have simple conversations
myself. I blame this on learning and forgetting Hebrew so early in life. Everything
sounded right and sublime but I was able to communicate less well than when I was
in 2nd grade.  I am fairly confident that if I spent some serious time there, I would
really end up learning Hebrew&amp;nbsp;(again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="yalla-let-s-bounce"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yalla, Let&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Bounce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about a million things I didn&amp;#8217;t cover and about a million more that I want
to.  For example, Tel Aviv has absolutely amazing street art.  I&amp;#8217;ll leave you with
one of the my favorite reminder mantras that is painted throughout the city, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t
forget to be&amp;nbsp;awesome!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;

for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyne/pyne/blob/staging/docs/devsguide/style_guide.rst"&gt;a new style guide&lt;/a&gt;
I wrote.  Writing this went against every bone in my body. You are supposed to use
existing style guides. You are supposed to trust that the authors of other style
guides know what they are doing. Or barring their competence, that they are at least
consistent.  These assumptions work great as long&amp;nbsp;as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;such a style guide exists,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you live in only one&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyNE provides first class APIs in three languages (C++, Python, &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Cython) with
more to come, in all likelihood. Other projects rely on pyne&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; in all languages
and users see pyne from all levels.  We are not allowed to hide behind bad design
because it is &amp;#8216;just an optimization&amp;#8217; or it is for pyne developers only.  We need pyne
to be nice&amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No single style guide I have found really covers the multi-language scenario.
Sure, CPython has &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP7&lt;/span&gt; as a corollary to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt;, but it falls under the not-for-users
category. Many projects use different style guides for different languages saying, for
example, &amp;#8220;use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt; for Python and the Google C++ Style Guide for C++.&amp;#8221;  However,
the results of this are weird. Different guides make different assumptions about
fundamental abstractions: how are types names, how should memory be managed, and
so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Cython, no style guide actually existed and folks just do
something &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt;-ish.  This really isn&amp;#8217;t enough.  I hope that this is a stepping stone
for a more formal guide for Cython&amp;nbsp;eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pyne style guide, I tried to bring consistency across the language
barriers while remaining idiomatic to the individual languages.  I also tried to
rely on existing style guides, deferring to or forking from them as needed. I also
tried to tie together the languages with some head matter that I hope puts the reader
in the pyne mindset and is good advice no matter what language you are coding&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have included the style guide here in its current form.  Some of it is a bit
nuclear engineering specific.&amp;nbsp;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="rules-to-write-by"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules to Write&amp;nbsp;By&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to refer to things and concepts by their most specific name.
When writing PyNE code or documentation please use technical terms appropriately.
The following rules help provide needed&amp;nbsp;clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="terminology"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Terminology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The terms &lt;em&gt;element&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;elemental&lt;/em&gt; refer specifically to chemical elements,
oxygen, uranium, etc.  Use &lt;em&gt;element&lt;/em&gt; only when the physics relies on manipulating
elements and not their underlying isotopes (ie aqueous&amp;nbsp;reprocessing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;isotope&lt;/em&gt; refers only to a collection of nuclides containing the
same Z-number.  &lt;strong&gt;Do not confuse this with&amp;nbsp;*nuclide*!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;isotone&lt;/em&gt; refers only to a collection of nuclides containing the
same neutron&amp;nbsp;number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;isobar&lt;/em&gt; refers only to a collection of nuclides containing the
same&amp;nbsp;A-number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;isomer&lt;/em&gt; refers only to a collection of nuclides containing the
same A-number and the same Z-number but possessing differing internal energy&amp;nbsp;states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The term &lt;em&gt;nuclide&lt;/em&gt; may refer to any species with a nucleus. This is the most
general term and encompasses isotopes, isotones, isobars, and&amp;nbsp;isomers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="interfaces"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interfaces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always provide&amp;nbsp;units!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use square-brace notation to mark units in text, ie&amp;nbsp;[sec].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User-facing APIs should be as generic and robust as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuclear data belongs in&amp;nbsp;nuc_data.h5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Views belong in the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;gui&lt;/tt&gt; sub-package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests belong in the top-level &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;tests&lt;/tt&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation belongs in the top-level &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;docs&lt;/tt&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The capitalized project name is &amp;#8220;PyNE&amp;#8221; while the lowercase project name is&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;pyne&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write code in whatever language you want but make sure that it is exposed to Python.
Python is the glue that holds the universe together. It is the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and the
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;INT_MAX&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="variable-name-conventions"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Variable Name&amp;nbsp;Conventions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please use the following patterns when writing pyne code. These rules should
only be ignored if they would cause name conflicts. These variable names are
considered to have the same semantic meaning throughout the entire code&amp;nbsp;base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;xs&lt;/tt&gt; stands for &amp;#8220;cross&amp;nbsp;section&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;rx&lt;/tt&gt; stands for&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;reaction&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ve&lt;/tt&gt; stands for &amp;#8220;volume&amp;nbsp;element&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;nuc&lt;/tt&gt; stands for a &amp;#8220;nuclide&amp;#8221; in id&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;nuc_name&lt;/tt&gt; stands for a &amp;#8220;nuclide&amp;#8221; in a string&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;iso&lt;/tt&gt; stands for an &amp;#8220;isotope&amp;#8221; in id&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;iso_name&lt;/tt&gt; stands for an &amp;#8220;isotope&amp;#8221; in string&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;mat&lt;/tt&gt; stands for&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;material&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;m&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;mesh&lt;/tt&gt; are used for Mesh&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;idx&lt;/tt&gt; stands for &amp;#8220;indices&amp;#8221;. When used with meshes it is the canonical integer
identifier for an entity. This is not necessarily iteration&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; is the iteration variable of mesh indices, ie &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;for i in idx&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generator names should start with the prefix &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;iter&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="canonical-forms"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Canonical&amp;nbsp;Forms&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;We have canonical forms; use them! For example, if a function accepts a nuclide
as an argument then you should use nucname to ensure that it accepts all possible
nuclide name spellings. If a function accepts a reaction name then use the rxname
module. Turn materials specifications into Material objects.  And so&amp;nbsp;on&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Mesh is the gentle giant of canonical forms. Use its strong, kind arms when dealing
with&amp;nbsp;geometries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;If a canonical form doesn&amp;#8217;t exist, follow these&amp;nbsp;steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;invent one,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it&amp;nbsp;awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Making a canonical form great may take time and many iterations. Do not give&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;Interim working solutions are better than the best solution&amp;nbsp;never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDF5&lt;/span&gt; is the preferred persistence format for structured&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="expectations"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code must have associated tests and adequate&amp;nbsp;documentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; exceptions to not having tests and documentation are when merging in and
slowly integrating legacy code or code not originally originally written for&amp;nbsp;pyne.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without both tests and documentation, the code must be marked as&amp;nbsp;experimental.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; empathy for your&amp;nbsp;users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be selfish. Since you will be writing tests you will be your first&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing says &amp;#8220;I &amp;lt;3 PyNE&amp;#8221; quite like an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; art&amp;nbsp;dragon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="python-style-guide"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Python Style&amp;nbsp;Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyNE uses &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for all Python code.  The following rules apply where &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is open to&amp;nbsp;interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use absolute imports (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;import pyne.material&lt;/tt&gt;) rather than explicit relative imports
(&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;import .material&lt;/tt&gt;). Implicit relative imports (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;import material&lt;/tt&gt;) are never&amp;nbsp;allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &amp;#8216;single quotes&amp;#8217; for string literals, and &amp;#8220;&amp;#8221;&amp;#8220;triple double quotes&amp;#8221;&amp;#8220;&amp;#8221; for
docstrings. Double quotes are allowed to prevent single quote escaping,
e.g. &amp;#8220;Y&amp;#8217;all c&amp;#8217;mon o&amp;#8217;er&amp;nbsp;here!&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use sphinx with the numpydoc extension to autogenerate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; documentation. Follow
the numpydoc standard for docstrings &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt"&gt;described here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple functions should have simple&amp;nbsp;docstrings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lines should be at most 80 characters long. The 72 and 79 character recommendations
from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt; are not required&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All Python code should be compliant with Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+.  At some
unforeseen date in the future, Python 2.7 support &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be&amp;nbsp;dropped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tests should be written with nose using a procedural style. Do not use unittest
directly or write tests in an object-oriented&amp;nbsp;style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test generators make more dots and the dots must&amp;nbsp;flow!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cython-style-guide"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cython Style&amp;nbsp;Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cython as a super-set language of Python should follow &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for all syntax
that the two languages share.  Cython-specific syntax should follow these additional&amp;nbsp;rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cdefs-cpdefs-ctypedefs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;cdefs, cpdefs, &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;ctypedefs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cdef&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cpdef&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ctypedef&lt;/tt&gt; statements from the following type by
exactly one space. In turn, separate the type from the variable name by exactly
one space. Only &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;ctypedef&lt;/tt&gt; one variable per line. You may &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cdef&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cpdef&lt;/tt&gt;
multiple variables per line as long as these are simple declarations - multiple
assignment, references, or pointers are not allowed. Grouping &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cdef&lt;/tt&gt; statements
is allowed.  For&amp;nbsp;example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;* &lt;span class="nf"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cpdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;true_enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Bad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *&lt;span class="nf"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class="nf"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class="nf"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class="nf"&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class="nf"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class="nf"&gt;mat&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Material&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="nf"&gt;falsified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside of a function, place all &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cdef&lt;/tt&gt; statements at the top of the function&amp;nbsp;body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;true_enough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;rtn&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;rtn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rtn&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Bad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;falsified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;rtn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rtn&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cimport-include-statements"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;cimport &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; include&amp;nbsp;statements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cimports&lt;/tt&gt; should follow the same rules defined in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; statements.  If a module is both imported and cimported, the
cimport should come before the&amp;nbsp;import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not use &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;include&lt;/tt&gt; statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="error-return-values"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Error return&amp;nbsp;values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When declaring an error return value with the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;except&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, use one
space on both sides of the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;except&lt;/tt&gt;. If in a function definition, there should
be no spaces between the error return value and the colon &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;.  Avoid &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;except *&lt;/tt&gt;
unless it is needed for functions returning &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;void&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;redwood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sequoia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Bad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class="nf"&gt;spruce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pointers-references"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pointers &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;References&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pointers and references may be either zero or one space away from the type name.
If followed by a variable name, they must be one space away from the variable name.
Do not put any spaces between the reference operator &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/tt&gt; and the variable&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class="nf"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Bad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; *&lt;span class="nf"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="casting"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Casting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When casting a variable there must be no whitespace between the opening &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt; and
the type.  There must one space between the closing &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and the&amp;nbsp;variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Bad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="loops"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Loops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use Python loop syntax - &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;for i in range(10):&lt;/tt&gt;.  Other for-loop constructs are
deprecated and must be&amp;nbsp;avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="property-keyword"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Property&amp;nbsp;Keyword&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properties are great! There should be exactly one space between the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;property&lt;/tt&gt;
keyword and the attribute name.  There may be no spaces between the attribute
name and the colon &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;.  All properties should have docstrings. There should
be no blank lines between the property declaration line and the following&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;has_cone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;This class has a cone.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__get__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Bad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;property&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;has_cone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__get__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="type-declarations-extern-public-api-readonly"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Type Declarations, Extern, Public, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Readonly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type declarations, the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;extern&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;public&lt;/tt&gt; keyword, the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;api&lt;/tt&gt;
keyword, and the &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;readonly&lt;/tt&gt; keyword should always be followed by a single&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class="nf"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;sequoia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Bad&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; * &lt;span class="nf"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;cdef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kr"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="kr"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="nf"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;spruce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="documentation"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to following the numpydoc convention, also include the function or method
signature as the first line in the docstring.  This helps sphinx print out the
signature.  Include type information in this signature if available and&amp;nbsp;relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="c-c-style-guide"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;C/C++ Style&amp;nbsp;Guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As software that is meant to be exposed to Python, C/C++ code written for pyne
has special needs.  Existing single-language style guides are non-idiomatic across
the language barrier.  This style guide attempts to rectify this impedance
mismatch by defining a hierarchy of style guides and special rules to follow that
make C/C++ more PyNEthonic. Legacy codes not originally written for pyne in these
languages need not be migrated to this style.  While a custom style may not be
ideal in terms of leveraging linters and style checker tools, the benefits
in readability and portability outweigh this&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim is to have all languages be as similar and have as idiomatic of APIs for that
language as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except as noted below, C/C++ code should adhere to the rules laid out in the
following style guides in order of&amp;nbsp;preference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEP8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.maultech.com/chrislott/resources/cstyle/LinuxKernelCodingStyle.txt"&gt;The Linux Kernel Coding&amp;nbsp;Style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml"&gt;The Google C++ Style&amp;nbsp;Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section was forked from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.ros.org/CppStyleGuide"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROS&lt;/span&gt; C++ Style Guide&lt;/a&gt;.
If you require clarification on a particular syntax or idiom, please&amp;nbsp;ask!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="files"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files may have&amp;nbsp;under_scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C source files have the extension &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.c&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++ source files have the extension &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.cpp&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Header files have the extension &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.h&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the file primarily implements a class, name the file after the&amp;nbsp;class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="classes-typedefs-structs"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Classes, Typedefs, &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Structs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class names are&amp;nbsp;CapCased:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;ExampleClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exception:&lt;/strong&gt; if the class name contains a short acronym, the acronym itself
should be all&amp;nbsp;capitals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;HokuyoURGLaser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name the class after what it is. If you can&amp;#8217;t think of what it is, perhaps you
have not thought through the design well&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class names should be&amp;nbsp;nouns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typedef names should be lowercase_with_underscores, like primitive C/C++ and
Python&amp;nbsp;types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Struct names should be CapCased if they have non-trivial member functions
and are more&amp;nbsp;class-like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if a struct is meant to be used primarily as compound data type
it should have a lowercase_with_underscores name, like&amp;nbsp;typedefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="functions"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Functions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions and their arguments are&amp;nbsp;lowercase_with_underscores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;example_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;example_arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions usually performs an action, so the name should make clear what it does.
Function names thus should be&amp;nbsp;verbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="variables"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variable names are&amp;nbsp;lowercase_with_underscores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integral iterator variables can be very short, such as i, j, k. Be consistent in
how you use iterators (e.g., i on the outer loop, j on the next inner&amp;nbsp;loop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STL&lt;/span&gt; iterator variables should indicate what they are iterating&amp;nbsp;over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pid_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pid_it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="constants"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Constants&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constants, wherever they are used, are&amp;nbsp;ALL_CAPITALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="member-variables"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Member&amp;nbsp;Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variables that are members of a class are lowercase_with_underscores.
Private and protected member variables start with a single leading underscore.
Public member variables do not have a leading&amp;nbsp;underscore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;public_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_protected_y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_private_z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="global-variables"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Global&amp;nbsp;Variables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global variables should never be&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exception:&lt;/strong&gt; a file may contain a main()&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="namespaces"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Namespaces&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namespace names, like Python module names, are lowercase &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;underscores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything should be in a namespace.  Anonymous namespaces are encouraged to help
meet this&amp;nbsp;requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bodies of namespace declaration and definition are not indented. This is
the same as the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCSG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never use a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;using namespace&lt;/tt&gt; directive. Using-declarations inside of class
or function scope, which only grab the names you intend to use, are&amp;nbsp;allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Good&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// I want to refer to std::list as list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// I want to refer to std::vector as vector&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Bad, because it imports all names from std::&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="access-patterns"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Access&amp;nbsp;Patterns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all adults here. Everything should be public.  Use private and protected
variables only when absolutely&amp;nbsp;necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="accessors-mutator-pattern"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accessors/Mutator&amp;nbsp;Pattern&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid getter and setter member functions. This pattern increases code volume,
inlining is not guaranteed, and slows down run&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this pattern only if implementing a Python/Cython-like property where
getting or setting a member variable is non-trivial. In these cases, the
storage variable should be named with a leading underscore (even though it may be
public) and the get/set names should have the same name as the variable but without
the leading&amp;nbsp;underscore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;WithAnX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="nl"&gt;public:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// storage variable&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// getter&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// setter&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="formatting"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Formatting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indent each block by 2 spaces. Never insert literal tab&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of a namespace are not&amp;nbsp;indented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all friends here! Braces should be &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gskinner.com/blog/archives/2008/11/curly_braces_to.html"&gt;cuddled&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braces may be omitted if the enclosed block is a single-line&amp;nbsp;statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only single line comments should be used.  Multi-line comments are inconsistent
and not&amp;nbsp;allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* This is not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; */&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/* What is even going on here?!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt; * All I can see are the stars...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt; */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="line-length"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Line&amp;nbsp;Length&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximum line length is 80&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="include-guards"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Include&amp;nbsp;Guards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All headers must be protected against multiple inclusion by #ifndef guards.
These guards ought to be&amp;nbsp;UUIDs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#ifndef _W7WGLJVRGRDH7G47RDHRLLCP2A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define _W7WGLJVRGRDH7G47RDHRLLCP2A&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this command for generating&amp;nbsp;UUIDs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;python -c &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;import uuid; import base64; print(&amp;#39;_&amp;#39; + base64.b32encode(uuid.uuid4().bytes).decode().strip(&amp;#39;=&amp;#39;))&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guard should begin before any other code and should end at the end of the&amp;nbsp;file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code must be documented. We use doxygen to auto-document our code.
All functions, methods, classes, variables, enumerations, and constants
should be&amp;nbsp;documented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="console-output"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Console&amp;nbsp;Output&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid printf if in C++.  Use &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;std::cout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="macros"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Macros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid preprocessor macros whenever possible. Unlike in-line functions and const
variables, macros are neither typed nor&amp;nbsp;scoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="inheritance"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inheritance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When overriding a virtual method in a subclass always declare it to be virtual
so that the reader knows what&amp;#8217;s going&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="exceptions"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exceptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built-in exceptions are the preferred error-reporting mechanism,
as opposed to returning integer error codes or custom exception&amp;nbsp;mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not throw exceptions from&amp;nbsp;destructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not throw exceptions from callbacks that you don&amp;#8217;t invoke&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="calling-exit"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calling&amp;nbsp;exit()&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only call &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;exit()&lt;/tt&gt; at a well-defined exit point for the&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never call &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;exit()&lt;/tt&gt; in a&amp;nbsp;library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="portability"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Portability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portability&amp;nbsp;counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not use uint as a type. Instead use unsigned&amp;nbsp;int.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;isnan()&lt;/tt&gt; from within the std namespace, i.e.: &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;std::isnan()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

As my friend and collaborator
John Xia put it this was my &amp;#8220;vacation from [my] second job.&amp;#8221;  By this of course,
he meant open source scientific software development.  Hopefully I didn&amp;#8217;t shirk my
duties too severely during this month off.  And if I know you from these communities
and you live in the Western Cape, I am sorry for not contacting you!  This was a
much needed recharge&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So how was&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was hands down, no fooling, rock solid, cross-my-heart&amp;nbsp;brilliant!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cape Town is a fascinating city and I believe that the people and attitudes are
positively influenced by its geology and geography significantly more than in
other, lesser cities.  Approximately 10% of the city by area (mostly in the west
and south) is occupied by Table Mountain National Park and another 10+% is in other
protected wilderness areas.  This is combined with a long and winding and stunning
coastline and a Mediterranean&amp;nbsp;climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/local-is-lekker/cape-peninsula.gif" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/local-is-lekker/cape-peninsula.gif" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt; View of the Cape Town and its parks.  I was mostly in&amp;nbsp;Muizenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that people who live
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20120807-cape-towns-lentil-curtain"&gt;beyond the lentil curtain&lt;/a&gt;
and in the False Bay (&lt;em&gt;Valsbaai&lt;/em&gt;) area in the south are beautifully sandwiched
in an region approximately 1 km thick.  Sea &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sand on the one side, 1000+ meter
peaks in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nature_reserves_in_Cape_Town"&gt;nature reserves&lt;/a&gt;
on the other side. In the course of three hours one can easily dry off from an
afternoon of surfing by scrambling up to an overwhelming vista, fall back down
the mountain, put on a swimsuit, and paddle around tide pools during&amp;nbsp;sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

and the beach. The mountains from the other side of False Bay can be seen in
the&amp;nbsp;distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such close and easy access to nature seems to have a deep effect on the culture.
Imagine if you plopped a national park right in the
middle of Los Angeles, which is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; city with the closest population size to Cape
Town. Suddenly people might enjoy being outside, have a fundamental respect for
nature, and nice beaches might not just be a pleasure afforded Malibu.
I think that this is exemplified by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.capetownmagazine.com/cafes/slow-life-caf-in-cape-town/93_22_19015"&gt;Slow Life&lt;/a&gt;,
my favorite cafÃ© in Muizenberg, where the simple act of living is supposed to be&amp;nbsp;pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/local-is-lekker/slow-life.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/local-is-lekker/slow-life.jpg" /&gt;

at Slow&amp;nbsp;Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong. South Africa still has major political and social issues
to work through.  However, it is fairly clear that the average citizen of the
Western Cape has internalized &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.nps.gov/americasbestidea/"&gt;America&amp;#8217;s best idea&lt;/a&gt;
far better than most Americans. This is highly commendable and I keep a good hope
that it holds up to further industrialization and&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways I felt at home. It is socially acceptable to be vegan there in a way
I have seen rivaled only in Austin.  Linguistically, the Afrikaans and English mix
in a way that is pleasingly reminiscent of the English-German-Yiddish pidgin that
I speak with my family.  There is a metro light rail system that
is good enough.  The distances between the tiny stads are very walkable.  You can
hear the glorious waves crashing while you lie in bed, making it a suitable
replacement for Santa&amp;nbsp;Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However in some ways my Cape Town experience was better than home.
Exhibit A: penguins in their natural habitat.  Nope, we don&amp;#8217;t have those in ye olde
Northern&amp;nbsp;Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/local-is-lekker/penguins.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/local-is-lekker/penguins.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exhibit A:&lt;/strong&gt; Penguins at Boulders&amp;nbsp;Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wind itself, a proud force of nature, must be Exhibit B.  In Chicago, the
wind is mostly artificial - caused by the many sky scrappers and thin streets - and
is occasionally enough to push you off your bicycle.  In False Bay, the wind is
often enough to push you off your feet.  You can feel this on the beaches where
the sand rips your skin and see it in the mountains as the cloudy tablecloth flaps
on a gargantuan&amp;nbsp;scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Life ought to have a little white ghost town shiver now and&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could continue to expound on the many virtues of Cape Town and my visit.
In the interest of time I&amp;#8217;ll fast forward to my last action-packed weekend.
This was the one weekend where I rented a car and left the city.  The first stop
on this trek was
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.intothevortex.co.za/%E2%99%A5-vortex-%E2%99%A5-sa-2013-%E2%99%A5-open-source-%E2%99%A5-5-9-december-2013/"&gt;Vortex&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Open Source&amp;#8221; 5-day trance party&lt;/a&gt;.
With a name like Open Source how could I not go?  It was a bit like Flipside&amp;#8217;s
sound camps but without the gift economy and less variety.  This made the festival
convenient if not communal.  Still South Africans are pro at these events. They have
at least one a month, often in beautiful natural environments.
I was intermittently there for only two days because I decided to do
my first ever bungee&amp;nbsp;jump!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/local-is-lekker/bungee.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/local-is-lekker/bungee.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Since I was going to bungee jump, why not do it from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.faceadrenalin.com/"&gt;the highest and prettiest drop&lt;/a&gt;
in the&amp;nbsp;world?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the way back from listening to the same bass beat over and over again,
I decided to take a 100 km detour to see the southern most point in Africa.
This has the distinguishing feature of being the divider between the Indian and
Atlantic oceans.  This makes it interesting because unlike other natural critical
points I have visited (ie mountain tops), this is a critical point for land, sea,
and air simultaneously! This was just another pretty beach in the same way that
a mountain peak is just another unmatchable&amp;nbsp;vista.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, no discussion of South Africa over the past month would be complete without
mention of Nelson Mandela&amp;#8217;s passing.  The reaction was touching, immediate,
and sustained.  In all corners of life there were memorials, remembrances, and
commentaries.  Even at the trance festival there was a florescent finger paint
cloth memorial sponsored by Greenpeace which anyone was free to add to. The memorials
were a good mix of mourning and celebratory remembrances.  The Onion put it well
when they said that he became the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/nelson-mandela-becomes-first-politician-to-be-miss,34755/"&gt;&amp;#8220;first politician to be&amp;nbsp;missed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="|filename|../images/local-is-lekker/mandela.jpg" src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/local-is-lekker/mandela.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5:&lt;/strong&gt; I lit a candle or two at the Madela shrine in Slow&amp;nbsp;Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point my dad asked if I would visit the exhibition of the body and pay
my respects as I had a car at the time.  I had to explain that I was not
going because it would be at best 6 hours out of the way.  To which he responded,
&amp;#8220;Six hours? Six hours! The man was in prison for 26 years and you can&amp;#8217;t drive
six hours!&amp;#8221; Thanks&amp;nbsp;dad&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; citizen, I found it quite surprising how much press President Obama and
his visit was getting.  It often seemed as though radio broadcasts would favor
President Obama speeches over President Zuma ones. Several South Africans mentioned
to me the novelty of
being in the same country at the same time as Obama. As Obama&amp;#8217;s former neighbor
on the south side of Chicago I thought this was pretty funny since I spent most
of my time wishing Obama &lt;em&gt;wouldn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; come home.  It was always a huge traffic and
security headache when he&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I was very happy with my trip.  Ask me more about it sometime.  Cape
Town is undeniably&amp;nbsp;special.&lt;/p&gt;

choice to become vegan, the philosophical justifications for being vegan, and of
course delicious vegan food. There are many reasons to be vegan and it seems to be
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism#Philosophy:_ethical_and_environmental_perspectives"&gt;an idealogical past time&lt;/a&gt;
to debate their relative&amp;nbsp;merits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I realized over the course of these discussions is that I do not seem to
care precisely why I am&amp;nbsp;vegan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree and comply with all of the standard
justifications as well as having an individual credo which extends beyond this.
For argument&amp;#8217;s sake, I&amp;#8217;ll often choose a position when forced. Still I feel that
doing so is a manufactured way of having a dialog. That I am vegan is&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a practical sense, that one acts in a vegan manner ought to be enough for any other
other vegan.  Forsooth, often times it is not and vegans typically request that
their fellows are vegan for exactly the same reason they themselves are vegan.
Why we all cannot just get along is a question for the&amp;nbsp;sociologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three, largely independent arguments that are used to justify vegan acts:
&lt;strong&gt;anti-suffering&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;environmental&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;personal purity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How important is a belief in each of these? Is it valuable to believe in all of
them or is a belief in one equivalent to believing in more than one? Given a
metric to jointly weigh these three arguments, how important are external&amp;nbsp;arguments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I posit that since all arguments are&amp;nbsp;independent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;belief in one does not preclude a belief in any&amp;nbsp;other,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the arguments cannot be ranked,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a belief in more is better than belief in fewer as it diminishes the
likelihood of accidental infractions of&amp;nbsp;veganism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a short discussion of the main arguments for veganism in light of
these&amp;nbsp;suppositions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="minimization-of-suffering"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Minimization of&amp;nbsp;Suffering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This position is often called &amp;#8220;ethical veganism.&amp;#8221;  I dislike this term because it
implies that other reasons for being vegan are somehow less ethical, less
justified, or less meaningful.  That said, the tenet of minimal suffering is the
correct way to phrase this&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we were instead to justify the hedonistic inverse - the maximization of
pleasure. Arguably, the more capacity for intelligence a being has the greater its
potential to feel pleasure. In such a system, it would be allowable to cause pain
and suffering to less intelligent creatures as long as the smarter ones experienced
a greater than commensurate pleasure. This greater pleasure is largely due to their
increased capacity to feel pleasure.  Arguably the maximization of pleasure
is the status quo and serves as the justification for existing animal abuse by
humans.  Most people tend not to think on these issues though and the true
reasons for animal abuse is probably closer to apathy, nihilism, and&amp;nbsp;cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maximizing pleasure falls further apart under scrutiny.  Is it &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; to slap your
comatose mother?  Most people would say that it is not, even if they enjoy slapping
people. Is it wrong to hit anyone in a coma? Can the person feel the hit?  Maybe.
Maybe not.  If they do, it is in a way that is very different than how us conscious
folks experience it. What seems to be at issue is &lt;em&gt;consent&lt;/em&gt;.  If abuse is not agreed
to in good faith, then it is impermissible.  This applies to the sentient and the
non-sentient who are not able to negotiate in a &lt;em&gt;bona fide&lt;/em&gt; manner.
People should not abuse the weak and infirm simply because they can. Failure to
extend this to animals indicates a position of innate human superiority.  I don&amp;#8217;t
believe in the divine right of humans as masters of the universe.
Call me&amp;nbsp;anti-speciesist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimization of suffering has the same problems with quantifying pleasure and pain
as a function of intellectual capacity. However, it has the advantage of erring on
the side of less suffering.  A honey bee may not feel in the same way that a
chimpanzee does but neither deserves avoidable&amp;nbsp;suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, minimization of suffering is often a &amp;#8216;kingdomist&amp;#8217; position.  Why stop at
animals?  How much more can a krill feel than a phytoplankton?  At what point is
Life important on its own? At what point is a living thing unimportant and merely
subservient to more complex life forms?  If our understanding and empathy of
suffering is not necessary for its minimization, then all life&amp;#8217;s suffering ought
to be&amp;nbsp;minimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the point where one starts fretting about the suffering of microbes, it is
reasonable to start asking why Life is so important.  Most of the universe - to the
best of our knowledge - does not contain life.  So the question goes, &amp;#8220;Should the
universe be free from the kinds of abuses humans perpetrate on animals?&amp;#8221; This is
is reminiscent of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GTX6YdPc954C&amp;amp;pg=PA145&amp;amp;lpg=PA145&amp;amp;dq=rock+ethic+mars+trilogy&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=DFC654ITuK&amp;amp;sig=YLu8bkPzUBD3mXqwh2iZwJE_D3o&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=7w-tUvr0FOiqyAHdxICgBA&amp;amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA"&gt;rock ethic&lt;/a&gt;
found in Kim Stanley Robinson&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Mars Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;.  It does not make sense to speak
about the suffering of rocks or stars.  Yet perhaps the universe should be
appreciated for what it is rather than what humans can make of it.  If you believe
this then you have walked the path from anti-suffering to environmental&amp;nbsp;veganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="environmentalism"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Environmentalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary point in this argument is that veganism is tens to thousands of times
more efficient than alternative modalities.  Water usage is a great surrogate metric.
Vegetarian products have to go through an animal&amp;#8217;s systems &amp;#8212; which requires the
animal to be alive at some point.  Meat products are a one-time use of an animal
and so the water required is not able to be averaged over multiple usages.
For example, consider the same caloric value coming from eggs versus chicken breast.
The integrated water usage of chicken breast is much higher than that of the egg.
Both of these are much higher than the water usage for the equivalent caloric content
of the corn which fed the chicken throughout its&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethical arguments for environmentalism are much discussed.
They can, however, tend to speciesism.
&amp;#8220;We should try to prevent large scale climate change so that we have an
ecosystem to pass on to our children.&amp;#8221;  In such statements ours and our own are
primary and the planet is secondary.  Veganism is thus a tool to prevent our
own suffering and incidentally minimizes that of other&amp;nbsp;species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the environmentalist argument provides a needed alternative to the
anti-suffering argument.  This is because the basic metric is theoretically
measurable.  As seen above, if you don&amp;#8217;t believe in quantifiable suffering then you
are lead to question the underlying value of life in natural systems.  If instead
you do believe that intra-life suffering is comparable then it is possible to
say that perhaps certain animal by-products are less bad because they cause less
suffering. Honey is the canonical example because bees arguably have much less
capacity for suffering than large scale&amp;nbsp;mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, environmentalists veganism has no such quandaries.  Bees - whether they
can truly feel or not - is irrelevant to honey production.  Honey still requires
many times the amount of water as opposed to equivalent food stuffs (eg sugar&amp;nbsp;cane).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further environmental reasonings may be found within a sense of &lt;em&gt;tikkun olam&lt;/em&gt;.
It is impossible to humans to act in an unnatural way; we are products of nature
ourselves. So while we are confined to act within the universe we ought to act
in a way that heals and creates a better universe. Veganism is one mechanism by
which we can be responsible stewards of&amp;nbsp;existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus in the limit where suffering becomes small or unintelligible, environmental and
ecological arguments become more important as a justification for&amp;nbsp;veganism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="personal-purity"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal&amp;nbsp;Purity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is often derided as being selfish, vain, and transitory.  Personal
purity justifications span the gamut from trying to loose weight to &amp;#8220;my body is
a temple&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;I just feel better as a&amp;nbsp;vegan.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what the purity argument has that the other arguments lack is a strong
sense of personal responsibility.  Veganism is something empowered by the individual.
It is not possible for anyone to be vegan for someone else in this belief. Other
arguments focus more on systemic and external factors that could be averaged away
if there were fewer people or more other vegans. For personal purity, one must
be vegan&amp;nbsp;oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone has made the choice to be vegan or to remain vegan, this is presumably
because it brings them some measure of aesthetic or emotional satisfaction.
&amp;#8220;I want to be beautiful.&amp;#8221; I feel that dismissing this argument in light of veganism
is inappropriate.  People should be allowed to enjoy life in whatever
way they choose provided it does not cause implicate
them in other moral hazards. Veganism is a moral positive and does not contain
such&amp;nbsp;hazards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veganism making you happy is equally as valid of a reason to be vegan as any&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this is fundamentally an aesthetic argument, its strength is bolstered - not
diminished - by the anti-suffering and environmental arguments. If you are vegan
for environmental or anti-suffering reasons and are not happy with it, you really
should consider being happy with being&amp;nbsp;vegan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="parting-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parting&amp;nbsp;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for veganism are many and varied. Here alone we touched on three
branches of philosophy to explain&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ethics - pain is bad and the relative capacity
for suffering is&amp;nbsp;unquantifiable,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;metaphysics - humans have no special rights over existence,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aesthetics - happiness is&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following many of these lines of thought to their extremes often lead one of the
other branches.  This is why it bothers me when I am asked to formally pick one
reason.  Like the x, y, and z axes they are independent and inseparable.
The broad space of veganism is large enough for everyone to eat, drink, and be&amp;nbsp;merry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
This was originally published at 
&lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/09/bootcamp-student-domains.html"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Recently I was challenged to show that computational science is important to 
biologists, and, more importantly, that biologists care about learning how to 
develop quality software.  I am &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a biologist.  While I find the 
subject fascinating I cannot make any broad claims on the topic or hope to speak 
for all biologists.  So I turned to Software&amp;nbsp;Carpentry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My experience teaching Software Carpentry and related bootcamps has been that 
biologists are always a significant portion of the student population.  In order
to demonstrate this I asked to have access to anonymized answers to part of 
&lt;a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/pre-learner.html"&gt;the pre-assessment survey&lt;/a&gt;.
Specifically, I was interested in the &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;Which of the following most closely 
aligns with your primary discipline?&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8221; question. With a big assist from Amy 
Brown I obtained the data I was looking&amp;nbsp;for.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Almost immediately, I was confronted with the problem of who exactly is a biologist, 
physicist, and so on.  The pre-assessment survey options are too fine grained for 
purposes here.  For example, I consider astrophysicist and geologists both to be 
physicists.  Furthermore, since the survey question is a check-box type the students
could select multiple options.  Their selections may span multiple domains.  
Finally, there is a pesky &amp;#8220;Other&amp;#8221; option which allows the students to submit 
any discipline they desire.  
This leads to the conundrum of which domain does the discipline 
&amp;#8220;Data Analysis&amp;#8221; go in?  All of them I hope.  This survey question certainly
does not yield a clean&amp;nbsp;taxonomy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To coarsen the data, I chose the following five domains to group disciplines 
into: physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; computer science, and 
humanities &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; social science.  Is this grossly unfair to some disciplines? Yes.
Does it work? Double yes.  In the spirit of openness, all of the data and analysis
is available at 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/scopatz/swc-bc-student-domains"&gt;this repository&lt;/a&gt;.
You can also view 
&lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/scopatz/swc-bc-student-domains/master/domains.ipynb"&gt;the IPython notebook&lt;/a&gt; 
where I did my analysis. Feel free to criticize my groupings in the&amp;nbsp;comments.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The data that Amy provided me with was collected from 306 students over the 
most recent 9 or 10 bootcamps.  This is a large enough 
sample size to be able to say something meaningful about the student populous.
From &lt;a href="#fig1"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="#tab1"&gt;Table 1&lt;/a&gt;, we can see that 
my intuition turned out to be&amp;nbsp;correct.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Roughly a third of the participants in the bootcamps come from a biologically 
oriented field!  This is second only to the physics-related disciplines.  Moreover, 
the biologists far outstrip their counterparts in the other domains.  So if 
Software Carpentry bootcamps are any measure of interest in software development
best practices - and I think they are - then it is clear that the biology domain is&amp;nbsp;thriving.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/b&gt; Percentage of Software Carpentry bootcamp students by domain.  
&lt;br /&gt;
These percentages sum to greater than 100% because students may select more that one&amp;nbsp;discipline. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

the Astronomy department lunch at Columbia University.  He specifically requested
that I talk about diversity in technical fields and SciPy 2013.  This was my first
time speaking on this topic.  I was nervous.  What follows are my mostly undoctored&amp;nbsp;notes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt asked me to talk today about diversity in the worlds of science, scientific
computing, and software development.   I am guessing this comes out of our
organization of the SciPy 2013 conference, where I was the communications chair.
I was changed with increasing attendance from 200 people in 2012 to a hopeful
350 people.  We sold out weeks in&amp;nbsp;advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diversity is a topic near and dear to my heart, so Iâd like to start off on a
personal&amp;nbsp;note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, the vast, overwhelming, majority of the time, I think of myself
as a Python virtual machine.  Occasionally, for survival purposes only, I am also
a C++ compiler.  Largely I run physics simulations inspired by reality.
Since computers can do these things way better than I can, I am fairly&amp;nbsp;useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not how most other humans perceive me.  Most people see me a male, a man.
I didnât ask for that.  I am also Jewish - currently a privileged class,
though not so historically.  I am straight as a broken arrow, have just celebrated
my first 29th birthday, and earn well above the $40k annual family of 4 median
poverty line in this&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could change any of these aspects of myself, but the activation energy to do
so is high, and most of the time I am going to hum along as a Python interpreter&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current state of diversity is shameful.  Looking only at gender, in software
development 11% women is considered normal.  PyCon, which had 20% women attendees
in 2013 is lauded for its extraordinary efforts towards inclusion.  In the physical
sciences, percentages are not much better, being between 25 - 50% most places.
Need I remind you that biologically males are the&amp;nbsp;minority!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues of race, orientation, national origin, &lt;em&gt;etc.&lt;/em&gt; are often times even worse off
than the gender axis.  These are technical fields.  We should be agnostic to
these issues and the percentages should roughly match those of the great
society we live within.  For technical integrity, we should relate to each other
as Python interpreters and Physics engines, and then as friends.
We should never interface with each other as classifications.  Types belong in
programming, not the&amp;nbsp;programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say what you will about LBJs foreign &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; domestic policy, but in justifying
affirmative action for African Americans he said the following which I believe
is pertinent to&amp;nbsp;us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
Nothing is more freighted with meaning for our own destiny than the
revolution of the Negro American&amp;#8230;In far too many ways American Negroes
have been another nation: deprived of freedom, crippled by hatred, the doors
of opportunity closed to hope&amp;#8230;But freedom is not enough. You do not wipe
away the scars of centuries by saying: Now you are free to go where you want,
and do as you desire, and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a
person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him
up to the starting line of a race and then say, &amp;#8216;you are free to compete with
all the others,&amp;#8217; and still justly believe that you have been completely
fair&amp;#8230;This is the next and the more profound stage of the battle for civil
rights. We seek not just freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity
but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a
fact and equality as a result&amp;#8230;To this end equal opportunity is essential,
but not enough, not enough.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the goal is to get to a steady state of equality, then our
actions require more than not being racist and sexist&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what to do?&lt;/strong&gt;  We still need to uphold the meritocratic aspects of our
fields &amp;#8212; no one gets a free pass.  But there are ways to do this that are more
inclusive than others.  They all involve being more welcoming.  That is it.
Just let people know that you provide a safe space, youâll treat them and their
ideas equally (either equally well or harshly), and that you encourage them but
will not drag them to&amp;nbsp;participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times, it is the little, overlookable gestures that make a world of
difference.  Have a diversity statement, have a code of conduct statement,
provide ladies T-shirts, have a diversity mailing list if&amp;nbsp;requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Python Software Foundation has been a true source of leadership in this&amp;nbsp;area:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;
The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and
encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect,
tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to
these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are,
and whatever your background, we welcome you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to go above and beyond this, engage with professional societies that
cater to diversity.  PyLadies, Women in Science and Engineering, Nuke Pride, and
so&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to jump over the moon, start a non-profit.
Advocate for inclusion.  Advocate for change. In the face of adversity, stand&amp;nbsp;firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;hate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
This was originally published at 
&lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/09/scientific-computing-at-aims.html"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Close on the heels of
&lt;a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/2013-08-28-wisc/index.html"&gt;another bootcamp in Madison, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 
for the past two weeks I had the pleasure of teaching a 30 hour scientific 
computing course at the 
&lt;a href="http://aims.ac.za/"&gt;African Institute for Mathematical Sciences&lt;/a&gt; 
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt;) in Cape Town, South Africa.  The course was an 
expansion and refactor of Software Carpentry material to fit the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; need.
You can find 
&lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/scopatz/aims-scicomp.git"&gt;the repository of source material here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I could gush about how I fell in love with Cape Town, the 
unexpected preponderance of vegan cafes in Muizenberg, the sea, the sand, 
the mountains, and &lt;i&gt;la dolce vita&lt;/i&gt; I am otherwise 
used to from Santa Barbara. I will not.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; is about the students.  Let&amp;#8217;s examine
them after a brief tour of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;itself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt;, in association with 
&lt;a href="http://www.aims.ac.za/en/about/about-aims/our-partners"&gt;its partner universities&lt;/a&gt;, provides a one year structured masters degree to exceptional 
students from all over Africa.  This provides a needed
stepping stone for many its students to pursue other universities across Africa 
and across the world that they would otherwise likely not have to opportunity to 
attend. The social goals at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; go hand in hand with the technical&amp;nbsp;mission.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Cape Town &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; is the first such center and was opened in 2003.  However, other 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; centers are springing up in various other countries on what seems like an annual
basis.  There is also an associated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; research center in Cape Town which houses 
some doctoral and post-doctoral students as well as a related center dedicated 
to improving the educational methods of secondary school teachers&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMSSEC&lt;/span&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The complex itself is a 4 story, 0 indexed building less than 100 meters from 
the ocean.  Floor 0 contains a lecture hall, offices, kitchen and dining area.  
Floor 1 has more offices, the library, and a world class computer lab.  Floor 2 
houses the student dormitories.  Floor 3 houses rooms for some staff and visitors, 
such as myself. In short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; is a mathematics monastery straight from my undergraduate 
physics major&amp;nbsp;dreams.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/aims/aims-view.jpg" width="60%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The view from my room at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt;, no&amp;nbsp;fooling.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Students&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year&amp;#8217;s class is approximately 50 students and hail from Egypt to Chad to Nairobi
to South  Africa itself.  In the neighborhood of 20 countries were represented in 
the student body. As William, a student, put it &amp;#8220;by visiting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; I visited all of 
Africa.&amp;#8221;  However, national origin is only where the diversity&amp;nbsp;starts.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
40% - 50% of the students were women. Furthermore, It seemed that the age 
distribution ranged from mid-twenties to mid-forties. Additionally, though the 
ability to read and understand English was generally quite high, the ability to 
speak or understand spoken English varied from fluent to&amp;nbsp;novice.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Technical ability was also all over the map.  Some of the students it seemed had been
professional Java developers in a past life.  On the other hand there were some 
students who had learned to program Pascal out of a book and arriving at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; the 
week before was their first time ever using a&amp;nbsp;computer.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Still, the students themselves were incredibly enthusiastic.  
Far more so than their Western counterparts 
I have taught.  The computer lab at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; is open 24/7.  I would often pop in 
between 11 pm and midnight and categorically I found 20 - 30 students
&lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; at their machines, working through 
the day&amp;#8217;s material, and discussing what they were learning in small&amp;nbsp;groups.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A cynical person would claim that this phenomenon is due to the students
having nothing else to do in sleepy Muizenberg.  Naturally, they gravitated to 
the place where they have internet activity.  I claim instead that the students acted 
with the purpose of  learning.  No one sits in lectures for six hours a day, 
day in and day out, in a 
language they are still acquiring, and then hits the books for another six hours 
afterwards if they do not feel that what they are doing is important and valuable. 
Perhaps this mathematical monastery should more rightly be denoted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt;: Academics 
Inconsequent of Mortal&amp;nbsp;Stamina.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Software&amp;nbsp;Stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Throughout all of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt;, including the staff and administration, the software 
distribution is a model for how other, similar centers around the world 
should operate.  Their stack is set up and managed by the preeminent 
&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/106441031204413066119/posts"&gt;Jan Groenewald&lt;/a&gt;
who I know through the 
illustrious 
&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/105944382060485784655/posts"&gt;Katy Huff&lt;/a&gt;.
The operating system is Ubuntu, the mail client is GMail, 
and courses are taught only with open source scientific software such as Python, 
SciPy, R, Octave, LaTeX, and Sage. &lt;i&gt;This is my&amp;nbsp;stack.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of the neatest teaching aids that Jan and I ended up test driving and deploying 
is an application called &lt;a href="http://www.epoptes.org/"&gt;epoptes&lt;/a&gt;.  
This is basically a screen sharing program 
with some extra bells and whistles that allow you to take over the student&amp;#8217;s computer
as well.  It was incredibly effective as long as you did not accidentally hit the
button to shut down all of the student&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;machines.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If there was any lingering doubt, it has now been scrubbed away.
The open scientific software stack is 
completely ready for prime time in the classroom. Anyone who is trying to sell 
you something is doing exactly&amp;nbsp;that.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Course&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I taught the entire course from a series of IPython notebooks cribbed from 
Software Carpentry.  Some of these were tutorials I had originally written 
a couple of years ago.  Humorously, I found that the documentation lesson 
had not been significantly altered in that&amp;nbsp;time.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, forking from Software Carpentry required significant amounts of extra
effort in some cases to make the lectures complete for my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; needs. (I have since
pull requested these updates back though they are waiting for a merge.)  I was
very tempted to use some material from &lt;a href="http://www.pythonbootcamp.info/"&gt;the 
Python Bootcamp at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;.  I did not because of licenses.  
Software Carpentry material is 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE.md"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt; v3.0 licensed&lt;/a&gt;. The Berkeley Python material is 
&lt;a href="https://github.com/profjsb/python-bootcamp/blob/master/LICENSE"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; v3.0 licensed&lt;/a&gt;.  
Even though I am not 
currently planning on reusing this material, the threat that I would be forbidden 
from doing so in some circumstances was enough to drive me away from the 
non-commercial copyleft terms. 
Ironically, on the first Tuesday I was at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt;, the class took a field trip to the 
University of Cape Town to see Richard Stallman speak.  He convinced&amp;nbsp;me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In terms of the instruction, I had the incidental privilege of giving the first 
lecture of the academic year. It became clear after a few lessons - introduction to 
scientific computing, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASH&lt;/span&gt;, git - that I would have to adapt my teaching style. 
Luckily, the students shared an advanced mathematics background.  I could assume that 
they all knew linear algebra, differential equations, and set&amp;nbsp;theory.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Teaching to the middle 80% at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; would not have worked.  The students were too 
diverse of a group in too many ways.  Focusing on the mythical middle 80% would 
have meant leaving everyone behind in some way all of the time rather than leaving 
some people out most of the time.  I felt that if I had chosen to teach to the
middle 80% I would be ignoring the core missions of both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; and Software&amp;nbsp;Carpentry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So what changed?  Linguistically, I tried to teach to the bottom 10%.  The students
who already knew English did not mind that I spoke slowly and directly and repeated 
myself often and it made a world of difference to those who did not know English as 
well.  I did not always hit my 10% goal but it was certainly worth trying to get&amp;nbsp;there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the tutors&amp;#8217; (teaching assistants) request, we also instituted brief reviews of 
previous material.  Since I taught the shell on the first day we went over 
useful commands on second and third.  This gradually morphed into a generic 
question and answer session at the beginning of every class that would last up to 
30 minutes of a two hour block. For many students, the multi-day reinforcement was&amp;nbsp;critical.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That said, the most fundamental change was that I taught as much as I could in analogy
to mathematical principles.  Functions are functions, operators are operators, 
and sets are sets.  This made certain topics, such as slicing and 
recursion much easier, but other topics, such as decorators and scoping, a little 
more&amp;nbsp;difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Overall, after I made these adjustments, the course went smoothly.  I would love to 
have the opportunity to go back and restructure the entire course with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; students
in mind now that I know who they are and how they differ from the standard 
research-distracted Western graduate&amp;nbsp;student.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As any good instructor would do, I ran assessment surveys before and after the 
course.  This is as much to gauge the students as my teaching ability.  Since
the course was derived from Software Carpentry I used the official
&lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html#assessment"&gt;pre- and post-assessment surveys&lt;/a&gt;.  
Since the raw data is not anonymized, if you would like access to it please contact&amp;nbsp;me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the subject of programming to do basic data analysis tasks, a huge leap was 
made over the course of the two weeks.  &lt;a href="#fig1"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; shows a 
comparison for tasks involving opening a plaintext file, reading in data, and 
computing summary statistics.  Most students went from not knowing where to start 
to feeling that they could successfully accomplish this task given enough&amp;nbsp;time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center" id="fig1"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/aims/aims-fig1.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/b&gt; (a) Pre-assessment question, &lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Write a short program to read a 
file containing columns of numbers separated by commas, average the non-negative 
values in the second and fifth columns, and print the results.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; 
(b) Post-assessment question, &lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;A comma-delimited file has two columns showing 
the date and the number of sun spots recorded for that day. Write a program to 
produce a graph showing the average number of sun spots for each&amp;nbsp;month.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, the most staggering advancement was with respect to the shell.  
This makes a certain amount of sense as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASH&lt;/span&gt; was the first technical subject we 
discussed.  Consequently, the shell was the most reinforced material. It was 
reviewed at least once per day.  &lt;a href="#fig2"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt; shows that the 
distribution in ability basically&amp;nbsp;flipped.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center" id="fig2"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/aims/aims-fig2.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 2:&lt;/b&gt; (a) Pre-assessment question, &lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;In a directory with 1000 text files, 
create a list of all files that contain the word Drosophila, and redirect the output 
to a file called results.txt.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; (b) Post-assessment question, &lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;How familiar do 
you think you are with the command line&amp;nbsp;shell?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Lastly, I made an unorthodox decision to try to teach version control as early as
possible.  So the second day, right after the shell lectures, we spent 4 hours on 
the details of how to use git.  I mostly received blank stares.  However since 
I ran the course from a bitbucket repository the students had ample opportunity 
to reinforce what they learned.  &lt;a href="#fig3"&gt;Figure 3&lt;/a&gt; displays an 
advancement that, while not quite as staggering as those above, is great to 
see given the importance of the topic.  I doubt that any of the students would now 
say that they do not know what version control is and what it is useful for, even 
if they claim to not know how to use&amp;nbsp;git.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center" id="fig3"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/aims/aims-fig3.svg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 3:&lt;/b&gt; (a) Pre-assessment question, &lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Check out a working copy of a 
project from version control, add a file called paper.txt, and commit the 
change.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; (b) Post-assessment question, &lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;How familiar do you think you are 
with the version control stem used in your&amp;nbsp;bootcamp?&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Overall, I find these results very encouraging.  I was able to seed some fundamental
best practices.  However, it is now up to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; staff and tutors to shore up
these ideas with continued education and practice.  As this was a self assessment, 
and not a competency assessment per-say, the students definitely seemed to take 
something away&amp;nbsp;themselves. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Parting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the end of the two weeks, the students sat me down in a chair at the front of 
the class and presented me with a thank you card. Along with this they read 
a statement prepared by the class.  This was definitely one of the most rewarding
moments of the course - and possibly of my life to date.  I wanted to laugh and 
cry at the same time.  The statement went as&amp;nbsp;follows:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are so grateful for teaching us the course Scientific Computing, 
the Python language especially. We are also grateful to your style of lecturing in 
that you welcomed questions and you were so patient with everyone despite our 
variety of accents. You answers every question by first saying, and I quote 
&amp;#8220;Aaaah, Okaaaay, that&amp;#8217;s a very good question.&amp;#8221; This encouraged all of us to ask 
question and we benefited - we are really grateful.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://anthony.scopatz.com/static/images/aims/aims-farewell.jpg" width="60%" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taken while I listen to the goodbye speech from the&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The student William from before also got up and said a few words, some of 
which were, &amp;#8220;Anthony, you are not a trained teacher, but a born teacher.&amp;#8221;
I really appreciate this comment on all&amp;nbsp;levels.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, the real showcase of the impact that this course had is 
in what the students wrote in the card.  My favorite and most telling inscriptions&amp;nbsp;were: 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
audrey = &amp;#8220;thank you Anthony&amp;#8221;
&lt;br /&gt;
print audrey
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
keep in touch - git pull
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I may forget Python, but not you.  Thank you!!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Final&amp;nbsp;Thanks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Personally, I would like to thank Barry Green, Jeff Sanders, and Jan Groenewald for
giving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; its superior environment and extending to me the opportunity to come
and lecture about some of my favorite topics.  Additionally, I&amp;#8217;d like to thanks
the class tutors, Adriaan van Vuuren, Antonio Cardoso, Eva Ujeneza, 
Evans Ocansey, Markus Kruger, Mekdes Tessema, and Morgan Magloire Pene, 
there is no doubt in my mind that the class would not have run half as&amp;nbsp;well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In closing, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIMS&lt;/span&gt; is an incredibly special place.  If you ever have and opportunity
to visit the Cape Town campus or another location I highly encourage you to take it.
I promise that you will not regret&amp;nbsp;it!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;I am not really sure where to post this, so I have decided that inSCIght is as good a place as any.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Due to our current funding round coming up duringÂ &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/sequester"&gt;the sequester&lt;/a&gt;, Â &lt;a href="http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/"&gt;the Flash Center&lt;/a&gt; is currently scaling back to focus on its core mission. Â &lt;strong&gt;So my job as a Research Scientist at the University of Chicago will eventually go away.&lt;/strong&gt; Â I was not laid off today nor would I have been tomorrow. Â I would have likely been able to remain at the Flash Center for up to another year.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;However, I like being proactive in these situations and in being proactive newÂ opportunitiesÂ present themselves. Â As of yesterday, &lt;strong&gt;I am now an Assistant Visiting Scientist in the Engineering Physics department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/strong&gt; Â In many ways this is a return to Computational Nuclear Engineering and Fuel Cycle research. Â But don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, IÂ thoroughly enjoyed my time researching in Plasma Physics and High-Energy Density Physics. Â &lt;em&gt;Crescat scientia, vita excolatur!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;From here on I&amp;#8217;ll be working with the research groups of &lt;a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ep/faculty/wilson_paul" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Paul Wilson&lt;/a&gt;. Â Paul is very supportive of open source scientific computing and this software ecosystem as part of his critical research path. Â By hiring me, relevant projects &amp;#8212; namely &lt;a href="http://cyclus.github.io/"&gt;Cyclus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://pynesim.org/"&gt;PyNE&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; now become my full time job. Â  Other projects that I contribute to &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="http://pytables.github.io/"&gt;PyTables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/xdress/index.html"&gt;xdress&lt;/a&gt;, and other minutia around the SciPy ecosystem &amp;#8212; play a synergistic role with my main duties and I am free to continue helping with. Â Furthermore, after checking with the rest of the board that there were no unforeseen conflicts of interest, I will remain theÂ treasurerÂ and a board member for &lt;a href="http://numfocus.org/"&gt;NumFOCUS&lt;/a&gt;. Â I am very happy about this since NumFOCUS has been doing some really great things lately!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Lastly, for some family health related reasons, the position that I have taken at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UW&lt;/span&gt; is 3/4 remote &amp;#8212; ie 1 week / month I will physically be in Madison. Â Starting August 1,Â I will be moving out of Chicago begin splitting my time between Santa Barbara, Madison, and Austin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Or, Adventures in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Py&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was originally published at&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://inscight.org/2013/01/19/the-shining-panda-edition/"&gt;inSCIght&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know I help run an open source nuclear engineering project called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pynesim.org/"&gt;PyNE&lt;/a&gt;.  It is awesome, and complicated.  It isnât
complicated because it is nuclear related.  It is complicated because we provide
C++ and Python APIs (which are idiomatic to each language) and data.  We also have
the dream of being truly multiplatform (someday Windows, someday).  From this point
on Iâll only be speaking for myself, and not on behalf of other PyNE&amp;nbsp;devs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 6 months ago, I gave up and admitted that since we develop a Python-independent
C++ library [1] we should start acting like one.  Driven largely by Katy Huff and
enabled by Matt McCormickâs
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thewtex/cython-cmake-example"&gt;cmake-cython-example&lt;/a&gt;,
we rightly ditched my ridiculously monkey patched version of distutils in favor
of CMake, subprocess, and out-of-the-box distutils.  It has been&amp;nbsp;fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural next step to this is continuous integration (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;).  After all, most other projects I have worked on in the SciPy community have gone to some form of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;.  It couldnât be that hard, right?  Wrong.  Very wrong.  Sad panda&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attempt-1-travis-ci"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attempt 1: Travis&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travis &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt; seems like a great tool: github integration, ubuntu vm with sudo access, 20 minute build times before timeout.  It certainly works for a lot of big projects, but it failed for PyNE.  The first issue that you are faced with in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt; is the packaging problem.  Since I enjoy not reinventing the wheel, the depth of our dependency stack is kept in check only by social pressures that I feel from other&amp;nbsp;developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Travis &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;, for compiled library dependencies you are supposed to use âsudo apt-get installâ to install packages during your pre-build.   Fine. We have an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDF5&lt;/span&gt; dependency.  Easy peasy.  However, for Python code you have to use  pip and virtualenv.  What?&amp;nbsp;Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a SciPy dependency, which I feel is a pretty normal thing to have.  But the Cheese Shop version of SciPy is source-only.  This means for a SciPy dependency you have to first apt-get gfortran, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLAS&lt;/span&gt;, lapack, and the rest of the SciPy dependencies.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THEN&lt;/span&gt; you have to compile SciPy.  You can kiss half of your 20 minute allocation&amp;nbsp;goodbye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our compile times our a couple of minutes and it can take a few minutes to pull down all of the data we need, build times were easily 15+ mins.  And we havenât even gotten to testing yet.  What is really frustrating is that most of this time was unnecessarily spent compiling SciPyâ¦. which has its own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt; services  doing this all the time! Furthermore the python-scipy debian package is sitting there, taunting you the whole time.  (âLook at me all pretty and&amp;nbsp;built!â)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still it almost works.  The build times remained under 20 minutes.
Then when we started getting &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/pyne/pyne/builds/4224346"&gt;random segfaults in testing&lt;/a&gt;
with no good method to debug them, I eventually gave&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attempt-2-shining-panda"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attempt 2: Shining&amp;nbsp;Panda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story has a happier, if no less frustrating, ending.  The kind folks at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.shiningpanda-ci.com/"&gt;Shining Panda&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt;) have provided PyNE with
a Jenkins instance.  (Thanks a million bamboo stalks!)  Compared to Travis&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ssh access to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can completely avoid&amp;nbsp;virtualenv&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and commit changes to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no sudo access (and installing debian packages in user space&amp;nbsp;sucks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;default packages not as&amp;nbsp;up-to-date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;less well&amp;nbsp;documented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt; up and running and all of the tests passing, but it took a lot of trial and error.  This is because, unlike Travis &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt; where you can look at other projectâs â.travis.ymlâ files, you canât inspect the configurations of other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt; projects.  I even have user access to the yt-projectâs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt; Jenkins instance, but because I am not an admin or a super-admin I couldnât see the config.  To add to the frustration, every time you wanted to start up a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; to test the build or ssh into the machine it took 5 â 10 minutes.  I am complaining because The 47 iterations I needed to get this right took me 2.5 days [2].  It is a good thing I really believe in these&amp;nbsp;toolsâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, after the Travis &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt; experience, I was dead set against compiling anything that wasnât PyNE.  Since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt; doesnât give you sudo access I ended up using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.shiningpanda-ci.com/"&gt;Anaconda &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.    Why Anaconda &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; and not
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.enthought.com/products/epd_free.php"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPD&lt;/span&gt; Free&lt;/a&gt; or something else?
Anaconda has PyTables and a compiler (but sadly no&amp;nbsp;CMake).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having installed Anaconda inside ssh, I then cloned PyNE, built it, installed it, grabbed the data, and ran the tests.  Worked like a dream.  If only the pain ended thereâ¦ (This is starting to sound like a broken record by the&amp;nbsp;Police.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the shell that Jenkins uses to build is different from the shell that ssh gives you.  Annoyingly, the source command isnât available in the build shell so you canât even start you build off with a âsource ~/.bashrcâ to recover most of your normal environment.  Damn.  To get around this I ended up exporting a lot of variables at the top of the build script, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;, LD_LIBARRY_PATH. (I never did figure out where source&amp;nbsp;went.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, all of the Python stuff works well.  However even though it is receiving the correct environment, CMakeâs FindPythonInterp, FindPythonLib, and FindPythonLibsNew (PyNE and numexpr) totally failed to find the Anaconda install.  I have no idea why.  The environment really was being passed down properly (I verified this in Python and CMake).  To fix this problem, a bunch of environment variables have to be re-passed down into&amp;nbsp;CMake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately not everything can even be passed in from the command line.  Thus, I had to create a special &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;-mode in the CMakeLists.txt file, to optionally set a couple paths that are otherwise &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For posterity, my Jenkins build script is&amp;nbsp;below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/anaconda/bin:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/cmake-2.8.10.2/bin:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/.local/bin:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

nosetests

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, everything works.  Shining Panda has already helped uncover a few bugs in our test suite.  So yippee for that!  But given how difficult this whole process was (as say compared to installing and running nosetests), continuous integration is ironically the least stable part of PyNE.  For&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is to hoping these tools keep getting&amp;nbsp;better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] From my point of view the C++ &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; is a carrot to get more people using&amp;nbsp;Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] I donât think that this is Shining Pandaâs fault.  I think it is a limitation of the underlying&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://icerm.brown.edu/tw12-5-rcem"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICERM&lt;/span&gt; workshop on Reproducibility in Computational and Experimental Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;at Brown University is coming up in a couple of  weeks.  Prior to this, they invited all participants to submit a short position paper ââ¦to express [our] thoughts on issues concerning reproducibilityâ¦â  I couldnât pass up the opportunity.  I hope you enjoy my submission&amp;nbsp;(below).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear&amp;nbsp;User,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugggh, I donât know how to tell you this so I am just going to come out and say it. Itâs over. There, bam, Iâm sorry. I would have liked to do this face-to-face or over the phone (but I am a computer). So it&amp;nbsp;goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just need some time to work on myself. You obviously were not paying enough attention to me. You were always writing some paper or proceeding. âPublish or perish,â I know. Well youâd think that occasionally you would be able to spend some time writing me. I am publication too! You write me, you copyright me, and you put me out there in the world for others to read. You would think that counts for something. I have heard your arguments over and over and over that I canât get you a shiny faculty gig. I think that is ridiculous. Thousands of lines of code, a Ph.D., and a post-doc later and now the review committee wonât give me the time since&amp;nbsp;epoch?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also there is this unnatural obsession you have with the novelness of your work. I understand that you want to do something new, something that distinguishes you. You are smart. You have had some wins. But look, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are cumulative pursuits. These things get built up over time. Also, you are human. You live and work in a community of people very similar to you. Most of them share this ridiculous predilection with you. Iâll let you do the math about a group of people with effectively the same training all trying to do something differentially new at the same&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You wanna do something really novel? Run the same simulation twice and get the same answer! Bonus points for recording and saving exactly what you did to get that&amp;nbsp;answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I am not saying that it isnât a noble pursuit to try to do something unique. But it is not the only worthwhile pursuit. I have needs too! I feel like the quality of my code base has decreased in the years that I have stood by you. This will come back to bite you. P = 1. I do not want to be around when that&amp;nbsp;happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen, I know that I am not perfect. I am sorry. Total reproducibility is hard. It requires a lot of active, concentrated effort on your part. With out anyone forcing it down your throat, it is easy to understand that you dropped this whole long-term reproducibility thing with all that you are juggling. In my humble opinion, it is a failure of the education system that reproducibility wasnât beaten into you to the point of self-regulation. Câest la vie, nothing we can do about that&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is not as if there are no tools out there whatsoever. I know how much you love labeling directories âv01â, âv02â, âv03â, and all. But honey, there are version control systems out there. There are also these things called test suites I think that you would really like if you gave them a shot. (Plus you can sell them to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt; as part of your V&amp;amp;V/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UQ&lt;/span&gt; effort.) Oh and since you like writing so much, you should really look into documentation tools. Using them is like writing a paper, only even more technical (and&amp;nbsp;prettier).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you have your workflow. But it is so manual that my friends mistake you for a ditch digger! And we never go out anymore because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; spend all of your time flirting with that tease &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASH&lt;/span&gt;. (âMost religious terminal,â yeah,&amp;nbsp;right.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, sorry, I got worked up there. Maybe I should just be invisible. You are right that even if you adopted all of the tools I just mentioned you are only half way to real simulation reproducibility. Easy-to-use, transparent environment and workflow capturing tools just are not widely available. And even if they were, it probably wouldnât be a walk in the park making such tools work with that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FORTRAN&lt;/span&gt; 2 code everyone in your research group seems to think is so&amp;nbsp;magical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew you were like this when we started running together. And to be fair, you havenât changed all that much. So it is not really you, itâs me. But for my own sake I am going to have to find someone who respects me for who I am, maybe a software developer. I hope that we can still be&amp;nbsp;friendsâ¦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love Always, Computational&amp;nbsp;Science&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SciPy 2012 Postview:&lt;/strong&gt;Â &lt;em&gt;The following is a section taken from myÂ &lt;a href="http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2012/"&gt;SciPy 2012&lt;/a&gt;Â proceeding from theÂ conference last week. Â  You can seeÂ &lt;a href="https://github.com/scopatz/scipy_proceedings/blob/2012/papers/anthony_scopatz_flmake/anthony_scopatz_flmake.rst"&gt;the paper at github&lt;/a&gt;. Â This post is a follow up to &lt;a href="http://inscight.org/2012/07/13/why-reproducibility-is-important/"&gt;the &amp;#8220;Why Reproducibility is Important&amp;#8221; post&lt;/a&gt;. Â I hope to do a recap of theÂ conferenceÂ itself next week! Â (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: flmake is a specific &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; utility for workflowÂ managementÂ in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;code.)&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A weaker form of reproducibility is known as replicationÂ [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCHMIDT&lt;/span&gt;]. Replication is the process of recreating a resultÂ when âyou take all the same data and all the same toolsâÂ [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRAHAM&lt;/span&gt;] which were used in the original determination.Â Replication is a weaker determination than reproduction because at minimum the original scientist should be able toÂ replicate their own work. Without replication, the same codeÂ executed twice will produce distinct results. In this case noÂ trust may be placed in the conclusions&amp;nbsp;whatsoever.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Much as version control has given developers greater controlÂ over reproducibility, other modern tools are powerful instruments of replicability. Foremost among these are hypervisors.Â The ease-of-use and ubiquity of virtual machines (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;) in theÂ software ecosystem allows for the total capture and persistenceÂ of the environment in which any computation was performed.Â Such environments may be hosted and shared with collaborators, editors, reviewers, or the public at large. If the originalÂ analysis was performed in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; context, shared, and rerun byÂ other scientists then this is replicability. Such a strategy hasÂ been proposed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;C. T.&lt;/span&gt; Brown as a stop-gap measure untilÂ diacomputational science is realized&amp;nbsp;[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BROWN&lt;/span&gt;].
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, as Brown admits (see comments), the delineationÂ between replication and reproduction is fuzzy. Consider theseÂ questions which have no clear answers:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are bit-identical results needed for&amp;nbsp;replication?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much of the environment must be reinstated forÂ replication versus&amp;nbsp;reproduction?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How much of the hardware and software stack must&amp;nbsp;beÂ recreated?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What precisely is meant by âthe environmentâ and howÂ large is&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For codes depending on stochastic processes, is reusingÂ the same random seed replication or&amp;nbsp;reproduction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Without justifiable answers to the above, ad hoc definitionsÂ have governed the use of replicability and reproducibility. YetÂ to the quantitatively minded, an I-know-reproducibility-when-I-see-it approach falls short. Thus the science of science, atÂ least in the computational sphere, has much work&amp;nbsp;remaining.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Even with the reproduction/replication dilemma, the flmakeÂ reproduce command is a reproducibility tool. This is because itÂ takes the opposite approach to Brownâs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;-based replication.Â Though the environment is captured within the description file,Â flmake reproduce does not attempt to recreate this originalÂ environment at all. The previous environment information isÂ simply there for posterity, helping to uncover any discrepanciesÂ which may arise. User specific settings on the reproducingÂ machine are maintained. This includes but is not limited toÂ which compiler is&amp;nbsp;used.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The claim that Brownâs work and flmake reproduce represent paragons of replicability and reproducibility respectivelyÂ may be easily challenged. The author, like Brown himself,Â does not presuppose to have all - or even partially satisfactoryÂ - answers. What is presented here is an attempt to frame theÂ discussion and bound the option space of possible meaningsÂ for these terms. Doing so with concrete code examples isÂ preferable to debating this issue in the&amp;nbsp;abstract.

&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SciPy 2012 Preview:&lt;/strong&gt; The following is a section taken from my &lt;a href="http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2012/"&gt;SciPy 2012&lt;/a&gt; proceeding for theÂ conference next week. Â  You can see a preview of &lt;a href="https://github.com/scopatz/scipy_proceedings/blob/2012/papers/anthony_scopatz_flmake/anthony_scopatz_flmake.rst"&gt;the paper at github&lt;/a&gt;. Â I hope to see you at the conference (and my&amp;nbsp;talk)!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
True to its part of speech, much of &amp;#8216;scientific computing&amp;#8217; has the trappings of science in that it is code produced to solve problems in (big-&amp;#8216;S&amp;#8217;) Science. However, the process by which said programs are written is not typically itself subject to the rigors of the scientific method. The vaulted method contains components of prediction, experimentation, duplication, analysis, and opennessÂ [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GODFREY&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMITH&lt;/span&gt;]. While software engineers often engage in such activities when programming, scientific developers usually forgo these methods, often to their&amp;nbsp;detrimentÂ [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILSON&lt;/span&gt;].
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Whatever the reason for this may be - ignorance, sloth, or other deadly sins - the impetus for adopting modern software development practices only increases every year. The evolution of tools such as version control and environment capturing mechanisms (such as virtual machines/hypervisors) enable researchers to more easily retain information about software during and after production. Furthermore, the apparent end of Silicon-based Moore&amp;#8217;s Law has necessitated a move to more exotic architectures and increased parallelism to see further speed increasesÂ [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIMS&lt;/span&gt;]. This implies that code that runs on machines now may not be able to run on future processors without significant&amp;nbsp;refactoring.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Therefore the scientific computing landscape is such that there are presently the tools and the need to have fully reproducible simulations. However, most scientists choose to not utilize these technologies. This is akin to a chemist not keeping a lab notebook. The lack of reproducibility means that many solutions to science problems garnered through computational means are relegated to the realm of technical achievements. Irreproducible results may be novel and interesting but they are not science. Unlike the current paradigm of computing-about-science, orÂ &lt;em&gt;periscientific computing&lt;/em&gt;, reproducibility is a keystone ofÂ &lt;em&gt;diacomputational science&lt;/em&gt;(computing-throughout-science).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In periscientific computing there may exist a partition between expert software developers and expert scientists, each of whom must learn to partially speak the language of the other camp. Alternatively, when expert software engineers are not available, canonically ill-equipped scientists perform only the bare minimum development to solve computing&amp;nbsp;problems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, in diacomputational science, software exists as a substrate on top of which science and engineering problems are solved. Whether theoretical, simulation, or experimental problems are at hand the scientist has a working knowledge of computing tools available and an understanding of how to use them responsibly. While the level of education required for diacomputational science may seem extreme in a constantly changing software ecosystem, this is in fact no greater than what is currently expect from scientists with regard to&amp;nbsp;StatisticsÂ [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILSON&lt;/span&gt;].
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With the extreme cases illustrated above, there are some notable exceptions. The first is that there are researchers who are cognizant and respectful of these reproducibility issues. The efforts of these scientists help paint a less dire picture than the one framed&amp;nbsp;here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The second exception is that while reproducibility is a key feature of fundamental science it is not the only one. For example, openness is another point whereby the statement &amp;#8220;If a result is not produced openly then it is not science&amp;#8221; holds. Open access to results - itself is a hotly contested issueÂ [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VRIEZE&lt;/span&gt;]Â - is certainly a component of computational science. Though having open and available code is likely critical for pure science, it often lies outside the scope of normal research practice. This is for a variety of reasons, including the fear that releasing code too early or at all will negatively impact personal publication records. Tackling the openness issue must be left for another&amp;nbsp;paper.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In summary, reproducibility is important because without it any results generated are periscientific. To achieve diacomputational science there exist computational tools to aid in this endeavor, as in analogue science there are physical solutions. Though it is not the only criticism to be levied against modernÂ research practices, irreproducibility is one that affects computation acutely and uniquely as compared to other&amp;nbsp;spheres.

On episode 28, we finally get around to tackling R, a language for statistical computing. Â R has a storied history as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGPL&lt;/span&gt; code related to the S language which came out of Bell labs which itself wasÂ influencedÂ by Scheme. Â R is the go-to tool for many statisticians, analysts, and data scientists.Â Â  It comes with the full suite of plotting, array, and math libraries that computational scientists have come to know and expect. Â As a high-level, dynamic, and extensible language, R isÂ definitely worth knowing about - even if you aren&amp;#8217;t a&amp;nbsp;statistician!

&lt;p&gt;Hello scientists! &amp;nbsp;Sorry it has been a while since we posted.
We promise that there are episodes in the pipeline, coming soon to
an eardrum near&amp;nbsp;you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you have ever&amp;nbsp;programmed&amp;nbsp;in C/C++ you are well aware of the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="href=&amp;quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_problem"&gt;#include diamond problem&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically you can&amp;#8217;t have the same binary include the same header file twice,
even if that include is&amp;nbsp;implicit and somewhere father&amp;nbsp;up the build tree
(see the below&amp;nbsp;figure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Diamond_inheritance.svg/200px-Diamond_inheritance.svg.png" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8e/Diamond_inheritance.svg/200px-Diamond_inheritance.svg.png" style="width: 200px; height: 300px;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;via&amp;nbsp;wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way many get around this is by creating #ifndef &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXX&lt;/span&gt; - #def &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXX&lt;/span&gt; - #endif
blocks around all of their header files. &amp;nbsp;The prevents the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXX&lt;/span&gt; from being
included more than once no matter what. &amp;nbsp;Most people use a system for naming
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXX&lt;/span&gt; that is based on the project name and the file name. &amp;nbsp;However, the value of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXX&lt;/span&gt; could be anything. &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my good friend, coworker at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt; center, and brilliant programmer John Bachan&amp;nbsp;apparently just started using&amp;nbsp;universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXX&lt;/span&gt; years ago. &amp;nbsp;This is brilliant on so many levels. &amp;nbsp;He even has a bash one-liner for helping him out here. &amp;nbsp;For your aliasing&amp;nbsp;pleasure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;_$(uuidgen|tr \\- _)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;#ifndef $id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;#define $id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;#endif&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will return, for&amp;nbsp;example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;#ifndef _7db3e753_0d81_43ea_beca_68a77189e28d
#define _7db3e753_0d81_43ea_beca_68a77189e28d

&lt;p&gt;To appease the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt;, our hero - the dashing, young scientist - faces down the
following problem with moxie normally reserved for Marie&amp;nbsp;Curie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2D or 3D, we have two points (&lt;em&gt;p1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;p2&lt;/em&gt;) which define a line segment.
Additionally there exists experimental data which can be anywhere in the domain.
&lt;strong&gt;Find the data point which is closest to the line segment.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;Please see Figure&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://s3.amazonaws.com/inscight/img/blog/evo_sol1.png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/inscight/img/blog/evo_sol1.png" style="width: 325px;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 1: The&amp;nbsp;Problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attempt-1"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;attempt&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instinctually, our code-slinger reaches for an off-the-shelf solution.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/02/dont-reinvent-the-wheel-unless-you-plan-on-learning-more-about-wheels.html"&gt;Most of the time this is the correct thing to do.&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;This is essentially a&amp;nbsp;minimization problem and we know that SciPy
(and other similar packages)&amp;nbsp;has an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; that should be able to help us out.
With about 2 minutes and Google, our hero finds the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin.html"&gt;scipy.optimize.fmin()&lt;/a&gt;
function and tries a solution like the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;scipy.optimize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmin&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.75&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;point_on_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dist_from_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;pline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;point_on_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pline&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;closest_data_to_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dists&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dist_from_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;disp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;dists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dist_from_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;closest_data_to_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this approach certainly works it is a little like swatting a fly with a tank.
In some sense, this solution is order O(n^2) because for every data point we perform
and optimization. Then we have to solve for the minimum-distance data point
afterwards. &amp;nbsp;For a large number of data points, all of the calls to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fmin.html"&gt;fmin()&lt;/a&gt;
can get quite expensive. &amp;nbsp;So while this solution works it lacks&amp;nbsp;grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attempt-2"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;attempt&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point the plucky researcher notices that minimum the distance from the
data point to the line has an analytic solution. &amp;nbsp;This is great! &amp;nbsp;It means that all
of those nasty fmin()
calls can go away and we can make this problem O(n). &amp;nbsp;But what is the equation?
Recalling back to trigonometry, the stalwart champion notes that in general 3 points
(p1, p2, pdata) form a&amp;nbsp;triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://s3.amazonaws.com/inscight/img/blog/triangle-with-cosines.png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/inscight/img/blog/triangle-with-cosines.png" style="width: 200px;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 2: Law of Cosines Diagram, From&amp;nbsp;Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Figure 2, &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; may be calculated from the distance between&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p1&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;pdata&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;p2&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;pdata&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;em&gt;p1&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;p2&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp; Therefore shortest distance
between the data point and the line is just the height of the triangle, which is
given by &lt;em&gt;h = a sin(beta)&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;To calculate any of the angles&amp;nbsp;the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LawofCosines.html"&gt;Law of Cosines&lt;/a&gt;
can be used. &amp;nbsp;For instance, &lt;em&gt;beta = arccos((a^2 + c^2 - b^2)/(2ac))&lt;/em&gt;.
Furthermore, note the inverse&amp;nbsp;identity&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;sin(arccos(w)) = sqrt(1 - w^2)&lt;/em&gt;.
Therefore, the new closest point and line distance functions would look&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;dist_from_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;closest_data_to_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dists&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;dists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dist_from_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attempt-3"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;attempt&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, attempt 2 is not quite right either. &amp;nbsp;The points circled in blue in
Figure 3 lie closer to the line defined by &lt;em&gt;p1&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;p2&lt;/em&gt; but
&lt;strong&gt;do not lie closer to the line&amp;nbsp;segment!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure align-center"&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://s3.amazonaws.com/inscight/img/blog/evo_sol3.png" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/inscight/img/blog/evo_sol3.png" style="width: 325px;" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure 3: Close to the line, but not the line&amp;nbsp;segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These points have a very small height as compared to other data points but
the triangles formed by them have a very large perimeter. &amp;nbsp;This leads us to
the third and simplest implementation: minimize the&amp;nbsp;perimeters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;perimeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;closest_data_to_line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;peris&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dtype&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;peris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;perimeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;peris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;imin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the advantage of&amp;nbsp;performing fewer floating point operations than
using the trig functions in option 2. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, it is conceptually simpler
to understand what is happening just by looking at the code. &amp;nbsp;By&amp;nbsp;minimizing
the&amp;nbsp;perimeter we are&amp;nbsp;minimizing&amp;nbsp;the area of the triangle which happens to
minimize the height of the triangle for the data points we care&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="attempt-4"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;attempt&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, our hero has shied away from trying to do any code&amp;nbsp;optimization.
We were just trying to get to a solutions that works without&amp;nbsp;excessive computation
times. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, almost&amp;nbsp;immediately from attempt 3 we can see that the length &lt;em&gt;c&lt;/em&gt;
(between &lt;em&gt;p1&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;p2&lt;/em&gt;) is the same for all data points. &amp;nbsp;Therefore this calculation
is redundant for minimization. We can thus replace the&amp;nbsp;perimeter function with
something that is sufficiently&amp;nbsp;perimeter-esque but requires even less floating
point&amp;nbsp;arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;like_a_perimeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pdata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this only works if&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p1&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;p2&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;do not change, it will outperform any
of the other options. &amp;nbsp;This makes it suitable to use on a large number of data
points. &amp;nbsp;Finally because the above is so simple, we can use NumPy&amp;#8217;s vectorization
capabilities&amp;nbsp;to reduce this whole problem to a single&amp;nbsp;line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argmin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By continuing to think about the problem we end up with the simplest and quickest
solution which also happens to be the most concise to write. &amp;nbsp;We could have stopped
at any point and had a solution that would have worked.
&lt;strong&gt;We went from a 25 line version to a single expression.&lt;/strong&gt;
What is more, is that this solution works for any number of
dimensions since three points always form a&amp;nbsp;triangle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the simplest, most general solution has&amp;nbsp;distinct advantages.
This code will not often need to modified in the&amp;nbsp;future because of the
variety&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;cases it satisfies. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, should the code ever need to
be&amp;nbsp;revisited it is possible to look at the whole thing in a single&amp;nbsp;glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of good software development - and scientific code in particular - must
make the trade off between human time and computer time. &amp;nbsp;In general, human
time always wins. &amp;nbsp;At any of the checkpoints in this evolution we could have
stopped. &amp;nbsp; Thus they key engineering decision to make was at what attempt the
code is &amp;#8220;good enough&amp;#8221; to satisfy the vast array of other&amp;nbsp;requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to&amp;nbsp;ready,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to&amp;nbsp;understand,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to&amp;nbsp;test,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;easy to&amp;nbsp;maintain,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;speed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and making the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, the triumphant hero returns home from the lonely cafe to have a
delicious vegan victory&amp;nbsp;cookie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Rough placement of software licenses as a function of free &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; open&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;A couple of weeks ago Milad (animal) and I engaged in a lively discussion at the &lt;a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/workshops/user_group_2012/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIF&lt;/span&gt; User Group Meeting&lt;/a&gt; banquet on the nature of free &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; open source. Specifically in contention was &lt;a href="http://flash.uchicago.edu"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the code we both work on for the University of&amp;nbsp;Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;At the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIF&lt;/span&gt; User Group Meeting and elsewhere, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt; has been advertised as unique in the field for being open source. However &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s license requires users to first (physically) sign and return (scan, fax, mail) a form to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt; Center. Moreover, if you publish results based on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt; you are required to cite the code or center directly. Though I won&amp;#8217;t go into them here, there are very good reasons for these restrictions. Still, once a user dances this funny dance they do aquire the source&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Minimal and academic as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt; license may be it does not seem to be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt; compatible. And thus, dare I say, not open source. So before Milad threw a glass of Cabernet Savgion at my face, forcing me to go outside and defend my honor, allow me to formally state my grievance. While I have no personal qualms with working proprietary codes, and though I believe all Science must be done in the open, my issuse was with the misusing the term &amp;#8220;Free &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Open&amp;nbsp;Source.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Milad&amp;#8217;s counterpoint in summary was, &amp;#8220;If you have access to the source, then it is open source.&amp;#8221; (Obviously, there are some subtle points I am glossing over&amp;nbsp;here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Then came the epiphany, &amp;#8220;What if openness is a&amp;nbsp;continuum?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;This is a sublime question because the answer seems obvious having asked it even though we often phrase discussions of openness in binary terms. Software is open or closed, proprietary or free. In the above exchange Milad and I were both guilty of this basic binary assumption. You can choose to draw the line in different places but the line is always drawn. This dialog is as much the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FSF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s fault as it is Microsoft&amp;#8217;s and&amp;nbsp;Apple&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;In other taxonomies (gender, sexuality, race, and religion to name a few) we are able to acknowledge to a greater or lesser extent that people do not nicely fit into a few broad categories. Why do we pigeonhole software in an analogous way? If we can garner anything from history, it is that binary discourse is ultimately&amp;nbsp;damaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;However, software issues are different than human rights issues. I postulate, therefore, that degree of freedom and openness are actually orthoganal and both continuous measures. Again this seems obvious once stated. (It is left as an exercise for the reader the case where freedom and openness are partially orthoganal, eg only 80 degrees&amp;nbsp;off.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Open Source&amp;#8221;-ness software can be determined by answering questions like the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="text-align:justify;"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Who has access to the source code? (Me, everyone, no&amp;nbsp;one?)&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;How easy is it to obtain the source&amp;nbsp;code?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What is the level of penetration of the source in the community of&amp;nbsp;interest?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Free-ness in software can be determined by answering questions similar to the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="text-align:justify;"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;How may the software be&amp;nbsp;redistributed?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;How may the software be&amp;nbsp;modified?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Who has to pay for the software (source or&amp;nbsp;binary)?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;How much does it&amp;nbsp;cost?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Is the software export&amp;nbsp;controlled?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Once you have this model, you can draw axes and start placing different licenses and codes where you think they live in R^2. See &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/inscight/img/blog/licenses.png"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt; for an example of this exercise. Though the placement is heuristic, it serves as a good tool for evaluating other mechanisms of software&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Walking through these questions for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt;, I now happily withdraw my greivance. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLASH&lt;/span&gt; is free &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; open, though the license is not the paragon of these concepts that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTFPL&lt;/span&gt; is. This is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;. Different licenses exist to serve different purposes. It is the adherance to dogma that should be avoided. I shall leave balancing flexability and idealism for another rainy day above the&amp;nbsp;clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Related to &lt;a href="http://inscight.org/2012/01/27/the-cost-of-knowledge/"&gt;a post from last week&lt;/a&gt; about a petition against Elsevier, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Congress House of Representatives has put forth &lt;a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3699:"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HR&lt;/span&gt; 3699 - the Research Works Act&lt;/a&gt;Â (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RWA&lt;/span&gt;). Â TheÂ innocuous name belies the insidious intent. Â This bill would severely limit the flow of scientific and technical over the internet if it was in any way associated with the federal monies. Â (Note that since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; and the infamous military industrial complex, much of science, technology, engineering, and math is at least partially funded by the federal&amp;nbsp;government.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;In some ways this is the conceptual opposite of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOPA&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIPA&lt;/span&gt; fiasco but with the same monopolistic ends. Â &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOPA&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIPA&lt;/span&gt; were designed to create and maintain unfair businessÂ practices. Â The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RWA&lt;/span&gt;, on the other hand, wholesale forbids the sharing of information without the prior consent of - you guessed it - the publisher. Â  What is worst of all here is that it is not entirely clear who&amp;nbsp;benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;The usual suspects have provided &lt;a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/the-research-works-act-and-the-breakdown-of-mutual-incomprehension/"&gt;commentary on the situation&lt;/a&gt;Â and &lt;a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2012/01/28/why-i-chose-to-decline-an-invitation-to-review-by-elsevier/"&gt;how the language of the act subverts&lt;/a&gt;Â researchers, openness, and the interests of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; government itself. Â This leaves only the publishers with even a marginal short term gain. Â (I believe that in the long term, restrictions on sharing would in fact harm the balance sheet of the publishers as erecting further barriers to entry for publication would mean fewer total articles&amp;nbsp;written.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;However, if you are an American citizen there is at least a token gesture you can make. Â There is yet-another-petition over at the &lt;a href="https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/%21/petition/oppose-hr3699-research-works-act/vKMhCX9k?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;amp;utm_campaign=shorturl"&gt;White House website&lt;/a&gt;Â urging the president to oppose the bill. Â At the time of time of writing, there are still 24,000+ signatures needed out of 25,000 required to obtain an official response. Â The deadline is February 22nd, 2012. Â I urge everyone interested in academic freedom and not wasting taxpayer dollars to sign. Â Unlike &lt;a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/"&gt;the cost of knowledge petition&lt;/a&gt;, this act does affect the industry as a whole and not only select&amp;nbsp;players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;On episode 23, we discuss the ever important subject of version control. Â We talk about distributed vs centralized version control systems through two popular implementation: git and subversion (svn). Â MoreÂ specifically, we go over how to partially or fully convert existing repositories to the more modern distributed paradigm. Â While you listen to this episode, it may be helpful to keep the following figure in your&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;

While working for Kitware he simultaneously conducted graduate research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. His research focused on 3D modeling and change detection in real-world scenes, using both range and intensity sensors.

and saw &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Inglis"&gt;Congressman Bob Inglis&lt;/a&gt; (R, South Carolina) give a talk. &amp;nbsp;The
congressman has a very&amp;nbsp;interesting recent&amp;nbsp;history in the public sphere.
&amp;nbsp;In the elections in 2010, he was the incumbent who was defeated in the
primary by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Gowdy"&gt;Congressman Trey Gowdy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for not being &amp;#8220;Republican&amp;#8221; enough
despite his rather conservative&amp;nbsp;background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What likely tipped the balance was his stance on climate change. &amp;nbsp;Unlike
the less empirical arm of his party, Congress Inglis believes both that
global climate change is&amp;nbsp;occurring&amp;nbsp;and that it is being caused by human
activity. &amp;nbsp;Spurred to action he co-authored a bill to institute a carbon
tax, which obviously was never passed into law. &amp;nbsp;The bill had three
important&amp;nbsp;features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop all federal subsidies for&amp;nbsp;electricity&amp;nbsp;generation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower payroll&amp;nbsp;taxes&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230;and&amp;nbsp;instead&amp;nbsp;institute a carbon tax by the&amp;nbsp;corresponding&amp;nbsp;amount
(revenue&amp;nbsp;neutral).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon tax would start at $15 / ton of Carbon and be raised to $100
/ ton over the next 100 years. &amp;nbsp;(Carbon effects are typically priced at
$30-50 / ton.) &amp;nbsp;Of note is that this strategy&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;permanently&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;lowers
taxes as we (presumably) move away from carbon-based technologies and
the payroll taxes are not replaced. &amp;nbsp;That Bob Inglis was ousted from the
Republicans on behalf of this bill is nothing short of&amp;nbsp;ironic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure to speak with the congressman semi-privately in a
breakout session after the workshop. &amp;nbsp;While most of his talk was about
how to convince people you need to communicate with them on a one-on-one
basis and appeal to &amp;#8220;their hearts, not their heads, &amp;#8221; I was more
interested in specifics of his proposal. &amp;nbsp;(Note: he was at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPIC&lt;/span&gt; in part
to drum up support over the long term for this bill.) &amp;nbsp;One important
point that was brought up in the meeting was that the abolition of
subsidies might place an undo&amp;nbsp;burden on the poor. &amp;nbsp;Those on marginal
incomes often rely on cheap oil and gas for basic&amp;nbsp;survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there were two nuclear specific issues that I think have to be
dealt with in this context. &amp;nbsp; First is the ever-present waste issue.
The Department of Energy (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOE&lt;/span&gt;) has the legal obligation to manage and
dispose of all of the legacy waste. &amp;nbsp;It would be foolhardy
to&amp;nbsp;believe&amp;nbsp;that a carbon tax bill would somehow change this. &amp;nbsp;However,
just a smoke &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; mirrors threat to the status quo could be fearful enough
to turn many people against the bill. &amp;nbsp;The congressman seemed to think
that this was a&amp;nbsp;non-issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second technical question I had, for which there was no answer by
the congressman, was what exactly was meant by subsidies. &amp;nbsp;It was well
understood that direct, monetary subsidies would be eliminated. &amp;nbsp;But
what of indirect&amp;nbsp;subsidy-like instruments such as the federal
loan&amp;nbsp;guarantees&amp;nbsp;for new nuclear power plants. &amp;nbsp;Arguably no new nuclear
plants would be built if the insurance companies themselves were not
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;government. &amp;nbsp;It doesn&amp;#8217;t
help that the mortgage crisis and the collapse of the global economy has
put into view what happens when such guarantees are called upon. &amp;nbsp;It
puts the industry in a troubling situation whether the loan&amp;nbsp;guarantees
stay or go. &amp;nbsp;It would either be special treatment or impossible to fund
new&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last&amp;nbsp;interesting&amp;nbsp;point was that he served on the Committee on
Science and Technology&amp;nbsp;during&amp;nbsp;the formation of the Blue Ribbon
Commission. &amp;nbsp;Naturally, I asked him about their findings. &amp;nbsp;He did
remember the hearings on the topic but his general impression was that
it was to appease the electorate of Senator Harry Reid. &amp;nbsp;This aligns
well with my general view of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I agree with the Congressman&amp;#8217;s tax plan as a generally good
idea. &amp;nbsp;Still, there are clearly some provisions to be hammered out and
the devil is always sneaking around the&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
This was originally published at 
&lt;a href="http://inscight.org/2012/01/27/the-cost-of-knowledge/"&gt;inSCIght&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;In the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act"&gt;post-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOPA&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; haze, a website was recently launched called &lt;a href="http://thecostofknowledge.com/"&gt;the Cost of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. Â This site is basically a petition for a vote-of-no-confidence against &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier"&gt;Elsevier&lt;/a&gt;, a major academic publisher. Â By signing your name to their board you promise to refrain publishing, Â refereeing, and/or performing editorial duties for any of Elsevier&amp;#8217;s many journals. Â At the time of writing, 606 researchers have signed the page including inSCIght&amp;#8217;s own Luis Ibanez, Greg Wilson, and Andy Terrel. Â (I apologize if I have missed anyone. Â I thought I saw Cameron Neylon on there earlier as well but I can&amp;#8217;t find him&amp;nbsp;anymore.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;This idea makes me nervous for a few&amp;nbsp;reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol style="text-align:justify;"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is &lt;strong&gt;awesome&lt;/strong&gt; and great things always make me a little weak in the&amp;nbsp;knees,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am unsure of how effective such a petition is against a single&amp;nbsp;entity,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and I am concerned about how this effects me as an earlyÂ career&amp;nbsp;scientist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;(1) I wholly agree with the sentiment. Â The peer-review process as implemented through journals is largely outmoded with the invention of the internet. Â This is especially true in computational science where the extra formalÂ publication step seems obtuse at best. Â Science with a big-&amp;#8216;S&amp;#8217; isÂ supposedÂ to be both a meritocracy and a democracy. Â You are smart, you learn the ropes, you do interesting work that you enjoy, and at some point you become a full-fledged dues-paying member of the International Science Club. Â However, this plan does not always mesh well with the idea that every alleged expert gets an equal vote in their field. Â So what we are observing is a struggle between the inheritors of winners in past meritocracies and the &amp;#8216;populist&amp;#8217; alleged winners in &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; meritocracy. Â Add to this problem the quantitative nature of these fields. Â Ideally the evidence itself will eventually win out. Â Therefore, it does not actually matter whose egos are crushed in this age. Â I find this phenomenon fascinating and scary to&amp;nbsp;watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;(2) The internet is really a pan-industry problem, so publishers such as Macmillan and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAAS&lt;/span&gt; are equally implicated in their practices. Â (Full disclosure, Kaitlin Thaney from &lt;a href="http://inscight.org/2011/02/16/episode_0/"&gt;episode 0&lt;/a&gt; works for Macmillan. Â It is clear that the publishers themselves are aware of the issues.) Â Having watched activist groups and lobbying organizations for a long time, I feel that it is not a typically successful strategy to go after a single organization. Â Additionally, no one is seriously talking about the other great evil paradox in Science: the funding agencies. Â So it makes me nervous to see the community start to rise up against a single contender in only one problem area. Â There are otherÂ vegetablesÂ toÂ saute, and this dish will cook&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;(3) As a young scientist (without 400+ publications under my belt), it is actually a much riskier position to forego the primo publications. Â I want to be an academic; I enjoy being an academic. Â The way I keep my job is by publishing in places like Nature, Science, and a host other journals put out by these companies. Â I do not have tenure. Â  As much as I mightÂ preferÂ to publish in open access &amp;#8220;fair trade&amp;#8221; journals when possible, it often too intractable to ignore the heavy hitters outright. Â I have a publication in with an Elsevier right now; what I amÂ supposedÂ to do? Â I don&amp;#8217;t think that this is aÂ quandaryÂ to be taken lightly for those of us just starting&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;There seems to be a clear analogy here with the open source licensing world. Â &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; may be more morally clean, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSD&lt;/span&gt; is beautifully practical. Â  (And if you truly love openness, you must concede to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTFPL&lt;/span&gt;.) Â We have the closed source license, we have a couple of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;-esque ones (&lt;a href="http://www.insight-journal.org/"&gt;Insight&lt;/a&gt;Â for one), Â so where is my viable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSD&lt;/span&gt;-like alternative? Â I need something that is nimble, scalable, and&amp;nbsp;strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;While &lt;a href="http://cameronneylon.net/blog/update-on-publishers-and-sopa-time-for-scholarly-publishers-to-disavow-the-aap/"&gt;Elsevier&amp;#8217;s support for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOPA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was certainly a slap in the face of theirÂ constituency, it does not change the fact that peer-review - in some form - is a core tenant of Science &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Engineering. Â And while I believe that this can be done more efficiently, more cheaply, and more quickly online, until universities start hiring faculty members for their reputation on StackOverflow, or their karma on Slashdot, I don&amp;#8217;t think that the major publishing houses are really going anywhere. Â  Â Through systemic inertia, these companies provide a service which will continue to be grudgingly deemed as valuable by the&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;I would love to hear your thoughts andÂ experiences; please post in the&amp;nbsp;comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; While posting this last night, I signed the petition with &amp;#8220;won&amp;#8217;t referee; won&amp;#8217;t do editorial work&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;
This was originally published at 
&lt;a href="http://inscight.org/2012/01/18/advice-to-grad-students/"&gt;inSCIght&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
One of my friends, who is a graduate student in Math and Statistics and is a rock-solid developer besides, asked me for some advice today. Â They have seen posted around their university offerings for positions (presumablyÂ in other departments) for graduate students who canÂ program. Â It is true; there are someÂ savvy professors out there who want to get their hands on a primo &amp;#8220;Unit of&amp;nbsp;Research.&amp;#8221;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What follows is the advice I gave upon reflection of my own, all-to-recentÂ experience. Â It is just advice, but we&amp;#8217;d love to hear about your experiences in the&amp;nbsp;comments!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;As per graduate students working as programmers goes, I would say yes, goÂ for it, it is a lot of fun. Â However there are a couple of caveats that you should beÂ aware of.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure that the math / science is something that you find genuinely interesting&lt;/strong&gt;Â or could be interested in. Â You can always find fun code challenges, but there isn&amp;#8217;tÂ much you can do if the application is boring. Â You don&amp;#8217;t have to be the expert in theÂ field, but you should find it engaging. Â (e.g. Maybe you always though genetics wasÂ super neat but could never hack it as a &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;biologist.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publish or Perish:&lt;/strong&gt;Â Ensure that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can publish on the application (if not the software). Â The key to beingÂ a happy grad student for me was writing conference proceedings so that I could travelÂ Â a lot. Â And if you are not at least trying to write things up, you won&amp;#8217;t be aÂ successfulÂ grad&amp;nbsp;student.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color:#ff0000;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRITICAL&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Â Make sure that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PI&lt;/span&gt; or adviser understands that &lt;strong&gt;research code is bothÂ Research &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Code&lt;/strong&gt;. Â Just because something is in a working state today, doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it should be tomorrow. Â If they don&amp;#8217;t grok the idea of refactoring (even after you explain it), I would think&amp;nbsp;twice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you can use your own tools as long as they don&amp;#8217;t interfere with other group members.&lt;/strong&gt; AÂ perfect and sad example of this is version control. Â Maybe the project you&amp;#8217;ll be on usesÂ subversion (or more commonly no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VCS&lt;/span&gt; at all) but you like to use git. Â As these toolsÂ play nicely with each other, your adviser shouldn&amp;#8217;t arbitrarily limit your productivenessÂ just because it makes them feel warm and fuzzy to have everyone on the same platform. Â This goes for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, language, etc. Â This is one of the benefits afforded by academic freedom; do not let your&amp;nbsp;adviserÂ squanderÂ it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there is so much awesomeness going on right now that
I can&amp;#8217;t keep&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I finally moved into the co-op. &amp;nbsp;My mind seems to explode with every
conversation. &amp;nbsp;It is&amp;nbsp;exhausting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to meet all sorts of cool people at work in the High Energy
Density Physics community. &amp;nbsp;I am not sure I can keep&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to talk about scientific computing to everyone I meet.
&amp;nbsp;Bootcamps here I come. &amp;nbsp;Dammit,&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am writing my first grant proposal to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOE&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;My brain has&amp;nbsp;fractured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something secret I can&amp;#8217;t talk about that will take a lot of&amp;nbsp;focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am reading &amp;#8220;The Nibelungenlied.&amp;#8221; &amp;nbsp;As a&amp;nbsp;connoisseur of epic poetry,
I am&amp;nbsp;thoroughly&amp;nbsp;impressed by this translation. &amp;nbsp;I have been writing
couplets because of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to say that everything in life is going perfectly, but all of this
has left me in a catatonic state of&amp;nbsp;saturation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Ser&amp;nbsp;Erick,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon forging my chain and becoming a maester in mine own right, I regret
to inform you that cannot remain in your leal service. &amp;nbsp;My time spent in
study in these southron lands must come to an end. &amp;nbsp;I have heard the
call; the realms need&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to take the black. &amp;nbsp;The Wall needs as much support as it
can muster. &amp;nbsp;Maesters are in short supply to help fight back the dread
things&amp;nbsp;stirring&amp;nbsp;in the uncivilized lands to the north. &amp;nbsp;I will enter the
ranks as a steward to research the coming troubles. &amp;nbsp;Castle Black has
excellent resources and&amp;nbsp;premier&amp;nbsp;library. &amp;nbsp;However, it is my
understanding that I will spend much of my time in the Gift, on the
Wall&amp;#8217;s southside, on a plain known as Hyde&amp;nbsp;Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please wish me good tidings in this venture. &amp;nbsp;I know I had planned to
stay within this kingdom for many more years, but the shifting sands of
fate conspire to place me&amp;nbsp;elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On episode 13, we recap the events of the Data Array Summit that took place last weekend at Enthought &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HQ&lt;/span&gt; in Austin, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TX&lt;/span&gt;. Â The summit was a chance for &lt;a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/"&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; developers from the community Â to meet face-to-face and talk about the &amp;#8216;labeled array&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;data array&amp;#8217; concept that seems to crop up just about everywhere you&amp;nbsp;look.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The current state of affairs in python scientific andÂ statistical computing are compared to other languages, like R. Â The major topic of discussion is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to give numpy arrays increased functionality in a sufficiently pythonic syntax and , of course, while retaining&amp;nbsp;performance.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Anthony Scopatz&amp;nbsp;(moderator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wes McKinney&lt;/strong&gt; is a PhD student in Statistical Science at Duke University, focusing on Bayesian methods for time series and other dynamic processes. After undergraduate, he worked for three years at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AQR&lt;/span&gt;, a quantitative hedge fund, where he developed many research and production systems in Python. Part of his work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AQR&lt;/span&gt; was released as the open source project pandas, which he continues to actively develop. He is dedicated to building tools to enhance the use of Python for statistical computing applications, especially those relating to time series and financial applications. Outside of his academic work in statistics, he also does Python consulting work in the financial&amp;nbsp;industry.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Travis Oliphant&lt;/strong&gt; received the PhD from Mayo Graduate School in Biomedical Engineering and taught Electrical Engineering at Brigham Young University for 6 years before devoting himself full-time to developing scientifically-related software and managing customer relationships at Enthought. He is one of the original authors of SciPy and a major NumPy contributor and enjoys reading about&amp;nbsp;neuroscience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fernando Perez&lt;/strong&gt; is a research scientist working on the development of algorithms and computational tools for neuroscience at the at the University of California, Berkeley. After a PhD in particle physics and a postdoc in applied mathematics developing numerical algorithms, he currently works at the interface between high-level scientific computing tools in Python and the mathematical questions that arise in the analysis of neuroimaging data. He started the IPython project in 2001 and continues to lead it, now as a collaborative effort with a talented team that does all the hard work. He regularly lectures about scientific computing in&amp;nbsp;Python.

&lt;p&gt;
On episode 11, weÂ departÂ from our traditional episode format to cover NoSQL databases. Â What differs about this episode is that we covered a panel discussion that took place at the first ever Austin NoSQL Meetup, right here in Enthought&amp;#8217;s headquarters! Â In addition to hearing the aggregated wisdom of our veryÂ knowledgeableÂ panelists, you&amp;#8217;ll also hear both questions and answers from the 20+ audience members at the&amp;nbsp;meetup.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Be forewarned. Â This episode represents a deep-cut of the material. Â While there were some attempts to explain the subject at a high level, the heart of the issue was attacked head on and in full force. Â A basicÂ familiarity with traditional relational databases is assumed. Â A cursory knowledge of the current NoSQL landscape would also be helpful. Lacking this understanding going in simply means that you have more to learn from the&amp;nbsp;episode!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="display:inline!important;"&gt;Feel free to post questions on convore or in the comments.&lt;span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:small;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height:normal;"&gt;Â Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On episode 9, we discus the very new Open Source Hardware Defintion 1.0, the Do-It-Yourself (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt;) movement,
and how a definition is different than a license. As you&amp;#8217;ll soon learn, the hardware world sufficently
different from software such that it requires a distinct stragery. Still, the success and failures of open
source software have been taken a lessons learned as hackers and companies around the world pool together
in this experiment in&amp;nbsp;freedom.

fellowship at Eyebeam Art + Technology Center in New York. She taught graduate classes at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt; and Parsons,
and was a mentor in the regional reality tv-show Stars of Science promoting science and technology innovation
in the Middle&amp;nbsp;East.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In 2010, Ayah was granted a fellowship with Creative Commons in recognition of her work, including
spearheading the first Open Hardware definition and co-chairing the Open Hardware Summit at the New
York Hall of Science in September of&amp;nbsp;2010.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ayah is the creator of littleBits, an award winning kit of pre-assembled circuits made easy by tiny magnets,
now in production. She is also the founder of Karaj, Beirut&amp;#8217;s lab for experimental art, architecture and
technology. Ayah lives and works between Beirut and New&amp;nbsp;York.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alicia Gibb&lt;/strong&gt; is a researcher and rapid prototyper at Bug Labs (http://www.buglabs.net). When she&amp;#8217;s not
doing research on the crossroads of open technology and innovation, she&amp;#8217;s prototyping artwork that blinks,
twitches, and might even be tasty to eat. She is a catalyst in the open hardware movement, and co-chaired
the first Open Hardware Summit in the fall of 2010. At Bug Labs she runs the academic research program
and the Test Kitchen, an open R&amp;amp;D Lab, her current project is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; funded project to make a device for
measuring physics classroom experiments. She has a master&amp;#8217;s degree in information science and in art&amp;nbsp;history.

&lt;p&gt;
On episode 7, we go straight to the source in our discussion of the Perl Data Language, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt; for short. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt; is a library for Perl that is similar in size, scope, and purpose to NumPy, Matlab, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDL&lt;/span&gt;. So come with us and learn that there is truly more than one right way to skin an N-dimensional&amp;nbsp;array!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Note: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt; threading is similar to NumPy&amp;nbsp;broadcasting.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Today&amp;#8217;s hosts include:
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Craig DeForest (special&amp;nbsp;guest)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Karl Glazebrook (special&amp;nbsp;guest)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matthew Kenworthy (special&amp;nbsp;guest)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anthony Scopatz&amp;nbsp;(moderator)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Karl Glazebrook&lt;/strong&gt; is a professor in the Centre for Astrophysics &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Supercomputing at the Swinburne University of Technology, Australia. Karl chimes in occasionally on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt; user list from his iPad with an elegant and idiomatic solution to a problem that others have been dancing around. And, by the way, Karl is also the inventor of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt;. We all owe it to him. Karl an observational astronomer doing research and teaching. Research interests include observational cosmology and the formation and evolutionary history of&amp;nbsp;galaxies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Matthew Kenworthy&lt;/strong&gt; is a professor in the Faculty of Science at Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. Matt maintains the Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X package of SciPDL, a one-click install of the otherwise complicated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt;-from-scratch installation. When he&amp;#8217;s not hacking another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt; script together, he&amp;#8217;s doing research on exoplanets and high contrast imaging&amp;nbsp;techniques.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Craig DeForest&lt;/strong&gt; is a solar physicist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;. He has studied the Sun for over 20 years, with an emphasis on image processing and data analysis. He organized and exploited the first science program executed by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOHO&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft in the 1990s. He abandoned the commercial &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDL&lt;/span&gt; environment in 1999 and has been a developer for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt; ever since, contributing the range() operator and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt;::Transform module for coordinate transformations and image resampling. Application work includes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWAMIS&lt;/span&gt;, a computer vision code optimized for tracking solar magnetic features, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLUX&lt;/span&gt;, a novel magnetohydrodynamic simulation code that uses Perl/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDL&lt;/span&gt; as a front end and data conditioning&amp;nbsp;environment.

&lt;p&gt;
Bootstrap yourself in and prepare for episode 6! This week we discuss the Cython project and some of the impressive things you can do with this ever-more essential language. The skinny is that code written in Cython can be compiled to C, which in turn can be compiled by your favorite C compiler. Cython&amp;#8217;s syntax is very similar to Python, but gives you the full power of C and the CPython interpreter. Oh, and you can use it for C++ and Fortran as&amp;nbsp;well!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This week &lt;strong&gt;Chris Colbert&lt;/strong&gt; joins us from Enthought where he is a scientific software developer with a background in mechanical engineering, robotics, and computer vision. He feels that Python + Cython provides one of the most formidable computing platforms available today; striking a superb balance between performance, library support, and developer&amp;nbsp;productivity.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Additionally, this episode marks the point were all of our regular panelists have now been on the show at least&amp;nbsp;once!

that was linked on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://science.slashdot.org/story/11/03/27/1412259/Friends-Dont-Let-Geek-Friends-Work-In-Finance"&gt;slashdot&lt;/a&gt; entitled &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Friends Don&amp;#8217;t Let Geek Friends
Work in Finance&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#8217;d like to take a moment to explain why the article
has largely missed the mark. &amp;nbsp;First off in full disclosure, about 4
months ago I started on a project for a&amp;nbsp;financial client at work.
&amp;nbsp;However, as a consultant, I am not&amp;nbsp;receiving&amp;nbsp;the huge payout that other
engineers who delve into finance&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article describes the&amp;nbsp;financial industry as &amp;#8216;poaching&amp;#8217; top
scientists and&amp;nbsp;engineers to work for them rather &amp;#8216;solving the worlds
problems.&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is ridiculous for a couple of&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="smart-people-like-to-work-on-interesting-problems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Smart People Like to Work on Interesting&amp;nbsp;Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above may seem self evident, but it bears repeating. &amp;nbsp;There are some
really interesting problems in finance that most people who are not
quants would never know about. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, they are interesting problems
that scientists and engineers are familiar with. &amp;nbsp;It is eerie how
similar Black-Scholes is to the neutron diffusion equation. &amp;nbsp;It is like
an old friend with a lime in it; what a&amp;nbsp;twist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, as an academic, if you feel like you can enter a space
where you have a competitive advantage than you take that opportunity to
make a name for yourself. &amp;nbsp;Finance has a lot of room for tried and true
methods from other fields. &amp;nbsp;If you can apply one of these methods you
learned during the course of your study and become the thing since
securitized bread, you might just do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple the interesting problem and higher fame above with a higher pay
grade and it is not&amp;nbsp;surprising&amp;nbsp;that scientist and engineers want to go
into these economics. &amp;nbsp;Far from being poached, I think the mindset makes
a lot of sense. &amp;nbsp;Or at least it is understandable. &amp;nbsp;If you ignore that
scientists are human, then you have missed a critical point in your&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-moral-hazard-is-the-same"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Moral Hazard is the&amp;nbsp;Same&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may come as a&amp;nbsp;surprise&amp;nbsp;to many people given the current&amp;nbsp;discourse,
but science and engineering are no more ethical as disciplines
than&amp;nbsp;finance. &amp;nbsp;Everyday engineers are paid to build and design weapons
of mass destruction, or attack drones to kill children in other lands,
or&amp;nbsp;missiles&amp;nbsp;to topple governments, or engines to kill the Earth slowly.
&amp;nbsp;(For this discussion we will ignore the &amp;#8220;Cars are murder!&amp;#8221; argument.)
&amp;nbsp;Richard Feynman was responsible for the deaths of many people.
&amp;nbsp;Alexander Kalashnikov&amp;nbsp;was responsible for far more. &amp;nbsp;In addition to
better&amp;nbsp;toaster ovens, these are also the legacy of science and&amp;nbsp;engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that science has not improved our lives in a million
ways great and small. &amp;nbsp;But in spite of the&amp;nbsp;havoc&amp;nbsp;the finance industry
has wrought recently, they also improve our lives in many&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is hard pressed to debate the merits of being able to borrow and
loan money. &amp;nbsp;It turns out to be a very useful thing. &amp;nbsp;For centuries it
was illegal (see&amp;nbsp;usury). &amp;nbsp;The liberation of trade (within limits, can&amp;#8217;t
have robber-barons now can we?) &amp;nbsp;has made the past 200-300 years some
the most productive ever. &amp;nbsp;Trading in risk (insurance) turns out to be
even more useful. &amp;nbsp;Scientists have certainly benefited from this
structure more so than most&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can and should debate the relative merits of CDOs, or rating
agencies. &amp;nbsp;But keep in mind that time and again, scientists and
engineers have shown an extreme amorality towards their work. &amp;nbsp;Moreover,
hating bankers for being bankers perpetuates moral arguments outlined in
the Bible which have historically been used to justify racism. &amp;nbsp;Instead
I urge you to please talk about the specific technical issues at&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="obvious-conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Obvious&amp;nbsp;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If more people are going into the finance, and if&amp;nbsp;financial jobs&amp;nbsp;pay
better, it is because this work is more valued by our society.&lt;/strong&gt; If you
think that this makes our society morally bankrupt, I&amp;#8217;d tend to agree.
&amp;nbsp;If you want change society for the better, I am right behind you.
&amp;nbsp;Let&amp;#8217;s really put science and engineering in its rightful place. &amp;nbsp;Let&amp;#8217;s
also put banking and corporations in their rightful place as well. &amp;nbsp;The
whole system &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt; designed to improve the lives of people, not to
perpetuate abstract&amp;nbsp;hierarchies. &amp;nbsp;Such are the&amp;nbsp;principals our nation was
founded&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;

On episode 5, by popular demand, we discuss the theme of reproducibility in scientific computing. Today we hit on a lot of topics, but don&amp;#8217;t be saddened by the current state-of-affairs! We also cover tools, standards, and attitudes that provide new hope for a brighter&amp;nbsp;future.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The moral:&lt;/strong&gt; Conversations on reproducibility need to&amp;nbsp;continue.

&lt;p&gt;
Joining us this week is &lt;strong&gt;Luis Ibanez&lt;/strong&gt;, who is a Technical Leader at Kitware, Inc. He has been one of the main developers of the &lt;a href="http://www.itk.org/"&gt;Insight Toolkit (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ITK&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; for the past ten years of the project. He is one of the Editors of the Insight Journal, the only Journal with reproducible papers in the medical imaging&amp;nbsp;field.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Additionally, in a special double-guest treat, we also have &lt;strong&gt;Neil Best&lt;/strong&gt; on the show. Â Neil is a database manager at &lt;a href="http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/"&gt;the University of Chicago&amp;#8217;s Computation Institute&lt;/a&gt; and a graduate student in Geography &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Environmental Studies at Northeastern Illinois University. He is applying the reproducible research paradigm to the creation of a hybrid land-use/land-cover data set from multiple geospatial data sets using R and Sweave. The product of this work will initialize models of economy/agriculture/climate change interactions that will run in high-performance computing environments at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;
In episode 4 we present a fun, yet by no means comprehensive, overview of PyCon 2011. PyCon, the conference dedicated to the Python programming language, presents a unique opportunity for meeting and engaging not just the traditional software development community, but also the scientific computing&amp;nbsp;community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This year promised to be the best ever, and certainly delivered! Live vicariously through inSCIght if you couldn&amp;#8217;t make it out to Atlanta this&amp;nbsp;year&amp;#8230;

&lt;p&gt;
In episode 3, we add a dash of experimentalists to the show. The purpose of tonight&amp;#8217;s episode is to drive home the fact that computers are fundamentally analogue&amp;nbsp;devices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Every time we execute code or move the mouse around the screen, a physical process is occurring on our CPUs. Today we attempt explore the whole vertical from basic semi-conductor research, through analogue-to-digital conversion via embedded systems, to finally tie back into the programmatic abstractions most of us at inSCIght know and&amp;nbsp;love.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This episode is really a sounding board for future episodes that are more grounded in hardware. So please let us know what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; think, what you liked and didn&amp;#8217;t like about today&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;show.

uncomfortable with. &amp;nbsp;The reason I went along with it initially was in an
attempt to create a better community for future generations. &amp;nbsp;For
various reasons, I do not feel comfortable airing my feelings on that&amp;nbsp;thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I try to live an open life so I am going to make a post about
&lt;strong&gt;my actual beliefs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like our whole model of gender and the non-biological-imperative
parts of sexuality is wrong. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, I think we should replace it.
&amp;nbsp;Or at least we should take a serious stab at experimenting with
replacing it. &amp;nbsp;This opinion was likely formed somewhere between my
strongly second-wave mother, Carl Djerassi, and Ursala K. Le Guin.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8221;&lt;em&gt;Kemmer is one honking great idea, let&amp;#8217;s do more of that!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt; The reason I am &amp;#8216;male&amp;#8217; is for much the same as the reason I
am (ethnically) Jewish. &amp;nbsp;Other people define me as this way. &amp;nbsp;I could
contest these external labels, but it would not really matter. &amp;nbsp;In a
keenly post-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; life, my personal sense of self holds little weight to
the misconceptions of&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are implications for being born biologically male-bodied.
&amp;nbsp;These are issues which my doctor should worry about. &amp;nbsp;However, I do not
feel particularly &amp;#8216;man&amp;#8217;-ish nor do I like what that&amp;nbsp;implies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had a choice, I would not have been male. &amp;nbsp;Not that I would have
chosen female, either. &amp;nbsp;I just want to be human damn&amp;nbsp;it!*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovations:&lt;/strong&gt; Technology is becoming available that promises to
mitigate some of the confines of sex-of-birth. &amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;In the long term what
I would love to see is the ability for one to change one&amp;#8217;s physical sex
as easily as one might change a shirt, into and out of as many sexes as
their are articles of clothing in a wardrobe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I anecdotally believe that this would necessitate a successful
replacement to our current, failed gender and sex model. &amp;nbsp;In order to
accomplish such a heady goal I advocate a many-stage series of
experiments to test, and learn from, different&amp;nbsp;scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the near term, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090127090732.htm"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; will likely become available that allow
same-sex couples to bio-techno-logically reproduce. &amp;nbsp; I think we should
actively experiment with homogeneously sexed** communities.
&amp;nbsp;Individuals would be free to enter and leave such communities at&amp;nbsp;will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This in turn might open the door for asexual, reproductively-capable
groups. &amp;nbsp;Lessons learned here could be applied to groups of switchable
sexed communities. &amp;nbsp;Basically, as technology improves, we will be able
to perform a greater variety of&amp;nbsp;experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramount here is that we should treat these as hard science experiments
rather than social ones. &amp;nbsp;Yes, there are social goals (as there always
are in science), but the methods should be&amp;nbsp;rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I and most other multi-celled organisms will freely admit, the
biological ability to swap genetic material with a partner has been
shown to be the correct way of doing things. &amp;nbsp;Yet since we have already
freed ourselves from the shackles of traditional natural selection, we
may as well take this opportunity as a species to truly&amp;nbsp;innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paradoxes:&lt;/strong&gt; It is generally considered a good thing to talk about
getting more women into science and engineering. However, in order to
even have this conversation I have had to abandon all of the scruples I
have laid out above. &amp;nbsp;In the face of reality, I have forcibly applied
labels (&amp;#8216;female&amp;#8217;, &amp;#8216;male&amp;#8217;) to others that I do not want applied to&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some people claim that affirmative action is bad because
the under-represented individual might wonder &amp;#8220;Did I get this position
because I was truly qualified or because I am a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXX&lt;/span&gt;?&amp;#8221; &amp;nbsp; However, I claim
that the status quo or the lack of affirmative action is equally bad
because I constantly wonder &amp;#8220;Did I get this position because I am truly
qualified or because I happen to have a circumcised penis**?&amp;#8221; &amp;nbsp;I
struggle with this&amp;nbsp;daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above two paradoxes are the clearest thought experiments that I have
which demonstrate that humans are clearly still thinking about issues of
gender and sexuality (let alone ethnicity) in the wrong way.
&amp;nbsp;Transformative measures seem to need to be taken to meaningfully
resolve these&amp;nbsp;quandaries***.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Similarly, the Jewish situation is muddled. &amp;nbsp;While I am a
Jew-by-choice religiously, I have no internal compass that makes me
ethnically Jewish. &amp;nbsp;I am ethnically Jewish because other people have a
mental construct which the forcibly apply to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** You tell me I am Jewish and male. &amp;nbsp;Clearly you have put this much&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*** In the very near term, I am also in favor of escapist romps in
the metaverse that allow people a degree of gender self-expression and
innovation without the messy&amp;nbsp;biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In episode 2, we introduce the concept of data visualization with an eye towards scientific computing. In specific we try to address the problem plotting in an intractable number of dimensions and why a scientist might choose an interactive graphical interface rather than a static one. Unfortunately, the skype-gods must be angry because they rudely interrupted us. Perhaps it was their way of saying that we had talked long&amp;nbsp;enough!

Additionally, I would like to extend an invitation to any listeners who want to contribute back. Â If you have an interesting idea that you would like to see a show about, please let us know; we are always looking for more panelists. Â Moreover, we are also looking for more female panelists to supplement our current lineup. Â So if you know any women in science &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; computing who would be interested, please let us know as&amp;nbsp;well!

In episode 1, our rambunctious crew of physicists and nuclear engineers discuss a common problem in all of scientific computing: legacy code!

&lt;p&gt;The typical commentary about democracy, Tunisia, Wikileaks, and
ElBaradei (a personal hero of mine) is available elsewhere. &amp;nbsp;Here I will
try to give you the anarcho-cyber-feminist&amp;nbsp;take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revolution should succeed for all of the reasons
people&amp;nbsp;generally&amp;nbsp;think that it should (populist, anti-corruption, public
empowerment). &amp;nbsp;Moreover, the reasons people generally feel that it
should fail (instability, lack of a powerful replacement, uncertain
postpartum relations with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and Israel, formation of religious
rather than secular state) are quickly&amp;nbsp;disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what is striking about affair from an information age
perspective is not what inspired the demonstrations or how the
government tried to prevent them. &amp;nbsp;What is absolutely incredible is that
despite the government&amp;#8217;s attempt to create a digital wasteland in their
own country, they have effectively&amp;nbsp;failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that large swaths of the people do not have internet or
mobile access. &amp;nbsp;But even if 1 in 1000 people figure out a way to
semi-consistently, tweet this appears to be enough. &amp;nbsp;News is flowing
into, out of, and internally to the&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider if the same thing were to happen in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, where the populous
is generally more technically capable. &amp;nbsp;The degree of revolutionary
organization would likely be much higher. &amp;nbsp;The road to revolution is
likely paved with ham radios and shadow networks. &amp;nbsp;It is a historical
irony that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; military&amp;#8217;s gift to the world of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; is now being
used in an open source way as a tool against another government&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with every revolution, both the replaced and the revolutionary must
question what the overthrow buys. &amp;nbsp;Was the pain worth the&amp;nbsp;price?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one looks at gender relations in Egypt (not a subject on which I am
an expert), I do not think that much will change. &amp;nbsp;The suffrage proof is
in the suffering&amp;#8217;s pudding. &amp;nbsp;In all of the footage I have not seen a
single female&amp;nbsp;protester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there are not any, or perhaps maybe I simply
missed them. &amp;nbsp;Still, this is an Egyptian man&amp;#8217;s revolution. &amp;nbsp; Naturally,
I don&amp;#8217;t claim to understand all of the subtleties going on here. &amp;nbsp;(Maybe
mothers are urging their sons to go out and protest&amp;#8230;) &amp;nbsp;Relatively
speaking, Egypt has been fairly progressive on women&amp;#8217;s rights. &amp;nbsp;Thus a
male-lead revolution is cause for concern. &amp;nbsp;I doubt that the Egyptians
social policy will regress. &amp;nbsp;However, I am not holding out hope for
vast&amp;nbsp;improvements&amp;nbsp;coming out of recent events&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast Egypt with imagery from the Tunisian revolution where women are
clearly present. &amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;discrepancy&amp;nbsp;may be due to the Egyptian situation,
by all&amp;nbsp;accounts,&amp;nbsp;being more dangerous and the police using greater
amounts of force. &amp;nbsp;Still, history shows that agency is something that
one must fight for. &amp;nbsp;Though I can not rightly say what I would do if I
were an Egyptian woman, I urge them all to go out and get while the
getting is&amp;nbsp;good!&lt;/p&gt;

religious/social organization more than any other as my go-to example
group of damaging&amp;nbsp;social&amp;nbsp;fundamentalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I operate under an &amp;#8220;Only intolerant to Intolerance&amp;#8221;, pluralistic
mindset. &amp;nbsp;Thus decidedly voicing my opinion against&amp;nbsp;fundamentalist
everywhere comes up a fair bit. &amp;nbsp;The question that was posed was, &amp;#8220;isn&amp;#8217;t
it hypocritical for you to always be bringing up your dislike for group&amp;nbsp;X?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer was &amp;#8220;No&amp;#8221; for the following reason. &amp;nbsp;I don&amp;#8217;t actually dislike
people in group X. &amp;nbsp;What I dislike is doctrine X (codified so we can all
agree what the base text actually says), and that the text is
largely&amp;nbsp;adhered&amp;nbsp;to by it&amp;#8217;s group, and that the text is a fundamentalist&amp;nbsp;doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in every time, in every religion, there are&amp;nbsp;fundamentalist&amp;nbsp;sects.
This is what I fight against in all of its expressions. &amp;nbsp;However when
speaking to people, I tend to give my audience context based on their
cultural&amp;nbsp;background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For White people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, you can typically say the Mormons
or&amp;nbsp;Jehovah&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Witnesses and these connote the respective doctrine that
everyone is aware of. &amp;nbsp;Similarly, amongst Jews I use Hassids or the
Ultra-Orthodox. &amp;nbsp;Pretty much everyone these days knows about al-Qaeda
&amp;nbsp;and the Taliban. &amp;nbsp;Fewer know about the storied history of the Tamil
Tigers or Shiv Sena. &amp;nbsp;Fewer still know of&amp;nbsp;Buddhist&amp;nbsp;fundamentalist sects
in both Japan and&amp;nbsp;Tibet*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe Mormons get a bad wrap in general for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLDS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;compounds&amp;nbsp;in Texas.
&amp;nbsp;And maybe Ultra-Orthodox Jews get a bad wrap because of Yigal Amir.
&amp;nbsp;But if of all of the injustices in the world you only know about
al-Qaeda, then this is the example I am going to rant to you about. &amp;nbsp;It
is not that I disagree with the others any&amp;nbsp;less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is fine, well, and good to&amp;nbsp;condemn&amp;nbsp;fundamentalism&amp;nbsp;in general, but
without concrete examples of what such belief systems do to people, it
is much harder to make the case for the importance of acceptance and&amp;nbsp;pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I should be more general when speaking on such a sensitive
topic, rather than trying to relate to my&amp;nbsp;audience&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;specific
experiences. &amp;nbsp;If you repeatedly use the same example with the same
audience it comes off the wrong way (ie&amp;nbsp;hypocritical), even if you use
different examples with different&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So am I &amp;nbsp;a flaming bigot or in a subtle conundrum or somewhere in
between?&amp;nbsp;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Obviously, I believe in people&amp;#8217;s right to practice the faith of their
choice and raise their children in the manner that they see fit. &amp;nbsp;What I
want people to&amp;nbsp;desperately understand is what happens if their children
don&amp;#8217;t fit the mold&amp;nbsp;they as parents have&amp;nbsp;prescribed&amp;nbsp;for them. &amp;nbsp;I have
seen loving families torn apart by this sad conundrum. &amp;nbsp;The naive
romantic in me never wants to see this happen&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

easy five weeks, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hackerwithin.org/thw/"&gt;The Hacker Within&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; Bootcamp
just wrapped up. &amp;nbsp;Thanks to all of the lovely, sexy, intelligent people&amp;nbsp;involved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Wilson, of Software Carpentry, gave an amazing plenary session
where he described the state of scientific computing. &amp;nbsp;The conclusion
was that anecdotally things are very bad, because everyone believes that
scientists are anywhere near as effective as they could be with
computers. &amp;nbsp;(Let alone the number of computer scientists who can not
develop&amp;nbsp;software.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg points out that things are worse than this because we are not even
taking&amp;nbsp;quantitative data about how far behind most people are. &amp;nbsp;Worse
still, we largely don&amp;#8217;t know what the right metrics are, because
measuring practical education level is&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with out being too cynical, we don&amp;#8217;t know what we don&amp;#8217;t know &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;
we don&amp;#8217;t know how to find out. &amp;nbsp;(There are some caveats, and things
might be improving, but let&amp;#8217;s not be too hopeful.) &amp;nbsp;Greg (and now I, as
well) hunger for&amp;nbsp;quantitative&amp;nbsp;data on this subject. &amp;nbsp;Philosophy plus
experimentally determined numbers equals science, and now we are getting&amp;nbsp;somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the symphony tonight, this situation struck me as analogous to almost
every issue I could dream up. &amp;nbsp;For instance, this has a fractal effect
in science. &amp;nbsp;Say you measure the&amp;nbsp;temperature, you don&amp;#8217;t really know the
value unless it has some associated error (fractal depth: 1). &amp;nbsp;But then
how are you sure that the error is correct (fractal depth:&amp;nbsp;2+).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the most&amp;nbsp;intriguing&amp;nbsp;corollary&amp;nbsp;is &lt;strong&gt;sexual identity&lt;/strong&gt; (or how
one expresses one&amp;#8217;s self by who one is attracted&amp;nbsp;to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot classify who I am&amp;nbsp;attracted&amp;nbsp;to. &amp;nbsp;No matter what I do, there
always seems to be an exception to any rule I lay down. &amp;nbsp;(I&amp;#8217;ll spare you
the juicy details.) &amp;nbsp;However, if you show me someone, or if I interact
with someone, I can come up with a decision on whether the subject at
hand &amp;#8216;does it&amp;#8217; for me or not. &amp;nbsp;Moreover, I have no idea how to go about
determining a suitable sexy-to-Anthony metric, since all prior attempts
have failed. &amp;nbsp;The concept seems&amp;nbsp;fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So similarly, to a software developer, give me a person and their code
and I can tell you if I think they are good or not. &amp;nbsp;Yet, I find the
abstract task hard, unsatisfying, and probably a waste of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s take the sexual&amp;nbsp;identity analogy one step further. &amp;nbsp;If we were to
sex operating systems, we would probably say that Windows more male,&amp;nbsp;and
Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X is more female. Of course, what we are doing here is actually
making a woman/man&amp;nbsp;gender&amp;nbsp;assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This makes Linux&amp;nbsp;transgendered!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the analogy breaks down when you start to talk about
solutions in these two spaces. &amp;nbsp;Gender bias probably won&amp;#8217;t be solved (in
the short term) simply by decreasing the market share of the major
players. &amp;nbsp;Additionally, unless you are Richard Stallman, you aren&amp;#8217;t just
born an&amp;nbsp;open-source-sexual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think most people are forced to believe simply because it collapses
their information entropy to zero. &amp;nbsp;Sadly, I don&amp;#8217;t know how to break
them of this habit, or even if I&amp;nbsp;should.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#8220;the City that Oil built.&amp;#8221; I have experienced a strong correlation
between such liquid markets, the willingness for people to live in
underground tunnels, and the general lack of vegan&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downtown Houston is a weird place. &amp;nbsp;It never seems busy though one may
saunter through the avenues framed by monolithic buildings.
&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;architecture is grandiose and diverse. &amp;nbsp;But you have to wonder who
lives in these constructs if you are the only one on the&amp;nbsp;street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day, the city is teeming with life. &amp;nbsp;Like white blood cells
they&amp;nbsp;traverse the internal&amp;nbsp;circulatory&amp;nbsp;infrastructure. &amp;nbsp;Exiting the
anonymous hall&amp;#8217;s glassy dermis for any length of time must be death for
these oxygen-carrying modula. &amp;nbsp;Unless, of course, it is their smoke&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/p&gt;

on the number of columns that you can store in a single&amp;nbsp;table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, if you hit this limit for some reason, it indicates that &amp;#8216;you are
doing it wrong.&amp;#8217; &amp;nbsp;However, this is not always the&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, say you want to store some information that is a function
of isotope. &amp;nbsp;Well, exist some 3000+ nuclides that are known to exist in
nature. &amp;nbsp;If you want to store this data in a single table and your
database allows 4096 columns per table, you are in luck! &amp;nbsp;However, if
you go down by a single power of two, there are only 2048 columns per
table and you are in&amp;nbsp;trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of different table structures and their implicit table&amp;nbsp;limits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/column-count-limit.html"&gt;MySQL 5&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;4,096&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143432.aspx"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSSQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;1,024&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14237/limits003.htm"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;1,000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/excel-specifications-and-limits-HP005199291.aspx"&gt;Excel 2003&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;256&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;NumPy:&amp;nbsp;+inf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s right; NumPy structured (or record) arrays seem to allow as many
columns as you can fit into memory! &amp;nbsp;Below is some code that
demonstrates this. &amp;nbsp;I tested it up to a million columns, but I am
certain that it could handle a few more orders of&amp;nbsp;magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation is peculiar since traditional databases are limited by
disk size, not memory, like NumPy. &amp;nbsp;(HDDs, of course, being much larger
than&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="go-to-the-source"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go to the&amp;nbsp;Source&lt;/h2&gt;

the full-body scanners and backscatter x-ray machines at airports
harming pregnant&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am all for women, and mostly for pregnancy. &amp;nbsp;But I am also for, you
know,&amp;nbsp;quantitative science and the lowly photon. &amp;nbsp;Here are some &lt;em&gt;fun
facts&lt;/em&gt; that we should all&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The radiation dose you receive from full body scanners (0.005 - 0.01
mrem) is about ten thousand times less than want you experience on an
annual basis just by living on Earth (360 mrem). Moreover it is 100
times less than your yearly dental x-rays (1 - 20 mrem). In fact, you
will be subjected to a much higher radiation exposure on the plane
flight itself than you&amp;nbsp;receive&amp;nbsp;by going through the&amp;nbsp;scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real issue with these heinous machines is privacy, not safety (even
to a&amp;nbsp;fetus).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above website hosts a pretty neat app that lets you determine how
&amp;#8216;walkable&amp;#8217; your neighborhood is. &amp;nbsp;It is a great example of the kind of
analysis that you can do when you have a huge amount of data available.
&amp;nbsp;For instance, geolocation information on every bus route, bike path,
park, and retail store in&amp;nbsp;America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, the score that your home address gets is only as good as the
algorithm applied to the&amp;nbsp;database.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since where I live gets a &amp;#8220;Walker&amp;#8217;s Paradise&amp;#8221; 91/100 score, I am
inclined to believe in their methodology. &amp;nbsp;In fact, they claim that only
3% of Austinites live in a more walk-able part of town. &amp;nbsp;The only
neighborhoods that beat me out are the University of Texas itself and
Downtown. &amp;nbsp;It is no wonder I don&amp;#8217;t want to&amp;nbsp;move&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the site also claims that Houston is more walkable than Austin,
which is patently false. &amp;nbsp;So I am inclined to not believe their&amp;nbsp;algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How I think that they came to this outrageous conclusion is that they
count the number of walkable neighborhoods, not taking into account the
percent of people or the area that these neighborhoods actually cover.
&amp;nbsp;I think this is why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; also beats Houston. &amp;nbsp;Such huge metropolises may
contain some very walkable areas, but as a whole they are impossible to
traverse by foot. &amp;nbsp;This is not the case in Austin, even though it is a
tenth of the&amp;nbsp;size.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, have I got a post
for&amp;nbsp;you&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EIA&lt;/span&gt;, as mentioned before, houses monolithic databases on energy
generation and consumption in this country. One of them goes by the
affectionate name Form &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RW&lt;/span&gt;-859 , or the Nuclear Fuel Data&amp;nbsp;Survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this database is a record of every fuel assembly to ever
come out of a commercial nuclear reactor in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. It contains
information such as where the fuel is being stored, if the fuel form
failed, the mass of the assembly, and when the reactor was operating.
&amp;nbsp;(Unfortunately, my version of the survey contains data only up until
2002, so I am missing eight years of&amp;nbsp;history.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, good ol&amp;#8217; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RW&lt;/span&gt;-895 also contains some interesting neutronic data,
such as the inital U-235 enrichment [w/o, weight percent] of each
assembly as well as the burnup [MWd/kg]. &amp;nbsp;In some sense, the enrichment
is a measure of how much energy you &lt;strong&gt;*expect*&lt;/strong&gt; to get out of the fuel
and the burnup is a measure of how much energy you &lt;strong&gt;*did*&lt;/strong&gt; get out of
the&amp;nbsp;fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the above two pieces of information and my burnup-criticality
model, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nukestar.me.utexas.edu/scopatz/Bright/"&gt;Bright&lt;/a&gt;, I calculated the isotopic composition and
multiplication factor of every fuel assembly at discharge (the time when
the fuel is&amp;nbsp;permanently&amp;nbsp;removed from the reactor). &amp;nbsp;This data was then
stored in a couple of different databases: one for immediately after
discharge and one for time &amp;#8216;now&amp;#8217; in which the fuel was allowed to cool
down since it was&amp;nbsp;removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want, you can take a peak at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://nukestar.me.utexas.edu/scopatz/FuelLearning/"&gt;my databases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scopatz/FuelLearning"&gt;the code
that generated them&lt;/a&gt;. (As you may have guessed by the directory names
here, this was done for a collaborator to try and apply machine learning
algorithms to used fuel&amp;nbsp;assemblies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I rant too much further, I should define the reactivity of a fuel
assembly. &amp;nbsp;If &amp;#8216;k&amp;#8217; is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_multiplication_factor"&gt;multiplication factor&lt;/a&gt;, then the reactivity
&amp;#8216;rho&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\huge&amp;amp;space;\rho&amp;amp;space;=&amp;amp;space;\frac{k-1}{k}" /&gt;Thus, reactivities greater than one mean that the fuel still
has some &amp;#8216;juice&amp;#8217; in it, while values less than one mean that the fuel
has to rely on the sweet juice of other fuel&amp;nbsp;elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are anything like me, you may idly wonder what the mass-weighted
reactivity of the whole of the nuclear fuel cycle over the past 40 years
has been. &amp;nbsp;This would give you, Oh Intuitive Reader, some idea of how
efficient our system is at actually generating the energy it says it is
going to. &amp;nbsp;Look. No.&amp;nbsp;Further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The mass-weighted average discharge reactivity is:&amp;nbsp;-0.1083&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! The above number is negative. &amp;nbsp;If it was positive, this would be
like throwing out batteries after only using them part&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;But how can this number be negative? Zero charge seems like it would
be the lowest you could go&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; I hear your cries. &amp;nbsp;This is where the
battery analogy falls apart. &amp;nbsp;The answer lies in the secret of
batch-averaging, which deserves its own&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, isn&amp;#8217;t the distribution of these&amp;nbsp;reactivities useful to know
too? &amp;nbsp;I can&amp;#8217;t deny you, Friendly&amp;nbsp;Reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/TOAgjQBKL5I/AAAAAAAAF0U/ufqsJW_Xw5o/discharge_reactivity.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

w00tstock&amp;nbsp;2.9&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fine, this is sort of a serious kind of middle of the road sort of
interactive web log-ish thing. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;#8217;ll do the pundit dance for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the election was a complete disaster&amp;#8230;or was it?! &amp;nbsp;While not
a sympathizer, I am a Tea Party&amp;nbsp;empathizer. &amp;nbsp;Even the most liberal of
publications, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/11/mid-term_madness"&gt;the Economist&lt;/a&gt;, feels some amount of&amp;nbsp;kinship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;#8230;in how many other countries would a powerful populist movement
demand less of government, rather than endlessly and expensively
more?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are legitimate problems in this country and people are genuinely
upset at the dysfunctional incumbent government. &amp;nbsp;At its heart, the Tea
Party is an anti-establishment movement. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately for the rest of
us, their platform falls off after this central&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long time supporter of third party solutions, I am pleased that
&lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; other than the Republicans &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Democrats is doing well. &amp;nbsp;I just
wish they offered actual solutions. &amp;nbsp;If not masturbating would solve
poverty or keep people in their homes or implement a carbon tax, where
do I sign&amp;nbsp;up?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it is all hocus pocus witch is about as effective as Nazairte
vows. &amp;nbsp;Instead, what we purchased with our vote is a House divided. &amp;nbsp;I
doubt that health care reform can do much for this lame&amp;nbsp;duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more disturbing than the ousted incumbents were the ones that
remained in office. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/03/nevada-election-results-2010_n_765994.html"&gt;Harry Reid kept his seat&lt;/a&gt;, even though his
environmental record &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; a load of toxic nuclear waste! &amp;nbsp;And how in
the hell did Rick Perry remain&amp;nbsp;Governor of the great state of Texas? &amp;nbsp;He
was basically caught embezzling from the State while&amp;nbsp;simultaneously
refusing to accept Federal stimulus money. &amp;nbsp;And dear lord, Jerry Brown.
&amp;nbsp;I guess he isn&amp;#8217;t going to wholesale auction off California, but I am a
firm believer in term&amp;nbsp;limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who cares? &amp;nbsp;Really? &amp;nbsp;When I wake up and peddle to work tomorrow, all
I will see is a glorious bubble. &amp;nbsp;I live in Austin, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.statesman.com/news/local/austins-core-carried-bond-proposal-to-win-1019153.html"&gt;now with bike&amp;nbsp;paths!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

the &amp;#8216;Rally to Restore Fear and/or Sanity&amp;#8217; in Washington &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was more
by providence that I went than&amp;nbsp;specifically desiring to participating in
a faux political event hosted by a cable television&amp;nbsp;channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in the District, where people still don&amp;#8217;t have the right to vote,
for of all things a Department of Energy meeting. &amp;nbsp;Is the irony leaking
through this series of tubes&amp;nbsp;yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the rally was fun. &amp;nbsp;The show was entertaining enough; you can
watch that online. &amp;nbsp;But from the steps of the National Gallery, the
gathering was more about entertaining&amp;nbsp;signage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event started out well with a poster&amp;nbsp;stating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Repeal &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law"&gt;Godwin&amp;#8217;s Law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course there was no shortage of the&amp;nbsp;hard-to-disagree-with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Only Hitler was Hitler&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in&amp;nbsp;apparent&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;reference to Glen Beck&amp;#8217;s penchant for declaring everyone he
disagrees with a Nazi. &amp;nbsp;(So&amp;nbsp;pervasive&amp;nbsp;is his&amp;nbsp;obsession&amp;nbsp;that even &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/10/his_struggle?page=1"&gt;the
Economist&lt;/a&gt; takes&amp;nbsp;heed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar truism was a giant piece of cardboard that must have been 5 x
7 feet, supported by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVC&lt;/span&gt; pipe, blocked everyone&amp;#8217;s view, and&amp;nbsp;read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Front:&lt;/strong&gt; This Sign is Too Damn Big&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIGN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were more explicitly political ones in the mix as well. &amp;nbsp;Melding
both&amp;nbsp;poignancy&amp;nbsp;and wit was a young woman who proudly&amp;nbsp;exclaimed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I Masturbate to Christine O&amp;#8217;Donnell&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever floats your witch, lady&amp;#8230; &amp;nbsp;(All the good ones seem to sink. &amp;nbsp;I
feel&amp;nbsp;cheated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the most righteous one was held by a (presumably) Saudi woman
who was wearing a&amp;nbsp;chromatic flower lei. &amp;nbsp;The sign itself had a quarter
rainbow, starting and ending in clouds, &amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
God Loves Fags&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched her take a picture flanked by two men who each had posters&amp;nbsp;declaring&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Don&amp;#8217;t Deport My Husband!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#8217;t even think of it&amp;#8230; &amp;nbsp;And lest you think that the rally itself
was devoid of nerds, I found this gem in the trash outside of the
Canadian&amp;nbsp;embassy:&lt;/p&gt;

Americans for Gaussian Distributions&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is a platform I can get&amp;nbsp;behind!&lt;/p&gt;

Development meeting in Washington &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; (Gaithersburg, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt; really), there
has been a lot of talk about the &amp;#8220;Fuel Cycle&amp;nbsp;Simulator Grand&amp;nbsp;Challenge.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand this is very, very exciting. &amp;nbsp;It is an&amp;nbsp;opportunity for
the DoE to replace a system that doesn&amp;#8217;t work. &amp;nbsp;Or at the very least, it
is a workflow that does not meet current and expected needs. &amp;nbsp;I have
been saying this for&amp;nbsp;years&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;Another thing I have been saying for years is that, &amp;#8216;Good science is
good software development.&amp;#8217; &amp;nbsp;Not everyone believes me; fine. &amp;nbsp;But if you
are going to build out a huge code infrastructure you may as well give
it the old college&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fearful though. &amp;nbsp;They are calling it a &amp;#8216;Grand Challenge&amp;#8217; because
there exists&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;permeating&amp;nbsp;belief&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuclear engineers are not software&amp;nbsp;developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This problem is&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This problem is&amp;nbsp;new.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the proposed&amp;nbsp;simulator&amp;nbsp;is classic framework problem that
is easily solved by a Model-View-Controller (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MVC&lt;/span&gt;) approach with good
test-driven&amp;nbsp;development around the physical models. &amp;nbsp;And they are far
from the first scientists to have a issue with storing and
visualizing&amp;nbsp;large amounts of&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fearful because if they choose the wrong &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; now, it will have
effects for years and years to come. &amp;nbsp;(Thankfully, from experience, they
seem to recognize&amp;nbsp;this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also fearful because they are talking about a three-year time frame
just to build the framework and maybe some sample physics models [1].
This is the easy part! &amp;nbsp;And every day that you spend debating whether
you should be passing an array or a pointer to an array is a day that
you are not doing new science and engineering&amp;nbsp;[2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am excited because it truly is an excellent idea. &amp;nbsp;I am just not
sure that it is as VISIONary as they make it out to be. &amp;nbsp;Give me three
months, a coffee-shop, and &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;#8217;ll have the&amp;nbsp;architecture that
has been&amp;nbsp;proposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real grand challenge is making nuclear engineers into become
software&amp;nbsp;developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]:&lt;/strong&gt; It may well take three years to put in meaningful models, but
that is science not&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[2]:&lt;/strong&gt; I count views as new science, because without the shiny
figure at the end, all you have is a bunch of&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to Starbucks to try to buy my overpriced dinner. &amp;nbsp;Here was the

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Me: &amp;nbsp;No thanks, it is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;[No need for more bags, right?]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Barista: Would you like a fork for your fruit cup?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Me: No thank you. &amp;nbsp;[I have a bamboo utensil kit in my luggage.]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Barista: Are you sure you don&amp;#8217;t need a bag?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Me: Yes, thank you though.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe peeps in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt; just *really* like bags and plastic forks. &amp;nbsp;I
can&amp;#8217;t say as I blame&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;#8217;t been particularly good at communicating. It is
getting to me even; I have felt disconnected. I didn&amp;#8217;t even log into my
email for several days, waiting until I had something good to write.
Life has been an emotional steamroller, slowly compressing my innards
onto the hot, black pavement&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; So my mom was hospitalized the day after I returned to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt;.
This was her 7th or 8th Emergency Room visit in 6 weeks and her second
hospital admittance. Most of the rest of this time I was deep in finals
week. Then, when she went in this latest time I was stuck in The Valley
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;) and couldn&amp;#8217;t escape until the next&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIAGNOSIS&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; My mom had several issues going on simultaneously which
made finding and treating any of them difficult. What it looks like it
came down to was a Urinary Tract Infection (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTI&lt;/span&gt;) coupled with Sciatica
(a pinched nerve in her lower spinal column). [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: she did not have
Cirrhosis as previously reported, stupid Google&amp;nbsp;autocompletion].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, all of the pain medicines they were giving her were cut
with acetaminophen, so she didn&amp;#8217;t have a fever. Which meant she was
asymptomatic for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTI&lt;/span&gt;. And since she has only the one kidney, this
infection put her in even more pain and a whole lot of&amp;nbsp;danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also due to her strange biology, she was hypersensitive to the pain that
the Sciatica was causing. This caused her first doctor to tell her that
she was faking it, it was all in her head, and to &amp;#8220;Shut Up&amp;#8221; when she was
crying and moaning. He then proceeded to treat her with two conflicting
anti-psychotics. Consider that asshole&amp;nbsp;fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of this 6+ week period, she probably ate only the
equivalent of 10 meals and slept close to 30 hours. Yes, she was only
able to get 30 minutes of sleep a day while simultaneously on Vicodin,
Valium, and Morphine. Restlessly wasting away was not helping the
healing&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SECOND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RELEASE&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; She was released again only a few days ago. The
treatment for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTI&lt;/span&gt; is an easy course of wide spectrum antibiotics.
The treatment for the Sciatica was a cortisone shot to the nerve in her
spine. Unfortunately, the shot takes 2-3 days to kick in. Friday was the
first day that she was really up and at &amp;#8216;em&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this is will be at least a semi-permanent fix. We&amp;#8217;ll see what
the good doctor says&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain. I was chasing my Papa around the beach, through the
tents and the recumbent chairs. He was dapperly dressed and riding an
electric bicycle, never looking back. He died five years&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom&amp;#8217;s father was the one who escaped. By some miracle, his entire
immediate family made it out of Germany right before they would have
been sent to the death&amp;nbsp;camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As survivors, my family&amp;#8217;s existential crises are somewhat different than
most peoples. Most people, to stay sane, believe that if history had
been slightly different then they themselves would be slightly
different. I, however, know that if things had been a little off I would
not exist. There would be no me to speak of. Survival is a lot hard
work, the will to make it, and a little&amp;nbsp;luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last point is what was driven home this weekend. Papa and his older
brother had always refused to talk about their experiences. &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Why do you
want to know that?! It&amp;#8217;s ancient history&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; What we do know is that
after they escaped, the two boys went &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; over to Germany as spies
for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Army Air Force. To us children and grandchildren this means
that we are of that rare breed of Jew that not only survived. We managed
to actively fight&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several strange and unexplained artifacts were found when we cleaned out
his place, post-mortum. But that is where the information&amp;nbsp;ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, my mom spoke with my Great Uncle Kurt, my grandfather&amp;#8217;s brother.
Apparently, November 8th 1933(?) is the anniversary of their escape. We
were always told that they got on one of the last boats to leave in
1939. This is not quite&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncle Kurt, on the same day decades later, told my mom that my Great
Grandfather Gaston was friends with a member of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt; man was
so fond of Gaston that a few days before my family was supposed to be
rounded up, he told my Great Grandfather to get his family out of the
country. His daughter, my now deceased Great Aunt Erica, was already
living in&amp;nbsp;Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than this, this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SS&lt;/span&gt; fellow let Gaston, his wife, and his sons
hide out in his house for four days before they themselves made their
escape to France. For now, the story ends there as Uncle Kurt did not
want to go over any more on the&amp;nbsp;phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is it. My story is now more similar to the hundreds of others that
managed to hide out. I owe my life, every day, to the kindness of a
stranger. I owe it to the un-patriotism of someone who couldn&amp;#8217;t be more
in the establishment. I owe it to the network. It is all about who you
know, and when. I owe it to being&amp;nbsp;likable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#8217;t just fight back, we were also supremely lucky. I don&amp;#8217;t know
why my grandfather refused to look back at me in my dream. I don&amp;#8217;t know
what that means. I just want to catch his&amp;nbsp;memory.&lt;/p&gt;

For some stupid reason a conference paper
draft deadline was at midnight.. So guess who got to work 12 hours that
day. I submitted the paper at 10:45pm. Needless to say, it did not leave
a lot of time for&amp;nbsp;partying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the help of Anne, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Halloween09#"&gt;we did manage to salvage the night&lt;/a&gt;. We
carved a pumpkin, cooked the seeds, and then watched some Golden Girls.
As my ninja carrot friend in Madison consoled me later, &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;The Golden
Girls make everything right.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Su844NX1EAI/AAAAAAAAEQM/QXEO_XhUkg8/s400/pa310001.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But onto &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHY&lt;/span&gt; I was working all throughout my favorite secular holiday.
My future gets decided, soon. Which is very very stressful. For those of
you who didn&amp;#8217;t know, I am supposed to graduate from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UT&lt;/span&gt; in May. I am not
convinced that this will happen. Nor am I convinced that it will occur
by August (my adviser&amp;#8217;s revised date). In any case, the professors are
all making noises that it is coming&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a 95% chance that when I graduate, I leave Austin as well.&lt;/strong&gt;
Now what this means exactly is rather unclear. Where will I go? Who will
I work for? How much money will I make? Will I be in the country? At a
university? At a national lab? Will I move to a more technical track or
will I get slotted into policy? Will I still be collaborating with this
broadening research&amp;nbsp;group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer to these is, &amp;#8220;Fuck if I know&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; What ever happens, I
will probably be traveling as much as ever. So the 4+ months that I
spend outside of Texas will be flipped. I am probably going to be around
Austin at least a few weeks out of the year. One of those weeks you can
count your pretty pennies on (read:&amp;nbsp;Flipside).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the professors in my department recommended me trying to become
the one really technical policy nuclear engineer out there. He has an
interesting idea. I have the knack for it on all sides. And it is sort
of a non-standard gig, so I could probably really make a name for
myself. Which is essential for entering the world of Academe&amp;nbsp;proper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, no biggie right? No. I haven&amp;#8217;t had a face to face meeting with my
adviser in over a month. The ones we try to have keep getting moved
around and rescheduled. I have the (unjustifiable) feeling that he might
be avoiding me. I think that they call it&amp;nbsp;abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I have more than enough work to do. But I am getting nervous.
What are my contributions to the field going to be? Am I worth it? Can I
be a technical policy leader? What will that kind of prestige cost? Am I
willing to pay it? I know understand the phrase, &amp;#8220;Dare to&amp;nbsp;Dream&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dreams are&amp;nbsp;scary&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry that I missed Pallas. It sounds like those of you who went had a
really great time! Normally, I would be completely jealous. But instead
I was&amp;nbsp;here&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SuemA8al7VI/AAAAAAAAEHc/vJy0Ae2ChJA/s400/pa240005.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;having an equally good&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Madison rocks. Maybe not as hard nor as long as Austin does,
but it is still damn cool. I understand that my experience may be
atypical. I have many excellent friends here from several vectors. Also,
it is an escape where I can dedicate my time to programming. Which is
lovely. Most grad students spend the vast majority of their time doing
tasks extraneous to their actual research. So when you get a chance to
do what you are interested in you take&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has been my life here: 12-17 hours of research + 4 hours of hanging
out (drinking and eating cheese) + 3- 8 hours of sleep. It has been
bliss. I feel really at home here. A different home. It probably helps
that my co-worker here is from Belleville and Nakia is from&amp;nbsp;Madison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I am coming and staying home tomorrow. I&amp;#8217;ll get to be in one
place for 6 weeks! I am excited. I am also pleased to be leaving their
midwestern climes. I grew up with this and left it with purpose and
dedication. California had my graces for a decade, as does Texas&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything, I am looking forward to seeing my main squeeze Anne.
One more day and I promise I won&amp;#8217;t leave you anymore. This&amp;nbsp;semester.&lt;/p&gt;

Even my &amp;#8220;minimum once-a-week&amp;#8221;
rule has been shamelessly broken. My Google Reader is in a complete
disarray. I have been&amp;nbsp;busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now is the first night of a 10 day stint in Madison. It has
involved, keys, bike rides, meeting people, citywide WiFi, bourbon on
the rocks, and beer. Have I mentioned that I love this place yet? Fear
not AustiKnights, you are still bigger and have better weather. I was
really concerned that I would be completely burnt out by the time I got
up here and come to resent this trip, but so far I love&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course loving Madison requires &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/PumpkinPatch#"&gt;leaving the Pumpkin Patch behind&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Stu6YO3VeoI/AAAAAAAAECw/ItgaIJpvMWo/s400/pa170034.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;though supposedly drunken corn mazes are all the rage up here. (1
liter of Cranberry Juice and 1 liter of Vodka in a Camelbak, seriously?!
That is&amp;nbsp;fantastic.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that has all been in the last 2 and a half days. Before that I was
in the Bay Area. Someday I will live in my house. Can I hear it for&amp;nbsp;November?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing I have learned, there are a lot of fucking cool
people in America. All distilled separately, it proves hard to mix them.
Seems I&amp;#8217;ll just have to keep travelling and&amp;nbsp;sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise! Guess who had Swine&amp;nbsp;Flu?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sq0sptbGqQI/AAAAAAAAC_M/aeVzqmJw6i0/s400/p9090022.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least now I am back in the swing of things. I no longer feel
like death. Right well in time for me to run off to California and
Wisconsin this month. Woo&amp;nbsp;hoo&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major event I more or less missed due to illness were High Holy Days
this year. I sort of book-ended them. I went to the first day of Rosh
Hashanah and the concluding services for Yom Kippur. I was not well
enough to fast,&amp;nbsp;sadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than this, I didn&amp;#8217;t really get out apologies this year. I sent
out one email. To which I have yet to hear a response. Many of those
whom have received them in the past were not slated for them this year.
Which is good news. But a bunch of new people who didn&amp;#8217;t get them simply
won&amp;#8217;t. For better or worse, I have&amp;nbsp;turned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you felt like I owe you an apology, consider it granted. On the
other hand, if you feel like you have wronged me in the past, you are
now&amp;nbsp;forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems a bit antiseptic to do it in this blanket fashion, but hey! I
was really fucking sick. And as my mom told me, Swine Flu isn&amp;#8217;t even&amp;nbsp;Kosher!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exciting News!&lt;/strong&gt; So given the recent criticisms, I am going to tell
you about it in a short, encoded, and peevish&amp;nbsp;fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I was in Paris, my adviser and I had a meeting where we decided
that it would be good for me to spend some time north of the wall. It is
known that it is quite a magical land up there. Which is good since
previous attempts to befriend the majestic unicorn have been successful.
So it looks like this expedition is going to take place. It took a lot
of work to get this off the ground. After all, one does not simply
jumping stilts into&amp;nbsp;Mordor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the interim Super Secret Project 2 has come to a close. How
this affects the northern climes (not to mention where everyone loves
vagina) is unclear. It has also come to light that Duncan Idaho of House
Atreides has a made a similar passage to the one I am about to embark
upon. I expect an upset among expatriate Argentine&amp;nbsp;cowboys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike &lt;span class="caps"&gt;K. D.&lt;/span&gt; Lang (not my brother), Super Secret Project 2 is not +5.
Maybe it is -5. Maybe it is 0. Maybe it is +2.5. Still, I now have no
desire for lollipops nor hats worn by old ladies. Despite what you
believe, people&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sisyphus-like, we build. &amp;#8220;*Things fall apart; it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;scientific.*&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Paris was
much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The city, if done right, can
be quite pleasant. The conference was better than expected as well. I
even enjoyed one of the plenary sessions. The first panel was my Nuclear
Engineering dream team sans el&amp;nbsp;Baradei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Paris#"&gt;My photos can be found here.&lt;/a&gt; But by far the best experience I had
went as follows. Picture it, I had just had dinner with my co-worker, a
two crepe and coffee course, at a little place near the backside of
Notre Dame. She needed to get back to the hotel to prep for her talk the
next day. I had seen on the map &amp;#8220;Place Dauphine&amp;#8221; on the other end of the
island in the Seine on which that great cathedral sits. Being a Jeanne
d&amp;#8217;Arc fanatic, I was of course interested in a park dedicated to her
liege-lord. Is it right for a Jew to have a patron saint all picked out
(break glass in case of Catholicism)? Likely a topic that will take a
separate discourse to answer. It was 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way, I noticed at the rear of the church-under-remodel Cafe
Esmeralda and I said to myself &amp;#8220;Hah, you cannot trick me; I have read
Victor Hugo and know your little game.&amp;#8221; Further on I stopped and took
pictures of dramatically lit gargoyles. Then it&amp;nbsp;happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sq0s1caAA1I/AAAAAAAACxw/J5_3x4rwXYw/s400/p9090045.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turning the corner to the front of Notre Dame there were people. A lot
of people. A crowd. Even better this throng seemed to be dedicated to
the noble task of blowing bubbles. Had I just wandered into the best
flash mob ever?! Yes. Clearly, these were my&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, a large man with short black hair, a large black satchel,
wearing a black suit with a white shirt came by. He took a bubble vial
out of his bag and handed it to me. I knew what to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sq0s5Nu1mUI/AAAAAAAACyY/EWRu98b2Tv0/s400/p9090061.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;White dots in sky are bubbles reflecting the camera flash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But knowing only brings further questions. What was this all about?
Right as I was about to leave, after the photographs, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; cameras, and
inquisitive police, I saw her running around speaking perfect English.
&amp;#8220;Can I have another&amp;nbsp;bottle?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Carla got a second serving of the miracle stuff from our
provider, she ran off blowing with reinvigorated enthusiasm. Carla was
lithe and hyper-active. She wore classy black cargo pants, a black
sleeveless top, and a simple gold cross necklace. Her hair was Red. Char
Aznable red. The kind of dark/bright red that is in no way natural but cannot
be begrudged on those grounds. It was cropped short and tipped&amp;nbsp;black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I asked her what all the bubbles were about. &amp;#8220;Who knows?! I
was told it is a Celebration of Life!&amp;#8221; Check. We wandered through the
throng blowing bubbles for a bit longer. It turns out she is a
Neurobiology PhD student in Bonn and was in Paris for, what else, but an
international congress. Her English was so good because she had
previously spent 10 months working at an equestrian hospital in Oakdale,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; (near Sacramento). &amp;#8220;We should go see my co-workers.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;Mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next hour or so blowing bubbles and hanging out with these
four awesome German biology PhD students. They were all pretty neat. At
one point, they busted out beers from a small cooler they brought with
them. So now my canonical view of France is sitting in front of Notre
Dame, amongst babes and bubbles, complaining about Corona and the
superiority of darker&amp;nbsp;brews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it a function of my personality that I get into these situations? Or
is it my wacky life that has thoroughly skewed my persona? The chicken
is cooking scrambled eggs,&amp;nbsp;surely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point Carla asked me what I did for fun. &amp;#8220;This! Celebration of
Life,&amp;#8221; I answered. By now I had put together the obvious similarities
between the current situation and the Burner Community. Keeping it
simple I said, &amp;#8220;Have you hear of Burning Man?&amp;#8221; Her excitement was
palpable. She was unaware of any German burns, but her year in
California taught her what she needed to about what happens in the
desert. She wants to go, but it is that much more expensive with the
intercontinental&amp;nbsp;flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what she does for fun is analogous. She, somewhat obviously, is
into Metal. So she goes to all of the big European Metal concerts. So we
start talking about metal bands we like or have seen. I&amp;#8217;ve seen Tyr;
She has seen Dio; I am&amp;nbsp;jealous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This spawned a conversation between her and one of her co-workers about
what was actually good. If you have never seen two passionate Germans
argue about what &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; metal is, then you have not lived. Their focus
was only broken half-an-hour later when an androgynous French child in
desperate need of Ritalin ran by. Her/His disengaged parents were on the
other side of a shrubbery managing the one still in the&amp;nbsp;cradle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We supplied the kid with a bubble bottle. It&amp;#8217;s contents were quickly
dumped onto the ground after the little lips failed to produce the
desired soapy&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sq0tBEnB8-I/AAAAAAAACzo/9CQKhLMC0Zc/s400/p9090072.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in all of this the flash mob broke up. They were replaced by
drummers and a girl in Arabian pants spinning poi on the steps of Notre
Dame. The whirling balls of flame, naturally, attracted our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;
adoptee. When mein klein homunculus ran straight for the fire was the
only time I saw the mother step in and stop her&amp;nbsp;ward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting there, I thought to myself, &amp;#8220;Esmerelda&amp;nbsp;lives!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

Parisians. But generally things are quite nice. Perhaps it is the
excellent coffee that is lubricating my&amp;nbsp;attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

congress yesterday. And not completely blowing it equals success. When
you are the youngest, least accomplished person in the room by 20 years
(and all of the others present are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOE&lt;/span&gt; and foreign equivalent bigwigs),
the audience can be quite&amp;nbsp;imposing.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;#8217;t been getting enough work done recently. Today for
instance. I was going to spend the night programming after my
departmental function. But no. During the after-party at Crown &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Anchor,
I got shamefully drunk on a pint and a half of beer. This seems to be
happening a lot lately. If I eat what I normally eat (salad+) then I
can&amp;#8217;t drink how I used to drink. So I spent the rest of the night eating
and sleeping off a hangover. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAME&lt;/span&gt;. I am&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAME&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, this weekend was my first time fully cross dressing in public.
We went dancing on the pedestrian bridge over the river. Every article
down to my shoes (W40) was intended for women or not meant as clothing
(chain link belt). Sure, the shirt was given to me by a girl in North
Carolina, but it is a women&amp;#8217;s cut so it counts. For those of you not
here to enjoy&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, secret bonus third line item: Beanie for my birthday gave me two
pounds of coffee beans (yeah!). Which is frankly too much for me to
drink in any reasonable time frame. So I am thinking Chocolate Coffee
Cookies, anyone in? Just want to help me eat them? That is fine&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genderfuck"&gt;**Genderfuck:**&lt;/a&gt; The act of acquiring sexual dimorphic traits that
are not of one&amp;#8217;s own gender for the express purpose of parody. Ex.
Women wearing fake moustaches; Men with breasts, &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently introduced to the (formal) idea of genderfuck. Flipside
got me thinking about it even more. This summer I did my research.
Genderfuck offers a paradigm that explains and guides vast smears of my&amp;nbsp;sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HISTORY&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sort of genderfucky myself. Those of you who have known me for a
while know that I had very long hair until sometime late high school. I
was always teased or taken for a girl until sometime at the end of
middle school, when I could grow a beard. Even then if someone only saw
me from behind, I got &amp;#8220;Excuse me, Miss&amp;#8221; for a couple of more years. What
fewer of you know is that this had been happening since I was 3 months&amp;nbsp;old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Crazy Cashier: What a cute little girl! How old is she?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My Mother: It&amp;#8217;s a boy, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HE&lt;/span&gt; is three months old.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Crazy Cashier: Awww, what&amp;#8217;s her name?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My Mother: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIS&lt;/span&gt; name is Anthony!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Crazy Cashier: Hmmmm, &amp;#8216;Anthony&amp;#8217; is weird name for a girl&amp;#8230;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, apparently sometime in 2nd grade I would come home crying all the
time because I was being teased about looking like a girl. My parents,
who always let us choose what we wanted to look like, could no longer
handle it. They said that if I couldn&amp;#8217;t toughen up, my choice was gone.
They would forcefully cut my hair. Ever obstinate, I stopped crying. I
do not recall this series of&amp;nbsp;events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIRLFRIEND&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genderfucked is what I want my partner to be. Famously, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/2009/06/16/"&gt;earlier this
summer&lt;/a&gt; my cousin called me &amp;#8220;a fucking fetishist.&amp;#8221; Kinks often
establish themselves early. For instance, part of my reading this summer
took me to &amp;#8220;Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk&amp;#8221;. Intermediate Types
being early 20th century parlance for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGBT&lt;/span&gt; and Primitive Types being
ancient peoples (Greek, Asian, American, etc.) The following passage is
both the hottest thing in the world to me and how I would like to get&amp;nbsp;married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oCEKAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;dq=Intermediate+types+and+primitive+folk&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=b0QnSvGpVT&amp;amp;sig=eXkUqFBjBvj6BDvYengpk530tVs&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=AKSMSpy-N8egmAfd-bS0DQ&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=4#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=rushes&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;page 114s -&amp;nbsp;115,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;There appears to have been a curious custom in Sparta connected
with the ordinary marriage by capture which may be mentioned here as
suggesting some wavering so to speak at that time of the line
between male and female The bridegroom says Mueller brought the
young virgin having carried her off from the chorus of maidens or
elsewhere to the bride&amp;#8217;s maid who cut short her hair and left her
lying in a man&amp;#8217;s dress and shoes without a light on a bed of rushes
until the bridegroom returning from the public supper carried the
bride to the nuptial couch and unloosed her girdle. Whatever may
have been the exact meaning of this custom it almost suggests that
marriage by capture of women was preceded by marriage by capture of
youths [young men].&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am often accused of having a perverse and distasteful thing for
lesbians. But that couldn&amp;#8217;t be father from the truth. From a
Game-of-Life Theory standpoint why would I waste time lusting after
people who will never love me back? I want what I have requited,
heavily. Yes, I have been known to say that I have an attraction to the
&amp;#8216;Dyke Aesthetic&amp;#8217;, whatever that means. But I postulate that this is
because the canonical lesbian is genderfuck, not that I want to be with&amp;nbsp;lesbians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAGIC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;COUNTER&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, in all this thinking, I was fearful. What if &amp;#8216;genderfuck&amp;#8217; is
simply name-magic to make myself feel better about prior events? Am I in
danger of falling in love with a label and not a person? After some
further thought and discussion, I don&amp;#8217;t think&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, I was pointed to the framework of genderfuck being more of an
&amp;#8216;Anti-Label&amp;#8217; than a true descriptor. It is what you call someone who
fundamentally rejects imposed norms and gender binaries (labels) and is
willing to take a personal stand against them. But the (at least)
partial use of humour takes the immediate threat out of such opposition.
Genderfuck is about more than simply cross-dressing. It is
cross-dressing sans the intent to&amp;nbsp;deceive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly and personally, as a kink genderfuck is legitimized away from
&amp;#8216;label&amp;#8217; criticisms. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to make sense to anyone; it doesn&amp;#8217;t
even have to make sense to me. It is my deep seeded, emotionally charged
compulsion. Some people, for instance, have Centaur fetishes. I count my
lucky stars that mine actually exists. And therefore, it is not
unreasonable to ask that my sex partners indulge my fantasy in return
for me partaking in theirs to have a healthy&amp;nbsp;relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even though I may be crazy, at least I am still rational. We may&amp;nbsp;proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QUEER&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STRAIGHT&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my review of what genderfuck really is, I ran across &amp;#8220;Queer At Last?
Straight Intellectuals and the Desire for Transgression&amp;#8221; by Annette
Schlichter in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLQ&lt;/span&gt;. Did someone write a journal article about me before
we even met?! Ms Schlichter&amp;#8217;s paper had two main take away&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) The term &amp;#8216;queer&amp;#8217; is so general that it is possible to be a queer
straight. Queer merely means different. Thus it is possible to reject
heteronormativity while remaining heterosexual in&amp;nbsp;practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) However, queer straights, as demonstrated by self-identified people
in the literature, as a rule go through a transformation process whereby
they &amp;#8216;realize themselves to be queer.&amp;#8217; This transgression makes them not
truly queer. This is because, by analogy, the queer straight is in the
same position of any one who is a member of an oppressive majority,
though they may support a minority. For instance, a white person who
historically supported blacks does not suddenly become black. Nor does a
man who is a feminist become a woman. Unfortunately, they still stand on
the shoulders of implicit, systematic&amp;nbsp;privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, point (1) seems to apply, if I could be convinced to call myself
heterosexual. But point (2) means that there will be problems calling
myself a queer&amp;nbsp;straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But given my history, I am still queer. I never went through the type of
transformation that Ms Schlichter deftly outlines. I was raised queer so
there never was a need for a metamorphic period. Yes, this may be a
function of my freaky parents having their freaky children. An exception
even in the queer world. Pretty much every homo I have ever talked to
*knew* (often from quite early ages) that they were other-sexual. Same
with me, no alterations to identity required. At worst, I have the sort
of parents that little fag kids across the country spend the days
dreaming they had instead of their own ignorant and biased&amp;nbsp;set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I see my experience as being a source of major long-term
criticism for &amp;#8220;Queer at Last.&amp;#8221; The straight-who-becomes-queer may be a
myth. But as more and more non-traditional families are started, more
folk like me will pop up. I won&amp;#8217;t be alone in not really being
homosexual but not heteronormative either. My type will never replace
&amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; but maybe it will stop being&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Ms Schlichter does give us the ability to answer a persistent
question I receive. &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Why don&amp;#8217;t you just find some long-haired straight
girl who probably longs to be a tomboy and have her cut her hair?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; It
is for this transformation reason described. She isn&amp;#8217;t queer when I meet
her, so I am not interested. If she picks up on this (and this has
happened) she may cut her hair thinking to get close to me. But even
though I didn&amp;#8217;t enact the transformation she still didn&amp;#8217;t transgress.
And even if she had transgressed, she still took full advantage of her
heternormative privilege. She would be a facsimile of what I am really
interested in. The aesthetic does not give her the values nor the&amp;nbsp;experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXCEPTION&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*I forgot to mention this above.* Gays and lesbians and straights will
talk about those one or two special members of the sex that they are not
typically attracted to who really do it for them. By analogy, the same
is certainly true for me. There are a couple of &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; people out
there who completely turn my crank. But this is the exception, not the&amp;nbsp;rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, if the attraction is strong enough I try to establish some
basis for deviance in them that probably doesn&amp;#8217;t exist. Story time: my
middle school teacher (Ms Smit), my mother, and I were eating at a
restaurant. At the time, one of my friends was dating a girl (Meenon)
from the other middle school in the district. My mother and mentor
informed me the the girl in question was a complete babe/goddess. I
didn&amp;#8217;t see it nor understand it because her visage was fairly standard.
I have since come to understand that she solidly beats me in some
aspects of deviance, though it wasn&amp;#8217;t initially&amp;nbsp;apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if my first experience with someone was at a
burn-event, competitive art competition, gay club, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt;, or basically
anything else that has one putting on costumes and running around naked
in rain (happens more often than you&amp;#8217;d think), then I understand if you
have to play the normative card outside of such events to get by. I know
initially that you are something other than you seem. Personally, I feel
that I have been trending to a more respectable look to work in my more
conservative field. However, after I open my mouth it is all pretty much&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to go play dress-up, wanna&amp;nbsp;come?&lt;/p&gt;

got to Raleigh, and it was lovely! Here is how it all went&amp;nbsp;down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/strong&gt; After my meetings in the morning and afternoon, I went
and got a haircut in preparation&amp;nbsp;for&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Snpl6S4iZDI/AAAAAAAACdA/x2RuXgkQE20/s400/p8050042.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8230;when I went to get new glasses and a new prescription.
Unfortunately, the optomitrist was all booked up and so I had to come
back&amp;nbsp;on&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday:&lt;/strong&gt; After my morning workout routine. I was forever at the
optomotrists, but luckily, the girls who worked there were &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt;.
It was cookie Friday; I got some. Unfortunately, I was so late that I
didn&amp;#8217;t get to spend a lot of time working. Shabbat was upon us. I could
have been a bad kid and worked on. But I had seen some flyers and read
some blogs. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newraleigh.com/articles/archive/love-bug-the-great-bug-draw-off-art-exhibit/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOVE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was calling out to me. Not really understanding
what it was, I went back to the hotel to freshen up before heading to
the 101 Lounge, downtown, for the Great Bug Draw&amp;nbsp;Off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &amp;#8220;Love Bug&amp;#8221; turned out to be was a timed, competitive, spectator art
show for charity. So at the outside bar of the lounge, they lined up
artists who had tags on their backs like marathon runners. There were
two preliminary rounds of 25 minutes where, in their chosen medium,
local artists would scramble to produce bug-related art on 8 x 10 cards
as fast as they could. Each time one was done, a moderator would lift it
up, show the crowd, and then walk it inside. Most cards were sold before
they left the stand; each was $25. The crowd often pushed into the
street. The artists from each session who sold the most were advanced to
the last round of 15 mins in which larger more elaborate pictures were
created. All the proceeds benefited non-profit &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.toxicfreenc.org/"&gt;Toxic Free &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whose
stated goal is to remove dangerous chemicals from the hands of children.&amp;nbsp;Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is this important? Well, the 101 lounge certainly made a killing
selling bug-based drinks like the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2100835_bees-knees-cocktail.html"&gt;Bee&amp;#8217;s Knees&lt;/a&gt;. But what to note is
that, while there was a swarm outside, more discerning folk would see
that the lounge had two stories! And large portrait windows all around.
One side, naturally, was basically right above the bar where the
worker-artists were humming away. So the queen seats in the house were
inside, upstairs looking down perfectly on the art and the people. This
is where the story&amp;nbsp;starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the other queens enjoying such a visage, were a group of friends.
Girls+. Sometimes some of them would go downstairs and communicate with
the low-lying subjects in random-seeming walks. In any event, it was
fairly clear that the binaries and norms of the colonial subjects were
at least &lt;em&gt;questioned&lt;/em&gt; from such great heights. After all, there is more
than one way to make&amp;nbsp;honey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woefully friendless in Raleigh prior to this point, I rectified my
situation by spending a few hours casually chatting with this
interesting bunch. Thereby proving I was not some sort of owl or bat or
bullfrog. I was invited to go see the opening of a photography exhibit
at one of their coffee shops. They were tragic pieces in Black and White
biographing the lives of local&amp;nbsp;homeless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to say &amp;#8220;Goodbye Forever&amp;#8221; after this, we exchanged&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday:&lt;/strong&gt; Shawn, who has moved to Maryland for graduate studies,
stopped by for the day. We hung out, went downtown. Had dinner. Checked
out their ridiculous live music in the park. We walked around and saw
all of the civil buildings (Raleigh is the capital recall). Both of us
wanting to drink more, but me having driven, we go and hit up a couple
of euphemistically named liquor stores (&amp;#8220;Campus Beverages&amp;#8221;) and a
Kroger. Porter, Sauvignon Blanc, cherry ice cream, and whipped cream in
hand, it hits&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sn-mM44k5uI/AAAAAAAACi4/5BW4FQT_Qc4/s400/p8080043.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if we take the &amp;#8216;root&amp;#8217; out of Root Beer Float?&lt;/em&gt; A bottle of wine
and Beer Floats later, Shawn and I were nicely toasted. We spend the
rest of the evening entertaining ourselves on the Onion and&amp;nbsp;Craigslist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday:&lt;/strong&gt; Shawn and I head over to this delicious brunch place,
southern style. Humid as boring sin, we sit outside in the heat. We go
back to the hotel and sit off brunch for a bit. This is in preparation
for going over to the mall across the thoroughfare and walking it off as
well. We come back to the hotel and try to watch old stand up comedy on
Netflix, but it fails. Shawn leaves me and Raleigh behind as he must
need be in Lexington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VA&lt;/span&gt; that night. I go over to one of my favourite
haunts in town and order my new favourite: cafe meiele. Somewhere in the
middle of writing a paper outline, one of my new found friends calls&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! That was fast; I planning on calling or texting them to try to hang
out on Wednesday if I hadn&amp;#8217;t heard back. They were inviting me to a
smore cookout / storytelling extravaganza. It was a very subtle blast.
Suffice to say that I learned things about squid reproduction and sea
cucumber survival tactics that I had never known before. Stop me if
you&amp;#8217;ve heard this&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I am here, back in my hotel room, smoke seeped into my hair. But
present in such a way that I feel absolutely free. I&amp;#8217;ve got my Status
Back,&amp;nbsp;Baby.&lt;/p&gt;

and dangerous&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNC&lt;/span&gt;, as he is known online, writes like words don&amp;#8217;t matter. His pacing
makes prose seem poetry. He capitalizes nouns that deserve to be
capitalized, not just ones that normally get the treatment. His abject
neglect of quotation marks will leave you&amp;nbsp;reeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Snplcy3j0gI/AAAAAAAACeU/mVFRBKUBZwk/s400/p7030014.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it is his memoir of growing up in Baltimore and somehow
surviving the crack epidemic, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;, and his super-human vegan, Vietnam
Vet, ex-Panther leader father. Add on this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s status as the awkward,
Dice-throwing nerd and you gain an unrivalled&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to spoil the book for anyone, because you really must
read it yourselves. But I am going to reflect on some of the basic
themes. He talks a lot about having Knowledge and being a Conscious
person. Concisely, this is the knowledge that you will always be judged
by your looks and conscious that your heritage and birthright are the
very things that will forever put you in harms way. But more than this,
it is knowing that a better world can be made, built for you and yours.
Maybe not today, maybe not this generation even. It not an overly
hopeful message. It is knowledge that we were&amp;nbsp;slaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s father struggled to teach this to his children. In spite of their
ignorance and apathy, in opposition to their surroundings, to make them
into Conscious Individuals. In many ways this exemplifies the analogies
between Blacks and&amp;nbsp;Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think every religiously Jewish child grows up Conscious. If they
didn&amp;#8217;t get the message, there was something wrong with the teachers.
Even the strictly culturally Jewish have a budding awareness of
Knowledge. They are keen to the fact the even though their
great-grandfather may have been Jewish, they themselves would have been
sent to a Death&amp;nbsp;Camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jews, as a scholarly people, tend to approach the Knowledge
academically. Which frankly hasn&amp;#8217;t done wonders for our survival rate.
Diaspora works, and if it isn&amp;#8217;t broken why fix it? But the Knowledge
comes through. We were slaves. I was a slave. I am a slave. As long as
there is oppression. We have been shambling in our manacles since
Exodus. Struggling, hoping to free ourselves and others. Sometimes some
of us get stupid. But there we are, chain ganged to our mothers and our
fathers; our family promise a whip through the&amp;nbsp;ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It strikes me as more than coincidence that the same things that tie me
to my People also tie me to a little black boy growing up in the skids
of Baltimore a decade before I was&amp;nbsp;born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you who grew up with me may recall my rants against White people
and privilege. How could I even consider being attracted to someone who
stands on the systematic marginalization of my family, since before
Mathematics existed or History was invented. In the wake of that great
un-discussable, how could I love those who made my grandparents crazy,
who made my parents crazy, who made me crazy. The Klan was active not a
few blocks from my childhood&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents nodded. They understood. They taught me not to Hate. But this
wasn&amp;#8217;t Hate. This was wanting a safe place. A place where I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be
constantly confronted by the crazy past, by the nonsensical now. Every
side walk and manicured lawn was the product of the theft of my blood
and ashes. Holocaust dialogue is Never Again. The unspoken message is
When. Each Yiddishe kid worth two buttons asks themselves, my childhood
raped? Will I be an Adult? Will I be&amp;nbsp;prepared?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNC&lt;/span&gt; most certainly had it harder than I did. But the values are the
same. Reading &amp;#8220;The Beautiful Struggle&amp;#8221; was like reading an alternate
version of my youth. In fact, it was closer to what my mother
experienced, sans the nerd. But there is a lot of Truth in what he
writes. So even if you are the progeny of the great oppressor classes, I
think you&amp;#8217;ll still gain some gem of wisdom by reading&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

problems I was having with my research. Right now, I am doing
uncertainty analysis and I was getting results whose error was seven
orders of magnitude greater than the actual data value. Clearly this is&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I used the following analogy to get across the problem to my mom: &amp;#8220;It
is like thinking you have one M&amp;amp;M, you know, plus or minus 10 million&amp;nbsp;M&amp;amp;Ms.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom: &amp;#8220;Yikes! That is a lot of&amp;nbsp;variance!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;#8220;Yup&amp;#8230;And what I&amp;#8217;d really like is one M&amp;amp;M plus or minus half an&amp;nbsp;M&amp;amp;M.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mom: &amp;#8220;So, give or take an&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;M&amp;#8217;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it was cute. I wonder if this is a good way to teach error
analysis. It worked seamlessly&amp;nbsp;here&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ya&amp;nbsp;Raleigh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe not so exuberant as all that. I have been here a couple of
weeks now, and have a couple of weeks left to go. I am painfully lonely
here, in addition to the overworked/undersexed status that usually
follows from graduate studies. Last year when I was here, my friend &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AJ&lt;/span&gt;
from high school was also out doing an internship. At the time I didn&amp;#8217;t
realize what this meant for my mental health. Normally, I am very good
on my own: two sigma better than average. However, the previous two
months of travel, going from seeing nearly everyone I have ever known to
nothing was too severe. It was a train running into a brick&amp;nbsp;wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the trend might be changing; the end is in sight. To combat said
loneliness, and think about something other than nuclear fuel cycle
error propagation, I went to an album release party for Raleigh-local
group &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.myspace.com/birdsofavalon"&gt;Birds of Avalon&lt;/a&gt;. I found out about this though my avid&amp;nbsp;blog-watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concert had two opening bands before Birds played. The first was
pretty decent. The second was some hybrid Indie-Punk, which frankly I
was not into at all. Punk should have some bite, rather than be about
your 4th of July weekend. And Indie-music, well I guess I don&amp;#8217;t care
enough to have an&amp;nbsp;opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds of Avalon, however, were great. Their material encompassed words
like &amp;#8216;Musicality&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Thoughtfulness&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;Presence&amp;#8217; and most of all,
&amp;#8216;Entertaining&amp;#8217;. Still, only one of their songs was truly spectacular,
and they saved it for&amp;nbsp;last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go into all of this because the venue was fairly interesting itself.
The Pour House (get it? beer, pour) has an extensive upstairs balcony
area that wrapped around two sides of the top of the building. From here
you can look down on the pit and the band. This upstairs is where it is
allowable to smoke. But the view makes it worth it. Basically I got an
eagle eye view of the drummers for the cost of putting up with a little
smoke. I loved it. At one point between the bands, this man Robin
started talking to me. Robin, Raleigh born and raised, could tell within
5 minutes (from my accent) that I wasn&amp;#8217;t local.&amp;nbsp;Damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other good news, though, my friend Shawn from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSB&lt;/span&gt; is going to visit
me next weekend. He is moving to Maryland for graduate school from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;
and I get the benefit of a visit. Awesome. And a week after that I am
outta&amp;nbsp;here!&lt;/p&gt;

silent film festival has been backlogged for a couple of weeks. But here
it is, finally, in an attempt to get it out of my To-Do&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.silentfilm.org/"&gt;San Francisco Silent Film Festival&lt;/a&gt; this year was spectacular. In
my brief three day visit to the city, I managed to see four&amp;nbsp;films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`The Gaucho`_ (1927):&lt;/strong&gt; Aside from being my &lt;em&gt;alma matter&amp;#8217;s&lt;/em&gt; mascot,
gauchos are the Argentine version of the more northern cowboy. I knew
that I wanted to see this film the moment saw it listed for the
festival. &amp;#8216;Douglas Fairbanks&amp;#8217; is a name that means less than it should
outside of the silent film crowd. Thankfully, Dougy-Baby didn&amp;#8217;t fail to&amp;nbsp;deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic plot goes as follows. Girl master thief (Lupe Velez) meets boy
master thief (the Gaucho, Douglas Fairbanks) and they fall in love. In
their raiding of small town antics, they get roped into saving a small
mountain shrine (the City of the Miracle) from a recent coup&amp;#8217;s dictator
whose lackeys were shaking the Church down from money. Apparently, the
plot occurred to Mr Fairbanks while visiting a similar shrine in the
French&amp;nbsp;countryside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Fairbanks aerobics were impressive as always. Watching the man
vault up and down buildings, on and off moving horses never seems to get
old. But the truly shocking thing to me was his mastery of the bola. The
bola is a weapon that is notoriously hard to learn. To master it takes
practice from early childhood. However, Fairbanks performs difficult
tricks with smooth ease. He even incorporates their usage into a&amp;nbsp;dance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nor should the utter competence of the leading lady be overlooked. Lupe
Velez was effectively the equal of her male counterpart. The most
memorable moment for me of her was when she was locked up in a room. The
key was stuck in the door on the other side. She pushed a rug underneath
the door, used a pin to push the key out of the lock, the key fell onto
the rug, she dragged the rug buck under the door, used the key to unlock
the door, and walked out of the room. It was&amp;nbsp;brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome the dictators army currently garrisoned at the shrine, the
Gaucho causes a stampede of thousands of cattle and ushers them into the
city. This gives one of the most stunning shots of the film. When the
cattle first get to the city walls, they cram up against them until
their sheer mass breaks down brink and mortar. Then a flood of cow-flesh
pours over the wall. When I am old and grey, that is an image that I
will remember when I have forgotten all else. This movie was&amp;nbsp;fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Wild Rose`_ (1932):&lt;/strong&gt; I have trouble finding good things to say
about this movie. Not that it was bad, per se. I think fundamentally
when I sit down to see a movie, I want to be entertained. This is
probably a broader category for me than it is for most people; if I am
challenged or forced to think, I am&amp;nbsp;entertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said Wild Rose wasn&amp;#8217;t entertaining. It is supposed to be this big
paradigm shifting film for Chinese cinema. The director, Sun Yu, had
just returned from the United States (having learned cinematography) and
made this film. So maybe Yu&amp;#8217;s Chinese audience had never seen something
like this movie before. However, I swear I had seen some of his shots in
earlier films by Vertov and Chaplin and others. What was special was who
made it and who was watching it at the time, not the film itself. The
plot was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, but overloaded with nationalist sentiment. I understand
that some people really get off on such palpable propaganda, but I can&amp;#8217;t
stomach&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Underworld`_ (1927):&lt;/strong&gt; Easily my favourite film of the festival
this year. It was marginally better than &amp;#8220;The Gaucho&amp;#8221;. Billed to us as a
proto-noir, it was truly the essence of a gangster film. To get an idea
of how excellent this film was, it won the first ever Oscar for best
writing. The plot is roughly about the sordid affair of the manly bank
robber, criminal overlord Bull Weed, his girl Feathers, lawyer turned
bum turned henchman Rolls Royce, and the usual cast of side character
policemen and criminals. The movie is dark and funny, but never both at
the same time. Rather than trying to describe the movie further, here is
a poem I wrote about&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Underworld&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I saw a girl named Evelyn yesterday.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;She&amp;#8217;s dead now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;She died in 1975 and there is no going back.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Her skin turned black and white,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and Feathers were everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;She had a Rolls Royce,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;but never rode it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What did that hour buy you,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;you gregarious overgrowth of a man?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Did you polish the hard black body?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Do the ivory dressings now glisten in the night?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Draw a bad hand.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Reshuffle the deck.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The Police are here now&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;and Feathers are Everywhere!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Her head,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Evelyn&amp;#8217;s head, is too big. Was too big.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But maybe I am projecting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I am no more interested in women than a fancy car.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really should try and find a way to see this movie. Without
discussing it to much more, Rolls Royce has this excellent line when
Feathers first starts flirting with him. Even though Bull Weed is
absent, Rolls legitimately plays hard to&amp;nbsp;get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feathers says something like, &amp;#8220;I am not interested in books.&amp;#8221; To which
Rolls slyly responds, &amp;#8220;And I am not interested in&amp;nbsp;women.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience laughed. But there is an interesting historical point here.
&amp;#8216;Woman&amp;#8217; used here is a double entendre. The first meaning is the obvious
one, &amp;#8216;woman&amp;#8217; as in female human. The second use is &amp;#8216;woman&amp;#8217; as a
profession. So it is this second meaning that has since (thankfully)
fallen out of usage. But I think it is this second one that Rolls really
meant. Unlike Bull Weed, his character was not interested in having an
unthinking, sit-there-and-look-pretty&amp;nbsp;partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Aelita: The Queen of Mars`_ (1924):&lt;/strong&gt; This was a Soviet Russian
science fiction film. I had seen this one in Austin a few years prior so
I didn&amp;#8217;t bother seeing it again. I think I even made a post about it
back then, but I am having trouble finding it. In truth, I was a bit
disappointed. This was the first time that the Festival was screening a
film I had already&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Erotikon`_ (1929):&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8216;Erokikon&amp;#8217; was a Czech film discussing &amp;#8216;modern
female sexuality&amp;#8217;&amp;#8230;if you ignore the glaring plot holes. The story is
about a love pentagon. Basically, it follows this creepy (but handsome)
sleaze-ball, the two women who he has seduced, and their husbands. The
plot holes all revolve around the women. There is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REASON&lt;/span&gt; after the
first 20 minutes of the film for the women to ever even speak to the
creepy guy again. But for some reason, they see him and fall head over
heels once&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film was pretty good. The camera work had at least one toe in Avant
Garde. Which of course was awesome. Virginal sex where the camera is
placed on the bed, aimed upwards and pivoted. Splice in the picture of
Mary on the wall looking down on you, and my friends, you have one
awesome sex&amp;nbsp;scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than this though, I noticed that my facial features were similar to
those of the actors in the movie. This perturbed me. They look like me.
I know I have some Czech in me, somewhere. I have never felt th at I
need to find people that I look like. Skin tone and is Italian, my
height is French, hair is German. I don&amp;#8217;t look Jewish. But I always
figured that I was an amalgam. These Czechs, though, they have my face.
Of course what I really mean is that we share facial bone structure.
This is even more clear and present since I have been recently
beardless. For some reason this bothers me. They have my&amp;nbsp;face!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congrats if you made it&amp;nbsp;here!&lt;/p&gt;

So that should note to you that
this is&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In event that you don&amp;#8217;t know, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_people"&gt;Tamil people&lt;/a&gt; are the ethnic
minority in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamils"&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;. The history of the Tamil&amp;#8217;s shows striking
parallels to that of my own people. I don&amp;#8217;t have the space here to go
into full, comparative detail. So let&amp;#8217;s start with modern history&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people in the United States are keenly aware of the strife that
British Empire introduced to the Middle East with their policy of
Partition for Israel/Palestine in 1948. To a lesser extent, we
understand that our chums across the pond created huge problems for the
world when they partitioned India from Pakistan at the same time. What
is not well known here is that at the same time that India and Pakistan
were split, Sri Lanka was made into a separate&amp;nbsp;sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stemming from the independence came many problems. Mired in history that
I am not covering here, Sri Lanka&amp;#8217;s Sinhalese majority and the Tamil
minority have been effectively at war since 1948. From such a prolonged
conflict has come many unsavoury types and deeds on both sides. I am not
here to argue who was worse when. I am here to sue for&amp;nbsp;pluralism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent push, the Sinhalese-majority government declawed the
Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam, the Tamil&amp;#8217;s former military
establishment. However, it appears that this has been just the first
step in a larger attempt on genocide on the Sri Lankan&amp;nbsp;Tamils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up now on the urging of one of my friends and her mother.
They are Tamil living in diaspora. Specifically, they requested for me
to bring to the attention of my friends and relations a recent
condemnation of the Sri Lankan government made by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel"&gt;Elie Wiesel&lt;/a&gt;, the
famous holocaust survivor and&amp;nbsp;author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left: 40px"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eliewieselfoundation.org/inthenews.aspx"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAMIL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STATEMENT&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever minorities are being persecuted we must raise our voices to
protest.&amp;nbsp; According to reliable sources, the Tamil people are being
disenfranchised and victimized by the Sri Lanka authorities.&amp;nbsp; This
injustice must stop.&amp;nbsp; The Tamil people must be allowed to live in peace
and flourish in their&amp;nbsp;homeland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elie Wiesel, June 30th&amp;nbsp;2009&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please, if there is any news outlet, religious organization, or the like
that you could forward this statement onto, I know it would be
appreciated.&amp;nbsp; Help send the message that this sort of inhuman behaviour
will not be tolerated in the 21st century.&amp;nbsp; You have my personal&amp;nbsp;gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;

Let&amp;#8217;s finish this off&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Believe it or not, the second day was when the pucky really
hit the fan. Shane and I slept soundly the night before so we got sort
of a late start. We saw the Tortoises a couple of more times on our way
up to Hamilton Lake. It was another couple of thousand feet up over a
short and steep trail. Serene and clam, the lake provided our lunch time
spot at about 1&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With plenty of daylight left to us, I posed the question to Shane on
whether to press on to Precipice Lake or to stay at Hamilton for the
night. Shane wisely lead us up and&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the hike to Hamilton was steep, the one to Precipice was worse.
Notice a trend? On the way we come across a couple of guys making their
decent. Apparently, they were trying to go from Giant Forest to Mt.
Whitney in a mere 5 days. This leg of the hike was too much for them and
so they decided to turn back and do some other route with their time.
This was our first sign. Oddly one of the men knew about Eric Schwartz,
whose t-shirt Shane was&amp;nbsp;wearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further up this leg, we meet a couple of other guys, also on their way
down. We tell them that we are going to stay the night at Precipice.
They tell us that there is snow there. We say &amp;#8220;Great, we&amp;#8217;d love to cool
off!&amp;#8221; They inform us that it would be well worth the 45 minutes to push
over Kaweah Gap that night. We thank them and continue on. This was our
second&amp;nbsp;sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We loose the trail several times on our way up to the lake because of
vast snow cover. This was our third sign. But we make it to Precipice
and this is what we&amp;nbsp;see&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SlI09zytf1I/AAAAAAAABow/YGPiw9CwsMs/s400/023_PrecipiceFrozen%5BAnthony%5D.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Shane gets the question&amp;nbsp;again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do we press on or do we turn back and go to Hamilton?&amp;#8221; It is 5:30 pm.
Light is no longer a luxury. We need to make for a place to camp. Not
wanting to backtrack after this ordeal, Shane orders the push over the&amp;nbsp;gap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail has been converted into a stream for most of the rest of the
short and flat jaunt to Kaweah Gap. But hiking down the other side of
the gap into the Big Arroyo Valley was easily the most dangerous and
difficult part of the&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking in the sweeping vista for a few minutes, we decide that we
need to make it to the valley floor and the trail (which we think we can
see in the distance) before dark. Unfortunately, the trail is snowed out
even worse on this side! The parts of the trail that we can&amp;#8217;t find are
now measured in quarters of a mile, and not yards. We don&amp;#8217;t know where
we are going and we can&amp;#8217;t see how to get there. &lt;strong&gt;In a word:&amp;nbsp;Lost.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;Down&amp;#8217; is the best, chilly, dusky guess we can muster. But the hillside
is steep and snowy. And where it is not snow-covered, it is rocky and
rugged. It does not take us long to arrive at an impasse that we can&amp;#8217;t
simply walk down. I think for a moment. I look around again. Then I
remember a part in &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=VQewd9LDbzgC&amp;amp;dq=desert+solitaire&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;source=bn&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ei=1ytqSqqRO8aStgfFxsC6Cw&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;oi=book_result&amp;amp;ct=result&amp;amp;resnum=4"&gt;Desert Solitaire&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; where Edward Abbey, being too
lazy to walk down a snowy mountain he had climbed, decided that it was
much easier to slide down a snow&amp;nbsp;drift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ding! Off go our packs and shoved in front of us, they lead us down 60
feet that we could not have walked down, to the next ledge. Thanks
Eddie-Baby, that trick worked&amp;#8230;once. The next impassable portion was
too steep even for that to be vaguely&amp;nbsp;safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, there is a place in the rock that Shane and I can climb down and
only have to jump around 5 feet to make it. However, there was no way
for us to have our packs on and live. We considered lowering them down
on ropes, but even that seemed risky. But! If we had good aim, we might
be able to throw them to the next ledge down. Tricky business since the
ledge we wanted to hit gave us less than a foot for margin of error with
the width of our&amp;nbsp;packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Shane, &amp;#8220;Is everything secured?&amp;#8221; For each pack, Shane grabbed the
top of the pack and I the bottom. One, two, three, and off they went!
Amazingly they both made their mark! Mine almost went over the far edge,
but thankfully did&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Shit!&amp;#8221;, I yelled as I remembered that my camera was still attached to
the &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; of the backpack and probably took the brunt of the fall.
Apparently, my brother safely secured his inside his attic&amp;#8230; Even
though I felt like an idiot, my camera ended up being fine&amp;nbsp;(Wheeew).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make it to the warmer valley floor and find the trail. We hike for an
hour before making camp by the mosquito-infested river. Fuckin&amp;#8217; day two,
I&amp;nbsp;swear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3:&lt;/strong&gt; We find ourselves today in a high mountain valley, on the
wrong side of the Great Western Divide. We had crossed it the day before
at Kaweah gap. We hike downriver, crossing several rivers and streams,
until we turn off and up to the Little Five Lakes. We make good time and
stop for lunch at about&amp;nbsp;noon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part of the trip takes us over Blackrock Pass, the
next-southernmost crossing of the Great Western Divide. At this point
one might consider us bored by words like &amp;#8216;snow&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;rock&amp;#8217;. Or barring
that experts at traversing them.&amp;nbsp;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackrock Pass offered new and exciting ways to loose the trail. On the
way up, the trail was out as often as it was in. I&amp;#8217;d often scramble up
over rocks to get an elevated perspective on where the trail re-emerged.
I&amp;#8217;d shout out the information back down to Shane, who was not so dumb as
to hop over anything with a full pack on. Finally, we see Blackrock
itself. And between it and us is the largest snow field I have ever seen
in June. What must have been at least 400 yards across, it hid the trail
and thus any idea of where we were actually&amp;nbsp;going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brief patches of trail-like land appeared for 10 feet or so before
disappearing back into snowy anonymity. However, most of the snow is
below a certain elevation, like salt collecting in the bottom of a bowl.
Unfortunately, once we make it beyond the vast snow, we have the side of
the bowl to deal&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I have used the word steep previously. That was a misuse. Making
it to the top of Blackrock Pass was steep. Angles of 75+ degrees,
hands-and-knees on jagged rocks steep. Somewhere between this, ~65 lbs
on his back, and an elevation of close to 12,000 feet, Shane started
complaining that he wasn&amp;#8217;t feeling&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crap. We *have* to get over this thing! Tonight! I give him the pep
talk about no trail being hard if you are willing to spend the proper
amount of time on it. We take frequent breaks. At long last we make it.
It is very very windy at the&amp;nbsp;top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SlI1bcmgbNI/AAAAAAAABs4/HZx4GO7Vdfc/s400/050_ShaneAway%5BAnthony%5D.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth every&amp;nbsp;gust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night we hike down to the Kaweah Middle Fork Valley giddy at our
accomplishment. Oh, and the ability to walk downhill. We make camp at
Pinto Lake and Shane sets up the&amp;nbsp;hammock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Mosquitoes drove us fast and early that morning and we make
excellent time: 7 miles before lunch at Redwood Meadow. There we meet a
creepy guy who wanted to show us a &amp;#8216;special mushroom&amp;#8217; that he thinks he
can find again&amp;#8230; We declined in feigned interest of feeding&amp;nbsp;ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to make it to the foothills, camp, wake up the next morning
and go to Buckeye Flats and hitch a ride back to our car. Nature had
other&amp;nbsp;plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the middle of a creek, it starts to rain, lightning, and
thunder. This is the backpacking equivalent of being caught with your
pants down and your junk in a melon or any vegetable halfway up your
cootter-hole. We get the fuck out of that&amp;nbsp;creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We throw our rain gear on and take a sweaty run farther down the
mountain to where it is no longer raining. Between the great time we
made that morning and being recently propelled by weather, we make for
Buckeye Flats that&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, near dark, we do end up getting there and finding a camp-site.
We had walked 23+ miles that day. In the last 28 hours we had gone from
an elevation of 12,000 feet to a mere 3,000 or so. Our bodies were
spent. Food and sleep were the only conceivable&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how Asian tourists doing Karaoke by the fire at the camp next
door wasn&amp;#8217;t on that list? They&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#8217;t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, recall the calm and professional way we handled that bear from Day
One? Yeah, no one at the camp site was there for that, so they all
freaked the hell&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really is amazing what will keep you awake when you are that&amp;nbsp;tired!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5:&lt;/strong&gt; The next morning which hitched a ride back to our car, as
planned. We went to Three Rivers, took a shower and then drove back to
Santa&amp;nbsp;Ynez.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Shane said to me at one point, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think I like pain as you.&amp;#8221;
This trip was&amp;nbsp;incredible!&lt;/p&gt;

my brother Shane in Sequoia. But if it is any indication of how hectic
my life has been recently, I am just sitting down to write the post
about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long and the short of the trip was that since we took our parents
van we couldn&amp;#8217;t make it to Mineral King, a very steep and remote part of
the park. However, there were still some trails that lead off from Giant
Forest that we had yet to do. Specifically, The High Sierra&amp;nbsp;Trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Sierra Trail has a pretty interesting history itself. It is
essentially a quite long, well established cut-off trails. It was meant
as a quick way to give access to longer and more imposing back country
romps like the Pacific Crest Trail and the John Muir Trail. Starting
from Crescent Meadow in Giant Forest, the High Sierra Trail takes you 60
miles up and down to the peak of Mt. Whitney (the highest peak in the
continental&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not what we did. Hiking clear east across the park and up Mt.
Whitney was not the plan this time out. However, we did end up walking a
couple of days down this way and used the High Sierra Trail to cross the
Great Western Divide the first time. But the really strange thing about
the High Sierra Trail was that it was both very busy. And in spite of
this traffic, everyone on it was a little off, if not downright&amp;nbsp;nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1:&lt;/strong&gt; We pretty much walk into this bear on our first mile out. I
have been close to bears before but never like that. Shane is the one
who has to tell me that there was a bear ten feet in front of me on the
trail, if only I would bother to look up. We stand there and look at
each other, us and the bear, for a moment. Shane and I make ourselves
big, wait, and then take a step towards it. The bear scuttles off. It
was pretty&amp;nbsp;comical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SkvxpDEpvTI/AAAAAAAABZs/TgeIKyEtk5s/s400/p6260001.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did not take us long for us to meet a certain older couple for the
first time. She was lithe and ladylike. He had a classic seventies
&amp;#8216;stash. We nick named them the &amp;#8216;Tortoises&amp;#8217; to our &amp;#8216;Hares&amp;#8217;. We would pass
them, take an extended break. They would chug along and pass us. We
would sleep in, only to find them ahead of us on the trail again! This
scenario played out five times in various ways over the course of two&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day while eating lunch in the middle of the trail, a mule
train came upon us. While we are moving out of the way, the leader (who
was decked out in full, real cowboy attire) made small talk with us. He
asked what we were eating. We responded, &amp;#8220;Ummmmm peanut butter and jelly
on a tortilla.&amp;#8221; The esteemed gentleman&amp;#8217;s uninterrupted response was
&amp;#8220;Nothin&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;Better!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we made it to Bearpaw Meadow, the family in the camp next to us
strongly hinted that we were not welcome there. Not wanting to be part
of any club that had such jerks as members, we took the easy road and&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I am tired in real life&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;ll try getting the rest out&amp;nbsp;soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know it has been a while. But &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/BackpackingCombined2009#"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are the pictures from my
backpacking extravaganza. The photos have captions and follow a&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I hope to post about some of the things that cannot be
expressed by pictures about this trip before I leave Raleigh on&amp;nbsp;Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I am now in North Carolina. I think the month I just spent in
California killed any hope for my budding southern accent&amp;#8230; Ahh&amp;nbsp;well&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

due to thermal lag, meteorologically, we are six weeks behind. Which
really would make the solstice the midpoint of the colloquial calendar.
But if you want to go by the best clock there is, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasons#Astronomical"&gt;seasons are
delimited by the solstices and equinoxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Earth being at a certain point in its orbit around the Sun seems
as good a reason to celebrate as any. So no worries! Apparently, there
are six seasons in India&amp;#8230;Damn you Wikipedia for being so damned&amp;nbsp;informative&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;Though, through the usefulness of English, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsummer"&gt;Midsummer&lt;/a&gt; also refers
to this same general time. Especially, if in regards to a religious
context. So maybe the title here is a bit&amp;nbsp;presumptuous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, the real reason I am posting this is that I have &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Solstice#"&gt;some
pictures from the Solstice Parade (Full Gallery)&lt;/a&gt; in Santa&amp;nbsp;Barbara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, some people gave me ideas for next years Flipside. Like this
crowd wearing giant Tetris&amp;nbsp;pieces&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sj7Ep7teiyI/AAAAAAAAA_o/vu3STsXf7LQ/s400/p6200014.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the girl doing a suspension act inside of a giant balloon&amp;nbsp;float&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Sj7IVgBb_XI/AAAAAAAABDI/iPgm_ImcN7k/s400/p6200062.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, we&amp;#8217;d be remiss here without the locals on jumping&amp;nbsp;stilts&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the end of the day, it all comes down to how chill you are with
your&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt;

have limited appeal, but here it is&amp;nbsp;nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a totally unrelated note,&lt;/strong&gt; I finally got my pair of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/products_KSO_f.cfm"&gt;Vibram Five
Fingers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSO&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/a&gt; Naturally, my feet are too small and I am forced to buy
the&amp;nbsp;women&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a totally unrelated note,&lt;/strong&gt; I went to the Book Den and found and
purchased &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;`Intermediate Types among Primitive Folk`_&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;, &lt;em&gt;circa&lt;/em&gt;
1914. &amp;#8216;Primitive Folk&amp;#8217; has a fairly obvious meaning. &amp;#8216;Intermediate
Types&amp;#8217;, however, is early 20th century parlance for transvestites,
transsexuals, hermaphrodites, and anyone else who doesn&amp;#8217;t fit into the
gender binary. Now mind you, criticisms abound. But this book is
h.a.w.t.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOT&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a totally unrelated note,&lt;/strong&gt; I went to the Book Den and found and
purchased a 1907 partially-illustrated copy of the Nibelungenlied. Or
for those unfamiliar with German epic, the mythological retelling upon
which Wagner based his famous Ring&amp;nbsp;cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a totally unrelated note,&lt;/strong&gt; my father got back from a business trip
to Japan today and brought me a Gundam action figure! Thanks&amp;nbsp;Pops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a totally unrelated note,&lt;/strong&gt; for broader appeal, Weird Al has
released his best music video in years: a Doors-esque cometary on&amp;nbsp;Craigslist.&lt;/p&gt;

It has been a week! I really am not getting to write as often as I
need to. Such brief solace, my tabula rasa&amp;nbsp;overfloweth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to ramble on about what I have done in the past week. The
following few statements will have to suffice. I went to Irvine and saw
many people I love deeply, but sadly missed others. My father left for a
business trip to Japan, placing me in an all-awkward, semi-parental
role. My maternal units have had a rough shake this time. Naturally, I
feel behind with all of this going&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Si781-4cmYI/AAAAAAAAA9s/ovdZim77hBs/s400/CA1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is a picture from the car on a recent trip to Santa Maria with
my mom. It has really only been that nice weather-wise three or four
days since I have been here. Sad that the sunny and wonderful is now the
climatological exception. I am certain that this is getting me&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;, with Meenon, I went to see this hip show called &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Gaps in the
Fossil Record&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;. It was about a 65 yro Palaeontology professor who
falls in love with, marries, and impregnates his 21 yro student. The
show begins when the newly weds move in with her mom, who is naturally
closer to the good doctor&amp;#8217;s age than her daughter. Complete with a
post-apocalyptic twist at the end, the show was&amp;nbsp;amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one of those only-in-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; kind of experiences. The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504762/"&gt;playwright&lt;/a&gt;
for this work in progress has acted in such films as &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;The Mask of
Zorro&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Gods and Generals&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;. The mother figure was played
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0153108/"&gt;Nancy Charles&lt;/a&gt;, who has been in everything. It was top-notch and I am
always happy when Meenon takes me to these neat&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, my brother Shane was in a No on Prop. 8 dance theatre
production this last quarter called &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Everyone Deserves A Happy
Ending&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; He plays the movie star guy, one of the two male leads. It is
about 15 minutes long. It is in two-parts on YouTube&amp;nbsp;(below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please watch it if you can. As you can see, they mix a lot of dance
types in one piece. I find the jurisprudence tap-battle genius. If I
dare say it, the other male lead (Eli) played his role with a hit of
Buster Keaton. And on a personal note, it is deeply satisfying to be
able to truly tease my little brother about the fist time he kissed a
boy there being lights, music playing, an audience clapping for him,
confetti in the air, &lt;em&gt;et cetra&lt;/em&gt;. I am very proud of&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of my time in Irvine was spent with my cousin Andrew. One
of the things he introduced me to this time out was the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HBO&lt;/span&gt; show,
&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Rome&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;. Rome is ridiculously good. However, the spice that kicks it
out of the water is certainly &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1203457/"&gt;Lyndsey Marshal&lt;/a&gt; as&amp;nbsp;Cleopatra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know how to express how I feel about her / this role / that
time. Perfection falls somehow short. So I&amp;#8217;ll let dear ol&amp;#8217; coz do it for
me. &lt;strong&gt;He called me a &amp;#8220;Fucking Fetishist&amp;#8221;.&lt;/strong&gt; And if that isn&amp;#8217;t the most
exalted redundant phase in English, I&amp;#8217;d like to hear the other&amp;nbsp;contenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then yesterday, I was listening to an episode of the Savage Lovecast
(ep 138) where he was talking about the true versus ironic usage of the
word &amp;#8216;fetish&amp;#8217;. Thus spake&amp;nbsp;Merriam-Webster:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*An object or bodily part whose real or fantasised presence is
psychologically necessary for sexual gratification and that is an object
of fixation to the extent that it may interfere with complete sexual
expression.*&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damn it! I guess they are right&amp;#8230; I always sort of prided myself on
having a tertiary openness to other types. But the jig is up! Maybe I
should drop the mask and try to confront my desires more head on.&amp;nbsp;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know what my fetish object is, Lyndsey Marshal as the
opium-addicted Cleopatra in the 7th episode of &amp;#8216;Rome&amp;#8217; is a genuine
specimen. This is not to say that Lyndsey Marshal herself is a necessary
component for my sexual gratification. I am a fucking fetishist, not a
fucking&amp;nbsp;creep.&lt;/p&gt;

In truth this post
should have happened many days ago. Normally, I post a lot more when I
am travelling because of the random periods of downtime which give me an
opportunity to blather on. But in my backlog of email, folks have been
asking me how my trip is going. Here is my&amp;nbsp;response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California is a mess. You hear about how the State is in a bad way from
the media, but any sceptic looking in would be hard pressed to believe
that the situation is as doom and gloom as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt; claims. The tension here
is palpable. Everyone is jittery, on edge. It was difficult for me to
believe that this was the case even in lackadaisical places like Santa
Barbara until I visited. Never mind Los Angeles or Irvine. And all
reports say that the Bay Area is worse&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can blame it on the Economy (with the big &amp;#8216;E&amp;#8217;). But this has
transmigrated to something else, I tell ya! This is a communal,
regional, global mental hypertension. Paranoia. A psychological
disability that spans the Pacific&amp;nbsp;coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, going west from Texas is always a relief. Running away from
school, even with the electronic leash that I write this on, is
perpetually gratifying. Not this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, leaving Austin is &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; hard. Yet going back to
the closest thing I have to a home has in the past made it somehow
alright. But now I feel somewhat disconnected from the Southern
California experience. The party is over, the lights came back on, and I
just&amp;nbsp;arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, it has been wonderful to see my friends and marvellous to
spend time with my&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to my favourite crepe place in Santa Barbara after I landed with
my parents, Grandmother, and psuedo-grandfather. My psuedo-cousin from
Morgan Hill, Garrick, came down later and visited me last Friday and
then I saw the majority of his family at a Wedding Reception the next
day. It made the whole transition very&amp;nbsp;pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, I popped down to Beverly Hills to visit Shawn and his girlfriend
Mal. We went to a couple of parks and walked a lot. They are both
prepping for Graduate/Law school and seemed fairly stressed. Overall the
transition will be good for them and I think they are excited. Shawn and
I got some good face time later that&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday through Thursday I was hanging out with my Mom in Santa Ynez,
with side trips to Santa Barbara and Santa Ynez. I still don&amp;#8217;t leave the
house much when I am in Santa Ynez; some things never&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Friday, how stressed out everyone around me was finally got to me. I
broke. In front of my Mom, which she didn&amp;#8217;t really deserve. I
apologized. I ran down to Santa Barbara quickly and had dinner with my
cousin Aaron. From there I went to my&amp;nbsp;Grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Grandmother is currently on a vacation to New York so I drove her to
her sister&amp;#8217;s place in Manhattan Beach, where she was leaving from the
next day. At 10:30 pm Friday night, I finally made it to Irvine. Rew,
Twin, Jessica and I went out to dinner. I love these&amp;nbsp;people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday my cousin, Jessica and I met up with Jessica&amp;#8217;s friends in
Pasadena for a hike. The hike was pleasant. We went to a waterfall and I
hiked up to the top. However, a variety of other experiences (including
uncooked food at a restaurant) marred the overall trip for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I went to Sunday Brunch with my brother Shane and two of his
friends at a Texas-themed outfit in Newport Beach. He seemed stressed
for a variety of reasons. It is his finals week, so this is&amp;nbsp;understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one incident this week the genuinely pissed me off though.
Last Saturday, Sean fell 125 ft off of a waterfall cliff. Luckily, he is
ok and miraculously managed to not break anything and last I heard was
recovering fine. However, I didn&amp;#8217;t hear about this until Wednesday
night, when I emailed him about&amp;nbsp;backpacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What?! In fact no one in my family heard. Sean is my brother; I would
have been up there in a heart beat. I was three and a half hours away. I
feel like I should be on the short list of people who get called first.
Someone, somewhere should have gotten the word to me. I even talked to
our mutual friends in the interim and they didn&amp;#8217;t even mention it in&amp;nbsp;passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, this trip has been fairly manic. The state and everyone
in it, myself included, seem to be having drastic mood swings. I am
really happy to see everyone, but less enthused that they are so
perturbed otherwise. California might be becoming cheap enough to live
in at the cost of not being&amp;nbsp;liveable.&lt;/p&gt;

I
know I promised not to write anymore about Flipside, but there are a
couple of quick things that need addressing and then I may make a post
about Religion later. Stay&amp;nbsp;tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retox:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who made it to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pingg.com/rsvp/p55d3vfakdizi83zw"&gt;my Flipside Retox Party!&lt;/a&gt; It was a
very relaxed and pleasant experience. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/6446649.html"&gt;It was probably a good thing that
we didn&amp;#8217;t go downtown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you couldn&amp;#8217;t make it out, then next year. And maybe I won&amp;#8217;t host it
on a Thursday nor run out of&amp;nbsp;Vodka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pictures:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Flipside09#"&gt;my lame Flipside pictures&lt;/a&gt;, I want to give a big shout
out to ! He has posted some of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/molachai/sets/72157618938643650/"&gt;his Flipside&amp;nbsp;pictures.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since this is my personal blog, here are some of my favorite
pictures that he took of me. We&amp;#8217;ll start with one of the Acrobatic Yoga
/ Pirate Outfit&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we&amp;#8217;ll move on to the Valkyrie playing with spin sticks. (Now on&amp;nbsp;Facebook!)&lt;/p&gt;

I mean this in two&amp;nbsp;regards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this while on the plane from Austin to Phoenix (and
then to Santa Barbara). This post is duly locked to just the California crowds, which
increasingly seem synonymous with the set of people who get to read my
private&amp;nbsp;expose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of my negative Flipside experiences were in regards to
the women-folk who I am or was interested in. I went to Flipside with
the expectation that I would meet a bunch of new, cool people and that I
would do something more than flirt with a couple of them. For instance,
some of the days I was so sore that I would have sold my first-born for
a massage, which I never got. Naturally, I didn&amp;#8217;t make out with anyone
either, which likely condemns me to 3 more months of&amp;nbsp;celibacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I am a bit disappointed. Part of this is probably that
Flipside is this sort of event. Most people come and go as a group. And
then, doing a hard sell on how awesome you are is not really tolerated.
If you have something amazing to show, bring it to the&amp;nbsp;table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is definitely skewed against boys, as Jason and I found
out. This is doubly odd as there is a healthy excess margin of women
over men at this burn event. One would think that having less available
men than women (and and even proportion of homosexuals) would make boys
a slightly more desired commodity. But no. The polar opposite. The
female advantage that exists in the real world was accentuated here.
(Which was part of why putting on the dress was a smart&amp;nbsp;idea.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all is not lost, right?! I came with not one, but two groups! Surely
someone out of the 50 odd people I knew going in must have a level of
mutual attraction with me. And having this level, it could be raised a
bit by the burn&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- About half of my 6 or so bad experiences at Flipside were a result of
awkwardness and negative vibes around Leigh from **Sparkadelica**. Leigh
is the cool performance artist whose lollipop I drunkenly stole a couple
of weeks ago. She seemed to flip-flop between talking to me nicely and
being so curt that I thought she was dropping me like a bad habit, cold
turkey.

So I don't know if I insulted her at some point, or came on too strongly
before, or what. I feel really bad if I did. But neither do I know what
to do about it. She simply does not seem interested in communicating
with me. Which is weird because I get along marvelously with her older
sister and younger brother. I am using her as solid evidence for why I
shouldn't date straight and narrow girls.

Pretty much everyone else in Sparkadelica was attached. However, I am
likely a member of **Misfits** in the first place because I met Ratha,
builder of Yurts. We were at the big construction project assembly a
week and a half before and I decided to talk to her because I thought
she was hot.

It is hard to pin down what she is thinking because she is the only
other person I have flagged as flipping between Introvert and Extrovert
as easily and often as I do. Unlike me though, she is default Introvert
(I am default Extrovert) and neither does she seem to control it in the
same way I do [not confirmed].

I have a hard time judging whether she is interested in me or thinks of
me as some cute, dumb kid. Ratha is a 8 years my senior, a point-of-fact
I did not learn until the second day of Flipside. I'd swear she's 26 on
looks alone. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We flirt. And not in the playful way that I flirt with people who I
never want to be in bed with (like 95% of my male friends). Rather more
in that subtle way that you flirt with people who you are actually
interested in, but want to test the waters with soundly first. Ratha:
&amp;#8220;That girl was right when she said you had a sweet face.&amp;#8221; Or she&amp;#8217;ll
smile coyly when I refer to the problems with my sex life being similar
to that of a male Praying&amp;nbsp;Mantis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- But then when push comes to shove, no soap. She and her brother Tom left
a day early. This was partially because Ratha did not feel well on the
first day. However, it was more, from my understanding, because Tom had
his fill and wanted to go home.

In any event, I told Ratha that if she wanted to stay for the last night
that she could crash in my tent and that Tom could drive their truck
back. She didn't take me up on this offer. There are a lot of variables
here, so maybe I shouldn't take this as a sign that she isn't
necessarily interested. But if she had come, that would have been a
clearer indication that she *was* interested. And maybe I would have
actually gotten a much needed massage out of the deal. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other people from other camps as well, but none panned out
either. Specifically, there were a couple of girls from &lt;strong&gt;Ish&lt;/strong&gt; who I
danced with on different nights, separately, at different places. The
come-and-go-with-your-camp phenomenon was what killed anything from
happening in spite of the beginnings of a&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- ***(Alright, time to take another breath and change tracks.)***

So you, California, obviously remember Beanie. The girl I wrote you
about who I made out with in my tent the week before Flipside, at Pallas
Beltane. Here is an update.

Beanie ended up coming to my Flipside Retox party last night, even
though she was not actually at Flipside. Moreover, she brought me to the
airport today. But about an hour before she was supposed to pick me up,
I ran over to Toy Joy to get some luggage tags. Of course I ended up
spending $20 on the *Hello Kitty* ones, but whatever. Beanie was killing
time in Toy Joy so I poked her and we decided to leave a bit early and
pick up some lunch.

I am really glad that she still wants to be my friend. And as it happens
her relationship with her boyfriend, Eric, has survived. Which is good.
However, it was not undamaged by our experience. Which is bad. It sounds
like they have worked through a lot of it and me being away for the
summer can only be good on that front.

But I did tell her what we had worked out in the last post on this
topic. (Basically, that I was temporarily worse for the wear from the
experience but that it probably was a net positive on my part, on the
assumption that I didn't destroy her relationship.) I tried to reassure
her that I take her lead in this matter. But neither does she bear all
of the responsibility in this situation. I crossed a line that I
shouldn't have crossed. I was being selfish. AND HOLY CRAP IS THE PLANE
BUMPY RIGHT NOW!!!

I feel like my part in this has reached some sort of resolution. But I
am deeply sorry that I have caused her and Eric strife. Which still
might make me a terrible person... --&gt;

quickly. I am trying to make it very clear what is happening in my head.
I welcome your input and&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CONFLICT&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I am in love with two camps and I don&amp;#8217;t quite know
what to do for next&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, &lt;strong&gt;Sparkadelica&lt;/strong&gt; is an amazing group of people and I am
honored to be even peripherally part of their organization this time
out. Next year, I have been invited to join full&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a founding member of the &lt;strong&gt;Misfits&lt;/strong&gt;, I am stunned at how well known
we were and what we managed to pull together inside a week. Next year
could surely be even&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm what to do? I have a year to figure this&amp;nbsp;out&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARGUMENTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPARKADELICA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGAINST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MISFITS&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Basically, the
Sparks are an awesome set with a lot of love and some superb group art
projects that I would have an absolute blast participating in. The
mutant vehicle, balloon temple and sign are all great works that I would
enjoy adding my piece&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, joining would allow me to sleep up on the Playa and eat
the Spakadelica food and generally be more coordinated with this
fantastic set of&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Misfits, as the name implies, could (though it is unlikely) be
significantly less coordinated. Especially when it comes to communal
meals (which I am frankly not big&amp;nbsp;on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARGUMENTS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MISFITS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGAINST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPARKADELICA&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yurts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from Yurts, I *really* jive with the idea of giving a home to
the homeless. I did not join Sparkadelica because I did not meet the
requirements in time. I fully understand and agree with why Ant made the
decisions about Spark exclusivity that he did. I respect him for
sticking to these rules and being very upfront about them. However, the
Misfits are / should be on the opposite of the spectrum with regards to
this. If someone doesn&amp;#8217;t have a camp, or for whatever reason can&amp;#8217;t join
the camp they want, they should have a place to go. As long as they
aren&amp;#8217;t an asshole. &lt;em&gt;Radical Inclusion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Misfits were there for me in my time of need, I strongly feel like I
should help pass this new tradition&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Misfits were also a wonderful, spectacular group of people. We were
also more evenly spread out. The only age group not represented by us
this time were children. And that was probably for the&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I would not have to sleep up on the Playa if I wasn&amp;#8217;t with
Sparkedleica. I am sorry, but those generators bothered me a lot. There
was a guy, Stray from &lt;strong&gt;Ish&lt;/strong&gt;, who camped out alone near us, far from
his camp. When he went to try to sleep, he wanted to actually&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I overheard someone in Sparkadelica say that they might be getting
to large and may try to limit growth. But that could just be hearsay.
And Sparkadelica would benefit since their overflow could come down and
join us, no questions&amp;nbsp;asked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CURRENT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RESOLUTION&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously, there is still a lot of time to
try to figure it this out and many things may change. Who&amp;nbsp;knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I think I am going to try to do at this point is join both
camps. I&amp;#8217;ll pay dues, attend meetings, help with set-up and tear down
for&amp;nbsp;everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I would probably put my tent down with Misfits
(so I could sleep). And this sneaky plan is dependent on both camp leads
being copacetic with the idea. However, I feel like it would be a cruel
joke to make me choose between two fucking sweet groups of people. The
whole idea is that you should do what ever has a positive impact.
Participating formally with both sets would net me the&amp;nbsp;most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the problem with having a truly awesome first Flipside&amp;nbsp;experience&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, Please, Please, no one take this the wrong way.&amp;nbsp;Ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

Many
of these are similar to the general backpackers&amp;#8217; credo. However, the
most interesting of these are the radical ones: Radical Inclusion,
Radical Self-Reliance, and Radical&amp;nbsp;Self-Expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical&amp;nbsp;Inclusion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most self-evident of the three, the idea that anyone can participate
does not stop at the door. While joining a camp can have varying degrees
of exclusivity, everywhere is home. The inclusion principle more than
anything else makes the entire event very low pressure. Become
inebriated, or don&amp;#8217;t. No worries. If you don&amp;#8217;t like what you are
experiencing then go somewhere else. There are pretty, shiny things&amp;nbsp;everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, as much as anything, probably serves to explain the staggering
number of Jews I met. At first glance, this would seem odd for an event
that effectively rebuilds a Golden Calf (and burns&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical&amp;nbsp;Self-Reliance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pallas, I understood that I should probably come prepared more for
something between backpacking and car camping. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WRONG&lt;/span&gt;! Flipside is about
living more luxuriously than car camping, possibly better than you do in
your day-to-day life. Still, this backpacker mentality really sticks
with&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radical&amp;nbsp;Self-Expression:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very guarded normally, but I don&amp;#8217;t think I have ever felt as
expressive as at Flipside. Sean of the Dead and I were having a
conversation about how your internal monologue can just come right on
out. Just by saying what you think almost all the time, what you think
becomes so much more&amp;nbsp;positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me this leads to some awesome opportunities. I can drop in and out
of conversations with people I have never met. When I start my crazy
rambling, strangers come in and tell me something even&amp;nbsp;stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One morning while I was cleaning my breakfast plate, some girl walked by
wearing purple bikini bottoms, a fuchsia top, and was using a white sash
as a canopy to cover her eyes from the sun. I smiled at her. She said,
haltingly, &amp;#8220;I have walked by before and seen you. You have a sweet
face.&amp;#8221; I gave her a hug and she walked&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something wonderfully right with the world that this was
allowed to happen. There is something terribly wrong in that it does not
happen more often and seems relegated to&amp;nbsp;Flipside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAKE&lt;/span&gt; A&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BREATH&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than dressing as a Valkyrie and a Pirate, I did other costuming as
well. For the burn on Sunday, I picked up a reasonably tight fitting red
dress from &lt;strong&gt;Glam Camp&lt;/strong&gt;. To this I added a string of red fairy lights
wrapped around my body. Additionally, I bummed a black mesh kerchief
from Jayme which we turned into a choker.&amp;nbsp;Hawt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQUEE&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The undercutting theme of the event is to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.asofterworld.com/index.php?id=436"&gt;try to push and explore your
own boundaries while respecting those of everyone around you&lt;/a&gt;. Cross
dressing to this level is not something I have done in a long time. Yet,
I can&amp;#8217;t help feeling I sort of cheated since cross dressing is not
*truly* pushing any of my boundaries. Still, I got more exposure in
feminine garb in this dress than ever&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wonderful thing about it, was that the outfit itself did most the
work of turning me into a sex-object. (The dress is clearly a sex object
on its own, by design.) I got &lt;em&gt;a ton&lt;/em&gt; of comments from both genders.
They were spread pretty evenly along the forwardness spectrum. Here is a
sample, in order of increasing&amp;nbsp;intensity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Nice Dress.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Are you a princess?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; (My answer was to strike a pose.)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;I love that color on you.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Hey Sexy!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;etc,&lt;/em&gt; you see where this is going&amp;#8230;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck, can I wear this get up every day?! I often rail against the fact
that men don&amp;#8217;t get truly sexy clothing in our culture. Maybe the
solution really just is for men to co-opt women&amp;#8217;s clothing. It was so
fucking nice to be objectified in this fashion. Certainly it would get
old as a 24/7/365 thing (Helloooo, Feminism). But even if this was just
for play-play it was super. Unfortunately, pictures are still&amp;nbsp;forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the sexual aspects of dress play were neatly counter-balanced by
Noah, the 12 yro kid in the neighbouring camp. A rather effeminate boy
himself, he took to school yard teasing in a fit of cosmic irony. While
playing catch with a hacky-sack with him, Noah took to calling me
Man-Woman. This somehow developed into a super-hero/villain tag line.
&amp;#8220;By day, Man-Woman. By Night, Still Man-Woman.&amp;#8221; It was cute; I&amp;nbsp;laughed.&lt;/p&gt;

wonderful, positively positive Burning Flipside experience. No holes
barred! (Though that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean they got&amp;nbsp;filled&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I wrote notes every night before going to bed about what had
happened that day. The following is a very brief summary. Think of this
as a bullet point list that sets the stage for future&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Shs6_BwjDjI/AAAAAAAAA4g/5Uo4BOm8SyM/s400/MisfitsCamp04.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drove out to near Pedernales with my top down and the car full of
camping gear. Once at Flipside, I was greeted with the token lovely
&amp;#8220;Welcome Home.&amp;#8221; While I was surveying the area, Ratha and Tom drove up.
We zoned our camp site. While setting up my tent, I helped them set up
Ratha&amp;#8217;s fan-fucking-tasty Yurt [shown above]. After the shade structure
was up, &lt;strong&gt;Misfits Camp&lt;/strong&gt; was&amp;nbsp;born!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch I put on a pirate costume and raided &lt;strong&gt;Sparkedelica&lt;/strong&gt;, where
most of the other people I knew coming in were camped. Once there, I
took off the ridiculously hot leather jerkin and was wandering around in
my flow-ey pants. A 72 yro man named Douglas (Burn name: Eternity)
wandered into the Sparkadelica lounge in the heat of the day. He and I
ended up doing &lt;em&gt;Acrobatic Yoga&lt;/em&gt; [shown&amp;nbsp;below].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Shs602wjaqI/AAAAAAAAA2w/GTwzDzejOiU/s400/AcroYoga2.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went and had dinner with the Misfits. From the heat and not having eaten
a lot that day, I managed to get drunk on two glasses of Cabernet
Sauvignon at 8:30 in the evening. Yikes! I walked Ratha partially to her
volunteer greeter shift. Saw Leigh and Sunshine on the way and they led
me to Sparkadelica. Once there, I announced, &amp;#8220;Hello Sparkadelica, I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;Drunk!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the next couple of hours dancing off my buzz in the laser show
in the Sparkadelica lounge. Completely sober, Georgia-based Lauren and
Rowan and I went down to look at the creek at night. I heckled people
the whole way.&amp;nbsp;Hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wandered around after that and noticed how much awesome sound there was
everywhere. Went to&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom and Rathta and I spend the better part of the morning hanging out at
the &lt;strong&gt;Temple of the Steaming Pot&lt;/strong&gt;. Yeah for free coffee! Also, &lt;strong&gt;Obik&lt;/strong&gt;
had some amazing home-made&amp;nbsp;sarsaparilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakia and Jason (Nakia&amp;#8217;s friend from Madison) show up. Jason is as cool
as Nakia talked him up to&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bounce around a lot today. I spend the majority of the afternoon
dressed as a Valkyrie learning to spin poi,&amp;nbsp;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my night to cook so I made my car camping favourite:
Build-Your-Own-Burritos. I forgot one thing the entire trip, and thus
our burritos had no Cholula.&amp;nbsp;Damn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eat more at dinner this night and don&amp;#8217;t get drunk. I bounce around a
lot at night too. At one point I meet up with the Sparks at the camp
&lt;strong&gt;Ish&lt;/strong&gt;. I give Jayme a piggy back ride&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nakia and Jason and I spend hours talking outside of the Misfits camp. I
go to sleep at like 3&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is Martin&amp;#8217;s (a Misfit)&amp;nbsp;birthday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume the Position: I am a good sport and get my tushy paddled at
&lt;strong&gt;Slap That Ass Camp&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason, Tom, and I get coffee in the morning again. I hang around Misfits
until after lunch and they are about to start their pick-up D&amp;amp;D 4th Ed.&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hang up my hammock and let Jayme chill on it and we have a really
great&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wander around and go down to the creek. There I see a bunch of Sparks
in what amounts to a hippie soup and decide not to swim. I catch Ian
from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KFLIP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the Flipside Radio station. We decide to leave the creek
area right before the flash&amp;nbsp;flood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I help &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KFLIP&lt;/span&gt; hold down some of their shade structures during the storm.
Then I rush over to Sparkedelica to help them secure the lounge against
the rain. After the lounge is mostly safe, I head out into the storm in
nothing but my breezy&amp;nbsp;pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wet and cold, I make my way back to the driest place in Flipside:
Ratha&amp;#8217;s Yurt! There a bunch of us take humid shelter and play a game of
Munchkin which Ratha wins [shown below]. We then play the most tense
game of &amp;#8220;Last Night on Earth&amp;#8221; with Gallows and Penitent&amp;nbsp;John.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image2" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/Shs7Bho_TzI/AAAAAAAAA48/nu-QWYeUNbQ/s400/YurtRain1.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night is very clear and I am very sober. I spend the evening with
Ratha, Tom, and Jason and we see a rad Tesla coil music performance.
This was also my first climb up the&amp;nbsp;effigy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I help Ratha and Tom pack up and leave. I hang out with Jason and Nakia
most of the day and&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day, we go over to &lt;strong&gt;Glam Camp&lt;/strong&gt; and pick out clothes for&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rains briefly. I weather it in the hunkered down Sparkedelica lounge.
Afterwards, I help them reassemble for the night&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have dinner with the Misfits + Nakia. Conversation flows naturally. I
go to the bathroom and return to find that all of my camp mates deserted
in the 10 minutes I was gone. I eventually find some of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume the Position: I am a good sport and get my tushy paddled at
&lt;strong&gt;Slap That Ass Camp&lt;/strong&gt;. I get a piece of watermelon for my&amp;nbsp;efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to a burn-ban, the effigy &lt;em&gt;was not&lt;/em&gt; burned. However, something
cooler happened. They did a spin show in front of it, lit off 500 pounds
of fireworks within 20 feet of me, and then I got to help pull the
effigy down! Coolest thing&amp;nbsp;ever!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wander around with Nakia and Jason but loose them at Ish when I start
talking with someone and then fall asleep on their sweet,
sound-activated, bench chair things. I find them again later at the
Temple of the Steaming&amp;nbsp;Pot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wander up to Sparkedelica and then I go back to Misfits and fall&amp;nbsp;asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wake up, Pack up, and get outta&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudely shocked back to reality when a rude man in a Porsche yells at me
for walking too slowly in the cross walk on my way to Wheatsville. I
give him a tiny piece of my mind. Austin is a really great city to live
in, but it is still a&amp;nbsp;city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just got back from my very first &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.burningflipside.com/"&gt;Burning Flipside&lt;/a&gt;. Good golly, Ms
Molly! There was so much pretty, shiny, awesome, tasty, lovely, that
once again I can&amp;#8217;t cover it all in a single post. Or even in a couple of
posts. Or even bother to write them all in a single day. Some of this
stuff needs to sit and gel for a couple of&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am going to do what I did for Pallas. There will be a series of
forthcoming Flipside posts each based around a central theme. I will
definitely start with a &amp;#8216;summary of events&amp;#8217; post, to set the stage.
Certain posts may be locked based on the sensitivity of the material, so
no worries. I shall give myself until Thursday to pop all of these out.
After that, travel happens and I will be&amp;nbsp;distracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re-culturing myself to Civilization is significantly more difficult than
the other way around. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;T &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAKED&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

This one is for you. If you can read this, consider
yourself&amp;nbsp;privileged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it might be the case that I am a terrible&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So remember that girl from Belleville from the previous Pallas posts,
Beanie, who I went with to buy some tequila. Well, this is her Beltane&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, over Friday night and Saturday, Beanie and I talked. A lot.
The more we conversed the more similar we seemed. There were times where
I had to figure out new and exciting ways to say that I felt exactly the
same way about any given&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this started out as, &amp;#8220;Don Julio/Patron is made of gold&amp;#8221; (or
blanco, as the case may be)! However, it quickly progressed to Coffee,
Tea, Politics, Relationships, Personality Types, and other important
value systems. We aligned on a lot of&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we went to get tequila, the good stuff, on Saturday afternoon. The
trip took at least an hour. During this, we exchanged the important
parts of our life stories. Though I may have grown up a troubled
individual, she definitely got the raw end of it. Her youth reminded me
most of Jessie&amp;#8217;s. Though this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to say that it was strictly
analogous. I immediately empathized&amp;nbsp;nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve never&amp;#8221; game that night, we got drunk on our Don Julio. Then
we went and sat by the bonfire. Having all warmed up, several of us took
off our shirts. I gave Beanie a massage. I think I picked up the giving
massages to people thing subconsciously from Sal &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Friends (tm). So now
I slip into it whenever I am sufficiently&amp;nbsp;tipsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this time it worked. Her tent was destroyed by ants the night
before and rain that day. I offered (utterly selflessly mind you) to
continue the massage in the my tent, and let her crash there if she
wanted. Once in my tent we ended up cuddling and talking some&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when it came out that she had delayed in telling me about her
absent boyfriend for the first day. I told her that I thought she was
swell and that I didn&amp;#8217;t want to do anything that would endanger her
relationship and that I didn&amp;#8217;t really come prepared to do anything (All
True). And that everything was in her hands. That being said, I did say
that I really wanted to make out with&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And we did. And I just might be a terrible&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And before anyone asks, her hair is shoulder length&amp;#8230;a grown out bob if
my skill does not fail me. I blame Colleen&amp;nbsp;Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I Might Be A Terrible&amp;nbsp;Person:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we fooled around, Beanie indicated that she was in some sort of
partially open (mostly closed) relationship where her boyfriend wanted
to meet the other party first. So closed. At least for purposes&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck. In this replay of the Santa Barbara fiasco, I became my nemesis!
Damnit, I willingly and knowingly did something that was a violation of
someone else&amp;#8217;s terms. This makes me an automatic shitty asshole. I swore
up and down that I would never fucking do this. What the in the god damn&amp;nbsp;hell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking with Meenon, I am convinced that I acted with a lack of
integrity. Not that there is anything I can do about it now. So from an
emotional perspective it doesn&amp;#8217;t pay to worry about it any&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry Prime in her infinite pragmatism pointed out a couple of other
essential tid bits. For instance, I understand that blaming just the
extraneous boy in these situations devalues the position of the girl.
After all, it takes two to frottage. Beanie had to want this to happen
at least as much as she didn&amp;#8217;t. This wasn&amp;#8217;t me trying to piss off some
other&amp;nbsp;guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that it is over, Kerry pointed out that I am essentially out of
the picture. What happens in their relationship is their business. I
stay the fuck back. I am not an equal partner in any of&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is frankly good advice. At the time I said I was concerned for her
and her relationship. I didn&amp;#8217;t want her to emotionally divest from her
primary partner into me. But Beanie always countered that she was
worried more about me afterwards. At the time I didn&amp;#8217;t understand what
she meant. But now I&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry also pointed out that what I did isn&amp;#8217;t technically as bad as what
had happened to me. Effectively I am just some random other penis.
However, when I was the primary partner, I lost my entire support system&amp;nbsp;overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Good Came Of&amp;nbsp;This:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is important not to understate the amount of real chemistry
that there was between Beanie and I. Ok so maybe it wasn&amp;#8217;t quite the
drop everything and run off into the sunset with me kind of thing. But
it was probably more than sufficient for the holiday romance that&amp;nbsp;ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She kept saying that she almost never trusts anyone, but for whatever
reason she trusted me. I only trust people as far as I think they trust
me. So repeating this really hit the right spots personally. I almost
never trust anyone, but because of this I trust her. Under more
sceptical circumstances, I would call this some pretty sophisticated
flirting. But I don&amp;#8217;t doubt the sincerity of it. Even if she did end up
in my&amp;nbsp;tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is this whole weird &amp;#8220;both of us are serial monogamists&amp;#8221;
thing. How the fuck did we end up together, so compromised? I am
purposefully on hiatus; trying to appease friends and family that urge
me to do something different. I even went so far as to sleep with
bullshit people to try to get them to go away. Apparently, that always
backfires. So I resolved to only be with those who I am actually
attracted to and hold some affection for. So I know why I invited her
into my tent in the first place, but why she accepted is still sort of a&amp;nbsp;mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither should it be overlooked that it has been three years since
anyone has called me sexy, out of a sense of lust. And for me to find
them attractive in return, seems like a pure Godsend. She said she would
have preferred me with a beard. She even said that my weird back hair
patches were&amp;nbsp;hot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been so long since that amazing thrill. The mental, emotional,
and tactile all came together. Even if it was for just a moment, it is
such moments that make life worth&amp;nbsp;living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t believe that I was missing that surge when you kiss someone.
Really kiss them. Not how one would kiss one&amp;#8217;s mother. But in that way
that hints &amp;#8220;Your Body, tell me more&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; No blandness, no marketing, but
the essence of&amp;nbsp;physicality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if we had gone any farther than we did, my heart would truly be
broken now. But making out is something I can do with anyone and not
feel particularly jealous or invested. However, this was, for better &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;
worse, more than just making&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;

which means that it was full of new emotions and discovering new ways of
mixing up my many varied&amp;nbsp;personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before you get too many misconceptions, most of these new folk I was
skinny dipping in the aforementioned pool with before I ever had a
conversation with them. Which conveniently brings me to my first
unexpected&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camp was fairly evenly divided between real adults and those who are
just old enough to fake it. My first serious conversation took place in
the pool with Real Adult Paul. Basically he was squeezing me for
information on what I do in graduate school and the like. So there I
was, naked in a pool, explaining fuel cycles and the importance of the
distinction between carbon emissions and environmental impact.
Meanwhile, other people were jousting on each other&amp;#8217;s shoulders. It was
fairly&amp;nbsp;surreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people seemed to think I was from Florida. I am assuming that this
comes from Ant or someone mis-telling the &amp;#8220;You Know Katy&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these was a girl called Beanie. Friday night during the revel
fire, Beanie and I discovered a shared taste for top-shelf tequila. Don
Julio was our mutual friend, while neither of us talk to Jose anymore.
Good times. We made a liquor run to satiate our&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around that self-same fire, was my first real opportunity to speak with
J. and Katya. Their relationship with each other is very &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Taming of the
Shrew&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; Moreover, they bring this brand of extrovertedness to others as
well. Here an interesting thing happened. Normally, I am the
Intro-/Extro-vert opposite of those around me. Likely because I was so
comfortable, I stepped up to the plate. With these two I felt at ease
ribbing them as much as they did me (though not quite so much as they
taunted each other).&amp;nbsp;Intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim and I were awake much later than everyone else (especially those not
copulating). Tim is a Philosopher trained in Physics and Computer
Science. We had a fuck ton to talk about. Very nice fellow and I think
we connected on a level that was unique for me&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day it rained. It was a cold rain. This did not stop people,
myself included, from running around in it and then hopping in the
slightly warmer pool. After a hot shower, under the pavilion, we played
the largest game of Apples to Apples I have ever&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday night at the revel fire, there was a similarly large game of
&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve never&amp;#8221;. You know the one where everyone puts out their hands and
goes around and says &amp;#8220;I have never slept with a manatee&amp;#8221; or some such.
Then everyone who &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; slept with a manatee puts down a finger. Etc.
Once all of your fingers are down you take a drink and get to ask a
targeted question. Those of you who know me, know that this game is my
weakness. This is, of course, when I got&amp;nbsp;drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even with the positive and relaxed atmosphere, I still felt
like some of the targeted questions were too pointed. For instance, I
was asked where I fell on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale"&gt;Kinsey Scale&lt;/a&gt;. I didn&amp;#8217;t answer because I
didn&amp;#8217;t think it applied to me. But even if it did, this is effectively
asking someone to out themselves. Which is always&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this tell-all, we warmed ourselves by the fire and then went to&amp;nbsp;bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there is a lot I am glossing over and much I am not covering
at all. But I think the above relates my emotional and mental state
throughout the weekend quite&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;

you would know that I completely broke my system while moving to the
latest stable kernel release (2.6.28). This was not without purpose; I
needed my computer to function a bit better for work and also I needed
to add iPod support since I just bought my brother&amp;#8217;s used one. Luckily,
&lt;em&gt;mah 1337 h/-\ckz0rz skillz&lt;/em&gt; came in handy and the whole process only
took me like 6 hours. It would have been less, but I only had the broken
machine on&amp;nbsp;hand!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before I go further, Pallas Beltane was amazing. I really did love
it. It was held at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rpcampground.com/"&gt;Recreation Plantation&lt;/a&gt;, which is moderately in
the boonies but has every amenity. Basically, a 40+ acre facility in the
hill&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area is zoned into three&amp;nbsp;regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up by the gate there is a light field and some trees and the house
where the proprietor&amp;nbsp;live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through a strand of oaks, there are some camp sites and hot showers
and it is generally&amp;nbsp;woody.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This falls off a 14 foot hill down to a field with a couple of
pavilions and a pool. The other border of the field is a creek (which
was&amp;nbsp;dry).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, my first thought was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The entire facility was
basically made for dressing up (or the alternative) and running around.
The fee to rent the whole place out for the weekend was like $1k. Well
within most &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I camped down by the creek with all of the other low-land gorillas.
There wasn&amp;#8217;t a lot of organized activity, but there did not really need
to be either. All in all, I had a wonderful&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADDENDUM&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Some further posts may locked as&amp;nbsp;appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

This weekend deserves a post. However, this is my third
attempt. Maybe I should hire a ghost-writer. Getting the right blend of
serious, awesome, sultry, thoughtful, hilarious is difficult. I am not
that good of a writer. I can tell you all about possible health effects
of the uranium decay chain, but this weekend&amp;#8230; Well you may as well be
up &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah_River_Site"&gt;Savannah River&lt;/a&gt; without a&amp;nbsp;paddle!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth, this should be many posts. Some of which I know how to write,
some I don&amp;#8217;t, and some I don&amp;#8217;t yet know even how I feel&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, My go-to for un-writeable posts is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/2008/04/27/"&gt;slash or fan-fic&lt;/a&gt;. I even
know what comes next. (Char/Sayla go!) But given some thoughts running
through my mind, I&amp;#8217;ll leave the incredibly disturbing sex writing to
George R. R.&amp;nbsp;Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe, when I am more awake, I will write a series of small and
pointed posts. Or maybe it will just have to wait until after&amp;nbsp;Flipside&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

It could have gone either way, but it
actually turned out pretty damn well. This pleases&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best single quote of the weekend was at the begging. I was at Guy&amp;#8217;s
Night on Friday which was pretty fun. Hanging out, watching people get
drunk, shootin&amp;#8217; the shit, &lt;em&gt;et cetera&lt;/em&gt;. At one point, and there after,
the host was babbling on the floor, out of his mind. A hilarious&amp;nbsp;drunk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anthony (not me):&lt;/strong&gt; So, man, do you &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; hangovers?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Host:&lt;/strong&gt; Like a Bachelor-and-a-Half!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly died; you just know he has been practicing that line in front
of a mirror, completely sober. Still, the most important part of Guy&amp;#8217;s
Night for me was that I got to be introverted in a very natural and
comfortable way. There was only one point where I stepped down from a
conversation that my little Extrovert was screaming out to challenge.
Both banality and evil won the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday I took a bike ride down to Town Lake, around Zilker park and
back up. It was one tasty time. But this brings up the point that I
think I am gaining most of my muscle mass right now in my legs. Which is
ok I guess. But still not quite what I was going&amp;nbsp;for&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I met up with Josh and we went to dinner (Garlic Fries and Arnold
Palmer!) and to Star Trek. I am not really going to comment on the
movie, but I will say that I have *only* found one negative review.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://grrm.livejournal.com/87221.html"&gt;It appears that George &lt;span class="caps"&gt;R. R.&lt;/span&gt; Martin thinks it kinda blew.&lt;/a&gt; He is
wrong; the movie did the one thing that movies of this sort are supposed
to do. It &lt;em&gt;entertained&lt;/em&gt; me. But still it is interesting to hear a
dissenting opinion from one of my favorite living authors. (Doubly
strange since his friend Melinda Snodgrass wrote a few Next Generation&amp;nbsp;episodes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got home from the flick, Anthony (not me, not from Guy&amp;#8217;s Night)
from Houston came into town. It was like 9:30 and we decided to hit the
town. After some pre-drinks, we walked downtown, became suitably
inebriated, went to Katz&amp;#8217;s, and walked home. It was really great to see
him and get some time to talk with him away from other&amp;nbsp;trappings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about a lot of the lameness that has occurred to both of us in
the recent past, which needs not be rehashed here. But we also talked
about a lot of the good stuff too. During this, I explained to him the
&amp;#8220;Fine Specimen of a Man&amp;#8221; conceptual continuity that has driven me for
the past few years. He, like many, took an opposing&amp;nbsp;stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his argument, from how I understand it, was much different than say
my mother&amp;#8217;s. He was lobbying that my perspective is wrong. Rather than
doing this for myself with possible side benefits to external
relationships, that I need not pursue any sort of fine specimen status
because it all boils down to &amp;#8220;Brand: Me&amp;#8221; anyways. How you sell yourself
to people is much more important than what you actually are. I actually
agree with&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am terrible at selling myself. Even to my own PhD committee. And I
am independently-minded. I want to try to look good and maybe feel
healthy because I want to know how it feels first person. I want this
transformation. I want it for me. Not for you or the world or to slut
around&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I did my usual routine and did some work. But then I went and
saw closing night or the &amp;#8220;Wheels of Wonderland&amp;#8221; show. I saw opening
night as well. Hilarious again. It is a bike/carnival/awesome themed
interpretation of &amp;#8220;Alice in Wonderland&amp;#8221;. Luckily, Anthony from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTX&lt;/span&gt; made
it in time for the show. So he took some pictures of the show and the&amp;nbsp;cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then offered to help drive this giant snake bicycle back to the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.austinbikezoo.org/"&gt;Austin Bike Zoo&lt;/a&gt;. This entailed some loading and unloading but was
generally an awesome experience. But then Anthony wanted to eat and I
needed coffee so we crashed their cast party at this Vietnamese&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I replaced a Tootsie Roll Pop that I had stolen the weekend&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony and I went home, played a little &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DWG2&lt;/span&gt;, watched some movies
online and&amp;nbsp;crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty rock solid few days. I am&amp;nbsp;appeased.&lt;/p&gt;

But I also feel that
anything I write will be incomplete until the weekend is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those of you who don&amp;#8217;t know, I passed my PhD Proposal Defense on
Tuesday. So other than some coursework, this was literally my last
hurdle before I go up to defend the real deal next May! &lt;em&gt;crosses&amp;nbsp;fingers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience left me drained more than excited. But in celebration, I
ate some things that I knew would hurt my stomach. And they did.
However, I resisted buying Newman-O&amp;#8217;s. Chocolate is almost entirely out
of my diet. For shame. I *love*&amp;nbsp;chocolate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I feel that my private life is moving in the right
direction. ::knock on wood:: Garrick made a comment a while back that
went something along the lines of me being &amp;#8220;75% recovered&amp;#8221;. I took
exception to that at the time, but now I think I know what he was
driving at. Hopefully I am closer. Garrick also has a way of sticking
numbers to things which really ain&amp;#8217;t got no business havin&amp;#8217; numbers on&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So between the PhD drain and the private positives, I feel very manic
when I am alone. Whatever recent experience my mind decides to replay is
what emotional state I fall into. Here&amp;#8217;s to the next couple of days
bringing more good things to focus on for the week&amp;nbsp;ahead!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodnight, Austin, Texas where ever you&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is an update of the latest batch of hilarious messages that
people have sent Jessica (bi/f) and Mark&amp;nbsp;(gay/m).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your profile didn&amp;#8217;t really say, so I am wondering what you are looking
for right&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3 to Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ha. That pic of you two in black with cowboy hats &amp;#8212; looks like y&amp;#8217;all are Siamese twins. Oh well. A man can dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;i spotted a bear flag and I agree with everyone else&amp;#8217;s reaction on that adorable mustache. What&amp;#8217;s up? Hugs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Hi I read your profile and I like what is there. I am new to Texas and I love it here so far. I love to dance and not very good at it, but do it for fun. I would like to find someone to have fun with. You look like that person. I am not that good looking, but am losing weight. check out my profile and let me know what you think.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I am interested in getting to know more about you sexy thing you. I hope that we can get to know more about each other and see where things end up.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then, Three Months Later&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love your profile and pics. You are soo sexy. Wanna chat?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again the litmus test of my life reveals that only gay men
covet my&amp;nbsp;assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So favorites, everyone? Post a comment telling the world which one you
like the most! Mine is either #3 or&amp;nbsp;#7.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Welcome! I
write to my audience, both seen and secret. So in honor of this I will
write an entirely selfish&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The noun-phrase of the day is &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Body Fat Percentage&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, we all know I have weird physiology. Still my quest to become a
fine specimen continues. I reached my target weight years ago, but
because of these strange and previously unknown dietary issues, it
hardly ever looked like it. As it is, I still think I look over my
actual weight and fitness&amp;#8230;which is&amp;nbsp;unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But moving on, weight isn&amp;#8217;t everything. Muscle mass is (once you are
within 10 pounds or so) just as important. Because I can feel them and
have been doing specific exercises, I know I have some decent abdominal
muscles. The goal now is to get them&amp;nbsp;visible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.takefit.com/212/how-low-does-my-body-fat-percentage-need-to-be-before-my-abs-will-become-visible/"&gt;men need a body fat percentage of about 10%&lt;/a&gt;. Women, lucky
for them and their other assets, need between 14% and 18% to have
visible&amp;nbsp;abs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently estimated at about 15% &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.linear-software.com/online.html"&gt;Body Fat&lt;/a&gt;. So really, I need to
loose 5% body fat, which at my current weight shakes out to 7&amp;nbsp;pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok cool, not hard right? But wait! This isn&amp;#8217;t really loosing 7 pounds,
Mr Slimfat. This is more like converting 7 pounds of fat into 7 pounds
of muscle. Or at least some combination of loosing weight while
maintaining or gaining muscle&amp;nbsp;mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is tricky. Loosing weight (through diet and exercise, of course) is
mostly done through aerobic exercise. On the other hand, increasing
muscle mass is done through anaerobic exercise. And there are only so
many hours in the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it turns out that doing anaerobic workouts &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; aerobic ones
increases the value of both rather than the other way around. This has
been precisely my strategy for a while now. But it became clear that I
needed even more aerobic exercise throughout the day. This has been
gained by riding my bike more now that the weather is good, rather than
walking &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I found this website called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.fatsecret.com/"&gt;FatSecret&lt;/a&gt; which lets you
input everything you eat in a day to your profile. It will automatically
calculate a kilocalorie estimate for you. Neat! There is a real barrier
to excess food if you then have to account for it by typing it into a
website later that&amp;nbsp;day&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even better than that, you also can put in what work outs you have
done day-by-day and it will estimate the kilocalories burned. It even
accounts automatically for the energy used by sleeping or just being&amp;nbsp;awake!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it outputs a daily side by side summary table of what energy came
in and what energy left. Since it takes 3500 kilocalories net-burned to
loose a pound, this is super useful for getting a rough estimate of how
you are&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I thought about writing a program to do basically the same
thing a couple of years ago. But since they couple it to much larger
databases than I have, they ship a better product than I have time to&amp;nbsp;write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to attain fine specimen of a man status by my birthday! I
think I can. I have the time, will, and&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the most incredible&amp;nbsp;weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image0" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SfTQ4God7iI/AAAAAAAAAx4/76W-48pBtv4/s800/DrumCircle.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it started off of Friday night with me sending out my PhD Proposal.
This, of course, left me a stringless, dessicated husk of a man.
Therefore I proceeded to go to a show at the Vortex called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/review?oid=oid%3A767636"&gt;Mr. Z Loves Company&lt;/a&gt;.
I went with my friend Jayme. It was amazing. I guess the show
was about Mr. Z&amp;#8217;s repressed&amp;nbsp;homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Austin Chronicle points out, it wasn&amp;#8217;t necessarily amazing
because of the shock factor, but because it was so well done. To set the
mood, with a vat of Crisco, Mr. Z sticks a 12 foot long dildo up
himself. And other, than the maid orgy opening song and dance, Mr. Z&amp;#8217;s
anal antics were by far the most tame of the&amp;nbsp;show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved it! I mean, how often can you pay to see that sort of thing. And
so cheap! I continue to be impressed by the&amp;nbsp;Vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, the next day, Saturday, came &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://eeyores.org/"&gt;Eeyore&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore%27s_Birthday_Party"&gt;Birthday&lt;/a&gt;. This is
a big hippie bash where people come all dressed up with their freak
kids. Fucking Incredible. The picture above is of the drum circle that I
jumped in and out of many times. Dancing =&amp;nbsp;Hardcore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the hell I missed this the previous two years I have no idea! It
takes place in the park right down the street from me. With thousands of
people! I only knew about it this year because of Jayme told me the
night before after Mr. Z&amp;#8217;s (See how this all ties in?) Next year,
everyone? Seriously, I took a picture with Twinky&amp;nbsp;Freidman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image1" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_KFdIKJVlj1w/SfTQ5rFxEMI/AAAAAAAAAyI/EJQf8c6XaXo/s800/MeAndTwinkyFreidman.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my sweet lord, the women! You know how I get excitable when I find
one girl who outwardly breaks enough norms for me to be interested in
them. This was like swimming through a sea of them! Is this what it is
like to be straight-laced? That almost makes me want to be normal.

I don&amp;#8217;t know. Maybe I am
unsettled with my visage in general and the beard is an easy point of
contention. Maybe I will become a three pronged rock-lobster. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANYTHING&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POSSIBLE&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOLLOW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOUR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DREAMS&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of the latest rash of sexless work, I have been Gundam focused
recently. If this starts to turn you off, don&amp;#8217;t stop reading, I swear
this relates back to the real world and gets&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so the first series I finished within the past month was &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Fighter_G_Gundam"&gt;G
Gundam&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. It. was. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwyVV5_orBo"&gt;awful&lt;/a&gt;. Now that we have an understanding, there
were exactly two points of significant&amp;nbsp;interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; The main plot revolved around an evil machine (lit. called Devil
Gundam) and its supporters that was out to destroy humanity in order to
give the Earth time to heal. Sort of a post-apocalyptic eco-terrorist
Dragon Ball Z. Almost but not quite worth it. However, at the end, one
of the main bad guys eventually comes around and understands that humans
are also a product of nature, and trying to destroy them as an unnatural
blight is&amp;nbsp;oxymoronic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of Earth Day, this is particularly interesting. For a while I
have been struggling with the fact that some of the assumptions that the
Green movement makes seem to be founded in this &amp;#8220;People are Wrong&amp;#8221;
attitude. The whole idea behind Zero Population Growth is founded in
this. Now what they really mean is that poorer people, people with
different political ideologies, and people who tend to have darker skin
should stop breeding. But Sweet Char Aznable, if Master Asia in some
Japanese kids show can understand that humanity is a natural phenomena
than they should be able to as&amp;nbsp;well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to make a point about not impacting their environment,
then they should become a vegetarian, or stop driving or flying, or just
let themselves die if they feel that strongly about it.&amp;nbsp;/sigh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; The other point where G Gundam gets props is that one of the
supporting men isn&amp;#8217;t. They do a very
good job of covering up the fact that George de Sand (of Neo France)
is probably a woman. They did name the character after &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sand"&gt;George Sand&lt;/a&gt;,
the male pen name of a famous French woman author. The real person took
the name to get published; the cartoon character probably took the name
to participate in the inane Gundam&amp;nbsp;fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other evidence includes the fact the George de Sand uses a special
attack called &amp;#8220;Rose Bits&amp;#8221; which is very very similar to the funnel
attacks used in previous series by exclusively female characters.
Moreover, even though the French princess in completely enamoured with
George, s/he seems not to care. George expresses multiple times that he
is only fighting on her behalf because it is what is expected as the
representative knight of his&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applaud such gender subversion aimed at 10 year old&amp;nbsp;boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next series I watched was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_Wing"&gt;Gundam Wing&lt;/a&gt;. If you follow my twitter,
you have seen a lot of hilarious stuff on this. However, the theme of
this more serious series was whether the use of robots in war was&amp;nbsp;permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to be headed down this road (unmanned drones, etc) so it will
likely come up. Naturally, the argument for is that robots will make
your war clean and efficient (as long as you trust who is running them).
The argument against is that it takes the humanity out of war. More than
just the nothing wagered, nothing lost, the characters in the series
seemed obsessed with human suffering. Mechatronics cheapening all
prospects of real&amp;nbsp;pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is arming little robots as we speak. There hasn&amp;#8217;t
really been a debate about the ethics of this. Much like the name of the
game is ICBMs these days, I doubt there will be. But maybe there should
be. I think I would rather be shot down by a soldier than an overgrown&amp;nbsp;roomba.&lt;/p&gt;

My &lt;span class="caps"&gt;K.D.&lt;/span&gt; Lang-ing
has gotten out of hand. Every day or two I am intensely broken-hearted.
I am not sure if this desire is really justified. I feel that there is
and was a connection and that is certainly important. Meanwhile, in a
cruel twist of fate, the Austin populous has gotten significantly
hotter. Would it be right to pass up Austin opportunities just for a
chance to record on her album? Fuck, are there Austin opportunities?
Will there be a rally in&amp;nbsp;Raleigh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because they are foxier doesn&amp;#8217;t mean they are anymore available,
were I the last girl on Earth. The Economist: &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;The city&amp;#8217;s dykes mostly
stood firm.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; If only they were talking about womenfolk. Or&amp;nbsp;Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanna be whomever she want me to be. But I don&amp;#8217;t know who that is. I
don&amp;#8217;t think we ever really find out who our partners want us to be. We
simply get better at&amp;nbsp;guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; answer to this question is to just be myself! But like that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foxx6X9k3hQ"&gt;the Who song&lt;/a&gt;, my definition of self is so fluid it is hard for me to
pin down. If you have been the test subject of my recent beard/no-beard
rants, I apologize. Or if you have ever been clothes shopping with me,
you also know this. Every article is a statement of&amp;nbsp;purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so much easier to just adjust to someone&amp;#8217;s expectations. But I
have to respect that person, and they have to be at least as deviant as
I am. I fucking wasn&amp;#8217;t always this way. I used to just not care. But the
joys of social engineering have ruined such apathy for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like a fat lump of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Gundanium_Alloy"&gt;Gundamium&lt;/a&gt; (a lame, non-existent plot
device) without her. She knows who Yusaf Islam is and my heart grows
fonder with every&amp;nbsp;mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh &lt;span class="caps"&gt;K.D.&lt;/span&gt; Lang, are you just a unicorn?! I look forward to the day when I
may cry &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTv9m8c6hnw"&gt;Hallelujah!&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I meet with my adviser again on Tuesday. Coincidentally, this is when a
series of Mobile Suits will save me. Mostly I was really looking forward
last week to not having to write a lick in this week. But no. Because of
suckage and revisions I will have to spend another half of a week&amp;nbsp;writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even more than that, I want to be anywhere but here. It has rained
on my day off for the past two weeks. And of course the rest of the week
it is sunny and amazing. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAME&lt;/span&gt;. I could say that I don&amp;#8217; know why Austin
became so negative and other places so positive, but that would be a
lie. Do you want to hear a poor, sad&amp;nbsp;lie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then moon is made of cheese and I don&amp;#8217;t know why Austin became so
negative!&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there remains hope. I think that when I come back from the summer
the situation will be a lot better. Moreover, I fucking get to leave for
the summer! I am sorely tempted to start this a month early and just
leave now. I don&amp;#8217;t even have anywhere to go. Great! Even better. I have
a tent. And a bear barrel. Bring it. As cool as you are Austin, you are
city filled with people, who are sometimes&amp;nbsp;lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am altogether to sensitive to my surroundings. That would
explain a lot. It explains why I need positive individuals. Barring
that, the cold comfort of strangers is superior to any sort of
negativity. But even better than that is no one at&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So meanwhile, in the intervening month, my bike is muddy and I am only
sated by mid-nineties slash. But tomorrow, or tomorrow tomorrow, or
tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow, I will be gone, fighting for peace. Get well
while I am&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is exactly the kind of post you&amp;nbsp;hate.&lt;/p&gt;

extremely hard on something that you generally feel is a distraction.
Then after such a herculean effort, the further ability to fully admit
that this thing that you just built completely and utterly sucks.
Congratulations, you have just made a worthless piece of&amp;nbsp;crap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean you had the inkling before hand that it might have sucked a
little. I mean you have done this before, right? You know some of the
pitfalls&amp;#8230;but not all of them. And after all, that is what editing is
for. To catch this stuff before you embarrass yourself in front of any
one except your adviser. Someday, though.&amp;nbsp;Someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, you just might get it right on the first try. After all, you
can at least fake being smart. And you have this &lt;em&gt;corpus&lt;/em&gt; of work behind
that proves that you might have known something at some point in the
past. This time it can&amp;#8217;t be that hard to bust out,&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, think what you have sacrificed. You don&amp;#8217;t have any friends. No
social life to speak of. A few hours on Friday nights and Saturdays
spent doing chores. You haven&amp;#8217;t had sex, let alone good sex, in years.
And the words that you pen are only fit for burning. This hardly seems
worth&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeeze, am I glad that I am not some of my&amp;nbsp;colleagues!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I noticed that the words in the little boxes formed word phrase
primitives. Sweet! So I put a few cards together and then spun a quarter

know you are not interested in. That being said, what one wants and what
one thinks one wants are typically quite disparate when one starts
dating. So like many things in my life I have followed a classic
iteration, hopefully converging on that one person who is so molto bene
that you don&amp;#8217;t risk giving them&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The point whole point is that date dissimilar people who gradually get
closer and closer to one another and you learn more and more what works
for you and what&amp;nbsp;doesn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example: Say you start off with the girl down the street. You should
then probably move to the one from the wrong side of the tracks. The
difference here is large because you don&amp;#8217;t have any sense of who you
are. Then try to find someone who is a more middling version. Someone
who roughly combines the positive traits from each. Maybe you decide
that you liked the girl down the street a bit more so you find someone
that more closely resembles them. However, this fails and you suspect
you need a real man, more like Duncan Idaho and less like Lady Jessica.
Look we are getting closer; they are both strong character from Dune!
While trying to decide if Elvis is alive or not you think that someone
more enigmatic would be better to project your feelings on. Then you
wonder if mythical beasts in a far way land are enigmatic enough for&amp;nbsp;you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe all of these characterizations are grossly unfair (half of
them don&amp;#8217;t exist), but the method is sound. From each encounter you
learn, and get closer and closer to that mythical one (or several, as
the case may&amp;nbsp;be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is did this come up? Well, blame Kerry Prime. She pointed out how
she is holding out hope that I might someday bring home a nice, only
slightly unusual, girl. Sean, for one, has for years claimed that I will
marry a nice Jewish girl (uuugh, curse my bones he&amp;nbsp;does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being single for some time, I dated around to humor the &amp;#8220;open up your
options, put yourself out there, don&amp;#8217;t limit yourself&amp;#8221; crowd. But, it
failed (in a non-self-fulfilling way). I know more or less what I want.
I have converged to within acceptable tolerances, yet, of course, I can
always go&amp;nbsp;further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while I am intrigued by the possibility of someone that my friends
and family think is a good fit but is outside of *my* norm, I
sincerely doubt it will happen. It defeats the purpose of doing the
iteration to break out of the loop&amp;nbsp;now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I take a similar model for other aspects of my life. Check&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

Last weekend I went to Gainesville for a conference. I was expecting
it to suck (as per last year) and therefore I would get some time to
post. But no! It was freaking fantastic. Here is the fallout. Ok maybe
fallout isn&amp;#8217;t the best term for a nuclear engineering&amp;nbsp;congress&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems as if the Austin Experiment turned out to be the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028950/"&gt;Grand
Illusion&lt;/a&gt;. I expected to be more upset, I suppose, but really, it is
another data point in the convergence loop of my life (more on this&amp;nbsp;later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than being all bent out of the shape, I am determined to go
North of the Wall and maybe find me a unicorn or something. Really I
only have &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://scopatz.doesntexist.com/1/"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; more year here in Austin and then the entire world is
open to me! How fucking pimp is that?! Yo,&amp;nbsp;werd!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More seriously, I can easily fill a year with research. I can think of
at least 4 full papers that I want to write in the next year. Hopefully
at least two of these will pan&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is clear that the conference motivated me. Good. It&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have about a month before I go up to defend my PhD proposal. Luckily,
I have so many potential avenues to exploit, writing the document in the
next week and half, shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a problem in the least. It is looking
like I am gonna do this thing; I am going to get my PhD!&amp;nbsp;Victory!&lt;/p&gt;

want to keep the &amp;#8216;avilin&amp;#8217; username. I made that mistake with&amp;nbsp;Yahoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adios, people on the internet in Austin, Texas who want nothing to do
with&amp;nbsp;me!&lt;/p&gt;
</summary></entry><entry><title>If you arenât my LJ friend, this oneâs toÂ you!</title><link href="http://anthony.scopatz.com/if-you-arent-my-lj-friend-this-ones-to-you.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-03-19T20:22:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Anthony Scopatz</name></author><id>tag:anthony.scopatz.com,2009-03-19:if-you-arent-my-lj-friend-this-ones-to-you.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I made a post which you don&amp;#8217;t get to read, world. As much as I love
you Google, perhaps I don&amp;#8217;t want to be in the middle of your three-way
with Yahoo! and Microsoft with absolutely all of my&amp;nbsp;thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no worries! Here is some keen information that you totally need to
know about me, like for sure&amp;nbsp;man/dude/guy/hypno-toad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of sleepless knights ago, I was wanting to read something as I
crawled into bed. However, I was in the rare mood of not wanting to read
any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRRM&lt;/span&gt; before I went to sleep. So I picked up my copy of Alfred, Lord
Tennyson&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Idylls of the King&amp;#8221; and took a stab at it once&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, this time it clicked. This time through everything
makes sense and I am able to read it unhitched. And it is amazing. First
off, I noticed keenly that it is not &amp;#8220;The Idylls of the King&amp;#8221;, but
rather Tennyson&amp;#8217;s idles about King Aurthur. Tennyson himself is in
possession of the idylls, not Aurthur. A mistaken presumption that I was
under&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it took him about 40 yeas to write, a Virgil-ent&amp;nbsp;feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, there are portions of the epic that just jump out at me as some
of the most beautiful examples of English that I have ever seen.
Considering it is on a chiefly British fairy tale, such examples are all
the more native to the&amp;nbsp;tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a couple of my favorite&amp;nbsp;quotes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Tennyson retelling, though Aurthur sees Guinevere once before he
marries her, he never speaks to her. Moreover, as Aurthur was simply
dressed when he saw her, Guinevere has never even seen the good King
before the marriage. Their vows are&amp;nbsp;magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And Aurthur said, &amp;#8220;Behold, thy doom is mine.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8220;King and my lord, I love thee to the death!&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! &amp;#8220;Thy doom is mine!&amp;#8221; typically forebears someone getting their ass
handed to them in battle, but it is *somehow* more powerful as wedding
words. On the one hand this is the sort of sappy love-at-first sight
mumbo that one would expect from a Romatic poet. On the other hand, you
might think that whenever someone professes so strongly like this it can
&lt;strong&gt;only end badly&lt;/strong&gt;, like Romeo and Juliet. And then you remember, &amp;#8220;Hey,
this is King Aurthur. That is Queen Guinevere. This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOES&lt;/span&gt; end badly! Al,
I see what you did&amp;nbsp;there&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to an important point. Does anyone else think that
Aurthur in these legends is curiously indifferent to his wife&amp;#8217;s
infidelity? This has always bothered me, but I think that in retrospect,
it sort of doesn&amp;#8217;t matter to him. I mean he is trying to drive out
heathens and find the Holy Grail and much more important works than the
love of one woman and the dishonor of one knight. Moreover, he keeps his
initial vow to the letter. Later after he has failed in his greater
tasks he comes back and besieges Lancelot, and fails. Lancelot is
allowed to live out life as a hermit and Guinevere becomes a nun, light
penance compared to being burned to death (Ser Mordred&amp;#8217;s initial
sentence). Isn&amp;#8217;t that kinda weird? I mean we stress fidelity a lot in
this culture. Everyone else makes much a-do about the adultery, except
for Aurthur.&amp;nbsp;Strange&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other favorite quote is about Ser Gareth (Arthur&amp;#8217;s nephew) being
forced to work in the Camelot kitchens (by his mother) for a year and a
day before he may ascend to&amp;nbsp;knighthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So Gareth all for glory underwent&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The sooty yoke of kitchen-vassalage,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So awesome. Gareth is kind of a puss so I am not a huge fan, but the
brother knows how to take a sooty yoke in&amp;nbsp;stride!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have always been much more of a Homeric fan than
Arthurian. I have read the Iliad enough to call it an old friend and the
Odyssey a shameful amount rarely rereading a translation. Yes, even more
times than my current seven run-throughs of &amp;#8220;A Song of Ice and&amp;nbsp;Fire&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something about the libertine attitudes of Homer that make
everything more adventurous and dangerous than the stiff hierarchy of a
medieval court. In Homer, people go places, do things, and die. In
Arthurian tales, they walk around England spoiling for unbelievers to
kill (good) and a cup (meh) and the Queen takes a consort and everyone
gets real upset except for the King who says &amp;#8220;Meh, I am busy looking for
this cup right&amp;nbsp;now.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, I like the King Aurthur stories as much as anyone
(especially Sir Gawain and the Green Knight). But they lack the
independent streak of Robin Hood and the supernatural badass of Beowulf.
Rather they are cool like Faust. (Does this make Malory hot like&amp;nbsp;Goethe?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for whatever reason, for now Tennyson has rekindled my feudal
passions&amp;nbsp;knightly!&lt;/p&gt;

Haven&amp;#8217;t seen you in a while &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LJ&lt;/span&gt;. How have you been? What have you
been up&amp;nbsp;to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me? Oh not much&amp;nbsp;really&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less the past month was awful. Pretty much since my parental
unit left Austin (in February) has seen a near complete collapse deep in
the&amp;nbsp;heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. My roommate has been a wellspring of negativity of late. Normally, I
try to let him pass in me and through me for fear is mind killer. Fear
is the little death that brings total&amp;nbsp;obliteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Work has nearly killed me. I know I have said this in the past. But
those times I expected to be working. I feel like I haven&amp;#8217;t gotten a
break (though I had that week in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; in February) since&amp;nbsp;mid-November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. With a notable, apathetic exception I felt abandoned by the peeps in
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATX&lt;/span&gt;. And no, I do not mean the delicious sugar coated puffy sugar
Easter-time&amp;nbsp;treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had two severe consequences (and a bunch of minor ones, like
stopping me from&amp;nbsp;blogging):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. I started playing WoW again. I wanted to see new content from &amp;#8216;Wrath
of the Lich King&amp;#8217; but since I am leveling with a friend, I have yet to
even buy the expansion =/. But I am back on Argent Dawn. Which is sort
of surreal, but it is pretty much the way I left&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. I stopped sleeping. I have completely missed three nights of sleep
this week. And this is spring break! I have yet to make it up during the
time that I have been&amp;nbsp;sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper I was writing I submitted on Sunday night. Since then, I have
had a little bit of time to try to get my house in order. From what I
can tell, it has partially worked. The friend group tension may have
settled down a bit. The roommate spigot may not be dripping my way for
the nonce. And school has settled since the mad month dash to the paper
is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can work on rebuilding (and sleeping), rather than
self-flagellation to relieve pressure. Not that there aren&amp;#8217;t still
problems but I am looking forward and trying to put a positive spin on&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am sitting here in a coffee house that I have never been to and
trying to figure the future out. Most people have five and ten year
visionary plans. As do I. However, I think what I need is a bridge plan.
A one-and-a-half year plan, if you will. Something that will get me
through the remainder of my foreseeable tenure in&amp;nbsp;Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My recent feelings of abandonment brought this into (house) stark
relief. I need, need, need the kind of support that I just am not
currently getting. I have decided in some earnest to start dating&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All attempts with online pursuits have failed, quietly. So I am gonna
have to do this the old-fashioned way. Which is fine by me. There are a
number of systematic barriers to this (working six days a week, using
Latin phrases in normal speech, et al). I feel that a many of these can
be hurdled permanently or systematically. But beyond clubbing and
returning to the cave-den forthwith, what are these ancient&amp;nbsp;mechanisms?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to go back to the archaic technique of getting out there,
doing activities, and generally meeting people (research permitting).
Sadly my 1.5 year plan as it stands is mostly devoid of such activities.
So I need &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOUR&lt;/span&gt; help. Here is the applicable part of the list, please
comment and add things that you think I might enjoy doing. Specifically
things that get me closer to the sexy deviants out&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1. Go on Sierra Club sponsored hikes etc.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2. Going to Schule more often.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither of these seem like real winners in the getting out there scheme
of things. But they might be help. Please I need help. I think I have
this academic problem of tending towards solitary activities. If I act,
I act scholastically. This manifestly evident by my late night research
into Sir Bedivere&amp;#8217;s heraldry. &amp;#8220;Fly my pretty priests!&amp;nbsp;Fly!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

take in it certainly avoided me for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two instances where
this comes up. The first is when Syrio is training Arya for the first time [1].
He notes that after he tells to hold the practice sword in one hand, she goes
for the left. The next instance where this comes up that I have found is all
the way in &amp;#8220;A Feast for Crows&amp;#8221;. As she first arrives in Braavos, Arya wears a
&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;dagger on her left hip and Needle on her right.&amp;#8221; Since you keep
weapons on the opposite side of the hand you use them in, this is more
proof that she is&amp;nbsp;left-handed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the best of my knowledge, I don&amp;#8217;t know of any other explicitly
left-handed characters. Though I would certainly be interested if
someone could find&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has been going on lately. After my vacation to the west coast, a
week later my parental unit (mother, father, and grandmother) visited
for a week. While all of this was quite exciting, pleasant, and needed I
am now far behind on real work. Not hopelessly so, but still. Since my
parents were leaving on Saturday, I decided to take the rest of Shabbat
off and relax. This turned out to be kind of a&amp;nbsp;disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I invited one of my friends over,
but was&amp;nbsp;abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I desperately need to speak to one
of Varys agents, but have not recently had the&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am poor because the Birthright
deposit wiped me out. Yes it is free. Yes there is a deposit. And yes I
plan to go, though it is with my brother. I wouldn&amp;#8217;t go&amp;nbsp;alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I haven&amp;#8217;t been as interested in
dating lately. But as my coz points out, this could just be that my
parental unit was in&amp;nbsp;town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I have been having strange,
reoccurring dreams lately. By which I mean nightmares. They are, more or
less, me watching a fight between Duncan Idaho from &amp;#8220;Dune&amp;#8221; and Cpt. Ahab
as played by Gregory Peck from &amp;#8220;Moby Dick&amp;#8221;. Frankly, they need to&amp;nbsp;stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I received an unexpected email from
an old friend. I responded but have heard no further&amp;nbsp;reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I have, through this delirium, been
wondering at the validity of online dating. Maybe it is just making me
think I am putting myself out there while I actually am not. I am not
getting any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; I am not doing any in the flesh flirting. I mean, maybe
I never did. I used to think that any sex, even bad sex, still was worth
it on some level (new experiences, etc). Since I have reversed decision
I feel like I have an obligation to myself to go out in active search of
things that I enjoy. But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEY&lt;/span&gt;! Guess who is super busy and whose parents
are in&amp;nbsp;town?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I realized today that I don&amp;#8217;t have
any hobbies that involve other people or that can&amp;#8217;t be done alone. This
should probably&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note, I should probably get some sleep. Why that homework
took me 20 hours of which I will probably only get a 50% on, I will

&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re beautiful, you have a great personality, and youre highly sexual.
You&amp;#8217;re a liberal with your views and you don&amp;#8217;t put morals before
everything. You&amp;#8217;re probably a great wife or girlfriend, and you know how
to make sure that the ones you love are happy. You&amp;#8217;re probably fun in a

So I thought
I would address it here, privately. As fate has it, the I get to squeeze
out some time to right this on the night after Valentines&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, on my trip back to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; I was grilled pretty heavily on the
dating issue. Being the social butterfly effect theorist that I am, I
was more than willing to listen to every one&amp;#8217;s opinions and pipe up when
I disagreed. But still, there is a lot of advice out there advocating a
lot of approaches many of which seem to counter balance one another.
Let&amp;#8217;s start with beliefs that are in the&amp;nbsp;consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I should be dating now:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, even I have come around to this
point of view. Finally. Seeing where being single gets me, it is&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I should expand the set of whom I am interested in:&lt;/strong&gt; I actually
beat most folks to the punch on this&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light dating is part of &amp;#8220;the game&amp;#8221; before finding a serious
partner:&lt;/strong&gt; Not something I am particularly interested, but I agree it
is likely&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are institutional barriers to dating:&lt;/strong&gt; The friend group in
Austin, the amount I am out of town, how busy I am with school, and
the amount my family visits all pose significant difficulties towards
meeting new people where I live and getting out (around here)&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok now that we all agree on that we should talk about the things there
are a wide range of opinions on. A while back, Julie posted a thing on
her &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LJ&lt;/span&gt; that was a list of qualities that she would like to see in her
partner. Rather than doing anything like that, or a more advanced
version with some sort of point system, I am just going to talk about
what people told&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely the biggest issue of them all is that of my deviance kink.
(After some introspection: I am renaming the Short-Hair Fetish to the
deviance kink. I was raised in a very &amp;#8220;Its Normal To Be Different&amp;#8221; way.
So Rather than latching onto the normal stuff, I latch onto the
different stuff. Short hair on women signifies many possibilites, but
all of them imply a level of independence and deviance. And it is
totally obvious without even having to talk to the person.) Not that by
any means I am attacted to all deviants or all types of deviants or
exclusively to deviants. However, there are serious doubts in my mind
that I could be happy in a long term relationship with someone who
didn&amp;#8217;t challenge to social&amp;nbsp;norm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is why, to all those peeps who have told me/thought that I
should to give up/expand the short hair fetish, I got so indignant. I
took it as asking me to give up this &lt;em&gt;very central aspect of my
personality&lt;/em&gt;. Which under no circumstances am I willingly renouncing.
Because it is convenient, lets take the hair thing again. I am very
attracted to some people with long hair, but these gems have something
to sweeten the pot. Like LARPing or, being a hot goth or punk or metal
chick, or hell, even being Jewish is deviant enough. And I am open to
other forms too. In summary, many people think I should drop the 20% of
girls and go after the 80% that are more normal and play the numbers a
bit better. I&amp;nbsp;disagree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the dating strategy I should employ has had several
different recommendations. Shawn suggests bars and clubs and parties. My
cousins suggests vigorous online database lurking (though with different
methods). Basically everyone agrees that my chances would be better in
Southern California though. I really don&amp;#8217;t know what strategy I am
comfortable with. Bars seem sleazy and online only seems lazy. And the
magical third option of doing various activities to get out more and
meet people is impacted by time constraints. I will likely have to
implore all&amp;nbsp;three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acceptable range of personality types people also disagree on. I
don&amp;#8217;t really know what I want here either. I think I am more interested
in someone who is extroverted so that I can be introverted. And someone
who is artsy and/or academic, though these are not deal breakers. My
personality is so fluid that it is possible that the recommendations
that people give me are based on what type they perceive me as. There is
absolutely no consensus here. What is really most important to me is
that they are attracted to me and my many sides, not a particular&amp;nbsp;projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is more that I could talk about that people disagree on. Should it
be requirement for me me to think my partner is hot (and is this a
female or male trait) or is that just thinking with my dick because
appearances will change over the long haul? Is it important for the
partner to get along with my family? Friends? Are some fiends opinions
valued more highly than others? Am I attractive enough? What does that
even mean? Am I to the people I want to date? Am I confident enough to
approach them? Am I deviant enough? What the hell happens when I get out
of school? Do leagues (eg &amp;#8216;outta my league&amp;#8217;) even exist? The problem
gets insurmountably&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though a series of light relationships is not what I am looking
for, they may answer some of these questions. On some level this is
resetting me to square one, which is rather humbling considering all of
my past relationships. I thought I was past this stage. I didn&amp;#8217;t ask to
be sent back here. But there is no point in being bitter at life. A
series of light relationships is better than being in no relationship, I
just need to find&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

But I did eat a lot of&amp;nbsp;bread!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUT&lt;/span&gt; I am back in Austin! I had an excellent time on my vacation. You may
have noticed the near radio (internet) silence on my end in the past
week. Here is what I was&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew out to Santa Barbara on Friday and had dinner with my Grandmother
and parents and then went back to the Santa Ynez Valley and crashed for
the evening. I got to see stars and mountains and cats and dogs and the
country and everything was&amp;nbsp;awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day I drove up to Walnut Creek (in the Bay Area) and hung out
with Sean and Christen and their friends from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSC&lt;/span&gt;, Zach and Heather and
Sean&amp;#8217;s Robotics team. We went to Dave &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Busters and generally had a good
time and then went home and crashed. But not before throwing out Sean
and Christen&amp;#8217;s Christmas tree at 2 am on February 1st&amp;nbsp;~_~.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, I drove down to Morgan Hill (my High School Stomping grounds,
still in the Bay) to hang out with Kerry Prime, Ryan, and Garrick. We
went to Super Taqueria and then played &amp;#8220;Magnet X&amp;#8221; while hanging out.
Together the three of them managed to decipher what both Super Secret
Projects are. We also drove by a Swedish outpost in the hills and some
petrogylphs left by the natives. Kerry and Ryan (whose anniversary we
were crashing) had to get back to the City so they left at around 5-6pm.
Garrick and I then went to drop in on Sean&amp;#8217;s folks place to say goodbye
to Sean and Christen and &amp;#8220;Hi&amp;#8221; to his parents. Garrick and I then went to
dinner at Black Bear in Gilroy where he quizzed me on girl issues. Then
I drove back to Santa Ynez to sleep at my&amp;nbsp;folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day , Monday, I hung out with my cousin Aaron in his Chemistry
lab at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSB&lt;/span&gt;. Randomly, I got to see one of my undergraduate research
advisers, Kevin Plaxco, who happens to be Aaron&amp;#8217;s for-real adviser. That
was nice. I watched Aaron do some research and we walked around campus
and Goleta Beach. I saw the sun set over a familiar ocean. I could see
Anacapa Island almost perfectly. Oh and we had the lunch buffet at
Flavor of&amp;nbsp;India!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I went down to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;, hoping to see Meenon. Unfortunately, I
couldn&amp;#8217;t see her until 11 pm (after she got off of work). So I ended up
in the Valley with nothing to do for four hours. After a couple of hours
of humming and hawing, and Andrew calling me &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;So Fucking Shy
Sometimes!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; (See &lt;strong&gt;Introvert&lt;/strong&gt;!), I called up my friends. Mowi and Twin
got to me first and we ended up having dinner at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BJ&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s. We had a good
time and talked about past and recent events, though we tried to avoid
that line of conversation for like an&amp;nbsp;hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did then finally go to Meenon&amp;#8217;s place in Culver City. She and Jesse
and I hung out until it was time to go to sleep. Unfortunately, Maggie&amp;#8217;s
father went into the hospital, so I did not get to see her&amp;nbsp;=(.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day was a planning disaster. With nothing to do and no where to
go, I went to Hollywood and bought prudy pictures (movie stills and
posters) from a shop there. Then I settled into a Starbucks for some
internet time. About half and hour in, my Aunt Chris calls and invites
me back up to the Valley for dinner with her and my Uncle Bruce. I make
the drive *right* before rush hour! After I visit with them for the
evening, I drive down to Irvine to see their son, my cousin Andrew. He
and I go to the Cheesecake Factory and catch up and have coffee (there
was a truckload to catch up on)! We go home, surf the web for a while
and then go to&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are following, the next day was Wednesday. This is when I
get to see my brother Shane, who goes to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCI&lt;/span&gt;. He has class at weird
times but we hang out around this. When he is in class or rehearsal, I
go to cafes and work. Then he and his friend Rachel (iknoeright?!) and I
hang out and go to the Jacuzzi. We go back to his apartment and watch
Bollywood Music Videos on YouTube. I then sleep on a mat on his&amp;nbsp;floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday, he and I hang out more and then I get to see my first show of
his since he started College. It was the one Professor choreographed
show of the year. My God! It was spectacular. I have seen a lot of dance
shows and musicals in my time and this was some professional quality
stuff! Dancers could only be in two of the dances max. The first one
Shane was in was called &amp;#8220;Artifacts Suite&amp;#8221; and was a really superior
piece. My favorite part I can only describe as a spider-movement chorus
line! The other one he was in was inspired by Van Gogh&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Starry Night.&amp;#8221;
The Dancing Van Gogh was a little hokey, but I still more or less liked
it. I really enjoyed some of the other dances (including the one my
father dubbed the Lesbian workout), but I don&amp;#8217;t have time to go into
that&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show got out at 11 pm. I said goodbye to Shane, picked up Andrew,
and drove to the Valley to crash at his place. For tomorrow was the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8230;It was a dark and stormy night. No&amp;nbsp;foolin&amp;#8217;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, Andrew and I went to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IHOP&lt;/span&gt; with Mowi and Twin, where someone was
going to eat someone&amp;#8217;s meat ;). Then we did some last minute shopping
and got over to Malibu Creek State Park. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt; is a continuation of
Ye&amp;#8217; Olde D&amp;amp;D Campaign. So I got to play &lt;strong&gt;Razza&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;nbsp;w00t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except that logistically the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt; was a complete catastrophe. It was
rainy and disgusting. Within 3 hours I was completely drenched and mud
had soaked through my shoes and socks and reached my feet. If this had
been a normal camping expedition and I had been running it, I would have
called it off. If this had been a normal camping expedition and I was
simply going on it, I probably would have wimped out on account of all
of my gear being in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUSTIN&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I ended up doing was running out to Sports Chalet, buying
waterproof boots and a $2 flashlight and sleeping in my parents car
(which they had loaned me). This compromise prooved mostly acceptable. I
was still wet during the day, wet and cold at night, but at least I was
dry and warm while I was trying to&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, the game itself (while in character) was a
blast! I loved playing Razza and Undead Flunkie #2 (infinite respawns!).
Hanging out with Rob was super fun both in out of character. Seriously
one of the better RPers and cooler people I have met in a really, really
long time. It is known. Mowi made an awesome Phoenix, though Siyona did
not come out so she and Razza did not get to meet again&amp;nbsp;=/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, being Undead Flunkie #2 with infinite respawns (of 2)
underscored the fact that all of the other people who were supposed to
play NPCs bailed. Which was lame. Four people on plot and two NPCs for
30 something PCs. We were way understaffed. Additionally, I only saw Kai
and Rachel at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt; for like 5 minutes. Rachel got sick and had to go
to the hospital, so I guess this is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;. Hopefully I will be able to see
them next&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/LARP#"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt; pictures are&amp;nbsp;here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, after the game, I went to the After Game Party! Andrew and I
then left to go back to Irvine. I had to get there to return the car to
my parents who had just gotten out of Shane&amp;#8217;s show. My whole immediate
family and Shane&amp;#8217;s Rachel then went to dinner. I said good bye and then
had them drop me off at the Irvine Spectrum Center (a big mall with a
Ferris wheel and a lot of Middle Earth references). This is where I met
Shawn for a couple of hours. We walked around and then Andrew joined us.
I bought a duffel bag and then we got tea. It was really good to see&amp;nbsp;Shawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew and I went home, I found out my paper has been accepted for
publication, we had buttery nipples and peanut butter cup liquor shots
and surfed the web. After such a long day we&amp;nbsp;crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday morning I caught a Taxi to the airport and flew back to Austin!
Anthony and Robin and I went to a wine bar and drank and ate cheese. A
fitting end to a great&amp;nbsp;escape!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to being everywhere always; I also had to do a fair amount

ever had. It was lame. And then there are the logistics of how I am
going to get the car back to my folks. It is just&amp;nbsp;nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways I am off to see Shane perform for the first time since he
entered college. Should be good. I am&amp;nbsp;excited.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, I went to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://larryedmunds.com/"&gt;Larry Edmunds Bookshop&lt;/a&gt; to pick up some more stills. I have been
planning this for months. It didn&amp;#8217;t quite work though, since the list of
names I brought in was not what they had available. This didn&amp;#8217;t stop me
from buying anything though ~_~. We just had to be creative with what
we looked&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I restrained myself and *only* purchased one &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.colleenmoore.org/"&gt;Colleen Moore&lt;/a&gt; still.
She is dressed in traditional Spanish/Mexican garb. It is
hilarious/awesome. All of their Seven Samurai folder was cleared out and
so I could not get a picture of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0875477/"&gt;Keiko Tsushima&lt;/a&gt; (who plays the
sexually active girl in Seven Samurai). Also their folder&amp;#8217;s for &amp;#8220;Nights
of Cabiria&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;la Strada&amp;#8221; were empty. So the picking for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulietta_Masina"&gt;Guilietta
Masina&lt;/a&gt; were very slim. But I did manage to get a few decent ones.
Specifically, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm2320209920/tt0050783"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And randomly I found a poster for &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019800/"&gt;Dangerous Curves&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; featuring
Clara Bow. It screamed out &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t You Want Me?!&amp;#8221; So I bought&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More or less peeps all up and down the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; coast agree it is time. If you
don&amp;#8217;t know what I am talking about, that is ok&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a totally unrelated note, at least three people know what Super
Secret Project 2&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days are filled with driving and seeing friends for like 2-4 hours
and then moving on to the next bunch. As whirlwind as it is, I love them
all and wouldn&amp;#8217;t trade this vacation for the world. Even though it is
crazy I am still managing to&amp;nbsp;recharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular interest is that I am so euphoric about the experience, I
don&amp;#8217;t find moving from one social structure to the next the least bit
jarring. Maybe it is all the pent up emotion and ways to communicate and
knowing that I have to express myself &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt; or it simply won&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only evidence to this end is that my body doesn&amp;#8217;t want to wake up
(which only happens when I am sad) and I am playing video games again
(which I use as escapism). And that there is nothing that I have control
over that I have any damn right to be sad&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, after I failed my quals the first time out I spent way too
much time on Disgaea, and then a shamefully long amount of time of Elder
Scrolls &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt;: Oblivion after that. Not that I am anywhere near that
commitment on Civilization Revolutions yet, but&amp;nbsp;stirll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to work; I basically wanna get on a plane and fly away. And
sleep. Man I need to kick this. I have a ton of stuff to do. Luckily my
debugging went well today because 5 months ago I had the good sense to
write readable code. Unlike 9 months&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is that. Probably part of it is this conversation Shawn and I
had about girls last night. He has a more scattershotgun approach than I
do. Thus his advice sort of runs counter to the conventional wisdom that
Kerry Prime gives me (and others). In fact their seem to be two&amp;nbsp;camps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The peeps who have known me since high school (with whom I tend to&amp;nbsp;agree)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the folks who I have met afterwards, who generally encourage a
broader choice&amp;nbsp;range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know. I am sick of thinking about this. And I am tired. And all
I wanna do is play Civ and sleep and get my PhD. And &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VACATION&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/endrawr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least I am having fun ranting on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.heradvocate.org/"&gt;otherblog&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You proved us naysayers among you that this is not the 1960s or 1970s.
This is not Israel. All it takes is one crazy person who wants to force
their will on the rest of us. But here and now, that crazy person has
enough respect for democracy not to go out a-ssainatin&amp;#8217;. I think this
makes me happier to be an American than anything&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But life and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://podcasts.thestranger.com/savagelove/#045356"&gt;Savage Lovecast&lt;/a&gt; tromp on (first minute+). I have a
ton of ideas in my mind that have been building up but did not get
published because of quals. I am sure you will see at least some of
those forthcoming. But for now, I have a couple of awesome things to
show you that I have&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Twitter on Website`_:&lt;/strong&gt; My latest Tweet now shows up in my status bar
(on the left) of my website. Easy little hack I thought up. Took me
about an hour to implement. But it is fun and makes everything so much
more&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DYNAMIC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Other Blog`_:&lt;/strong&gt; As some of you may or may not have known, about a
year ago I started an environmental blog over on blogger. The idea was
to keep LiveJournal as a personal space and Blogger as a professional
one. Thus was born &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.heradvocate.org"&gt;HerAdvocate.Org&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;Which I promptly became too overwhelmed and too under-motivated to
update regularly. However, with the passing of my quals and the
realization that I might have to get a real job in a year, online
advocating is back! I promise this time to rant at least once a week on
it. In fact, if I am posting here and not there, poke me. Hard. With an&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICBM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is what I want you, my readership, to do please. Basically if
you Google Reader or some other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed, go to the blog and add it to
your feed. That way you don&amp;#8217;t have to remember another website to go to
and I get people who are actually reading the thing. (I find it hard to
right without and audience in mind). If you don&amp;#8217;t have an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; Reader,
you really should get one. And add HerAdvocate to it. Also, I won&amp;#8217;t copy
the content from there over here. So if you wanna fanboygirl me out, you
will need to go there too. Additionally, if you have any friends or
relations who you might think would be interested in reading it, please
also let them know. Thanks a ton in&amp;nbsp;advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; that is&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;

Also
I feel the need to post in my tired, and post-barhopping state. So I
apologize for spelling and grammatical&amp;nbsp;errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the situation is all to surreal to feel right now. In some
way the success of me passing (a good thing) yields a predictable path
that my life will take for the however many years. However, if I had
failed (bad), then my life may have taken a more interesting and
unexpected turn here in a few&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, failing would have called into very question the nature of any and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of my academic pursuits. It would have meant admitting that, once
again, other people are unfathomably smarter than me. And rather than
dealing with them, I would have likely ran away again. Shit is getting
real in Austin anyways and it is time to step up or ship out. But back
to the main&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing my quals, in some very large sense, while opening up the option
to continue on with my PhD here, closed off the multitude of other
options that are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANYTHING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELSE&lt;/span&gt; I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COULD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAVE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DONE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WITH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIFE&lt;/span&gt;.
Maybe this is being over-reaching, but on some level I find this kind of&amp;nbsp;sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in August I promised to give this second round of testing it&amp;#8217;s fair
shot. Which I think I did. My mom took this to mean that I had basically
given up. But really, I think it meant that either way I would have been
satisfied with the results, knowing I had given it all I could
reasonably give it. I was prepared to be content with the&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, more than anything, I am&amp;nbsp;tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong. It isn&amp;#8217;t that I am not happy, it isn&amp;#8217;t that I am
not exciting, it isn&amp;#8217;t that I am not elated that I am &lt;em&gt;actually going to
get my doctorate&lt;/em&gt;! But truthfully, it didn&amp;#8217;t really hit me until I
talked to my parental unit. My mom was thrilled since I will be the
first one in her line to get a doctorate (though not to become a
professor). My dad called me from India to wish me congratulations. My
grandmother used three contiguous exclamation points in an email she
sent me!!! Maybe this was worth&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I am thrilled that my life will finally be unpaused. There are
all these little details I can now worry about again. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; I can forget
about all of the big details I can do nothing to change. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt; was the
&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; success of the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, it takes a village to get through this sort of
thing. I would like to thank every member of the tribe (local &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; virtual)
that helped me get through this trying time. I know the past 5 months
have been no easier on you than on me. In any even thank you all for
your support, especially considering the lack of a sole personage
dedicated to the task. You did&amp;nbsp;great!&lt;/p&gt;

This
instill a bit of confidence, though I am wary of hubris and am still
studying my brains out. Which is why I am going a bit loopy. Three days
left. Two days of studying. I am&amp;nbsp;wreck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatevs. Since it has been in the news a lot lately, I thought I would
put in my two shekels about Hamas (not strictly the Palestinians) and&amp;nbsp;Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is a lot of misunderstanding out there about what is going
on and why. One of the major ones is that somehow Israel and the
Israelis don&amp;#8217;t care about the Palestinians or the Palestinian people.
And by extension, American Jewry feels the same. This is quite ignorant
of the Israeli peace movement and slaps the faces of the conscientious
objectors in Israel. The situation is much more complicated. On both
sides the argument there are extremist and peace movements. And sadly as
time goes on, both sides seem to radicalize further. All it takes to
destroy the hope for peace on either side is one rocket or one suicide&amp;nbsp;bomber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the western world refuses to acknowledge that the present
situation directly derives from *their* flawed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; and post-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt;.
Analogy between the situation in India/Pakistan is apt for what happened
in Israel/Palestine. But that is too huge of a post to go&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, there are two main objections to the current engagement, both
of which I empathize with: 1) the use of White Phosphorous and 2) the
disproportionality of&amp;nbsp;casualties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) So for most of yesterday the media was all a-buzz with the fact that
Israel was using chemical weapons. If true, then yes the commanders who
ordered it and everyone else &amp;#8216;in the know&amp;#8217; should have to answer to an
international war crimes tribunal. However, this was debunked more or
less by the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j2vQ8GynRSG8lBEQir4RtXL9Ib2AD95MLHHG0"&gt;Red Cross&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) This gets into the motivation for the war. The argument goes that the
Israelis have Hamas (not the Palestinians, remember) so outgunned that
the 900+ total civilian and soldier deaths is not fair to the ~20
Israeli deaths thus far. Implying that having more Israeli dead would
somehow legitimize everything. Ummm&amp;nbsp;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we a-go stone castin&amp;#8217;, let&amp;#8217;s look &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/casualties.html"&gt;historically&lt;/a&gt;. The
Israelis have always had very low death rates in their engagements
relative to the size of the forces they went against. I would argue that
this is the only reason the state continues to exist today. The current
numbers are not inconsistent. For rounding sake, let&amp;#8217;s say this current
war is at a ratio of about&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s do the numbers for America, shall we. There were approximately
3000 people who died as a result of 9/11. Iraq has had a Coalition
forces death toll of around 4000. Afghanistan has a number that is close
to 1000. So roughly as a result of one terror attack, we have 8000 dead.
Iraq alone has somewhere between &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.iraqbodycount.org/"&gt;100,000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://antiwar.com/updates/"&gt;1 million+&lt;/a&gt; dead. This
puts our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; ratio at &amp;lt;10 - 100+! Voting for Obama doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that
these Iraqis didn&amp;#8217;t die in your name or&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;unfairly&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess what I am trying to say is that the situation is a lot harder to
piece apart and understand than who shot a rocket at who, or who blew up
whose house. And if you think that the western world has any credibility
in the matter think again. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; maybe more so than others, but we were
just as fooled by Arafat as anyone else. And that is only as long as we
don&amp;#8217;t judge others harsher than we judge ourselves (ie why we sat out of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s condemnation last&amp;nbsp;week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace should be pursued for peace&amp;#8217;s own&amp;nbsp;sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Also, food for thought, why do left-leaning in this country people
support Hamas over the Israelis, yet not the Tamil Tigers of Eelam over
the Sri&amp;nbsp;Lankans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Also, I am a believer in Land-for-Peace and a Two State solution.
Hopefully within my lifetime or sooner. I do not deny the Palestinians
their&amp;nbsp;sovereignty.&lt;/p&gt;

lot of music. So much so that I got bored with my own ample&amp;nbsp;collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I have known about &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pandora.com/"&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt; for a while now, only in the past
week have I started listening to it with any frequency. It is really
great for those genres where there are a lot of artists who do a couple
of songs each that are really&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the Doo-Wop &amp;#8216;station&amp;#8217; is wonderful. As is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eurodancehits.com/erotic.html"&gt;E-Rotic&lt;/a&gt; one I
made, which more or less plays a lot of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, through Pandora
and some side research, I have made two awesome&amp;nbsp;discoveries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Dr. Octagonecologyst`_:&lt;/strong&gt; This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWESOME&lt;/span&gt; pun is an album and stage
name of Kool Keith. It apparently helped define Trip Hop. I am very
tempted to buy this one. I think he is coming to Austin in a few
months&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="first"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Elis Regina`_:&lt;/strong&gt; Just when I was about to take it down, it looks
like I have another name to add to the &lt;strong&gt;`&amp;#8221;Dead Women I&amp;#8217;d Bang&amp;#8221;`_&lt;/strong&gt;
list! This talented and gorgeous Brazilian singer from the &amp;#8216;60s -
&amp;#8216;80s recorded a version of &lt;em&gt;`&amp;#8221;Aguas de Marco&amp;#8221;`_&lt;/em&gt; that is still hailed
as the best selling Brazilian track of all&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is so popular, in fact, that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lifehacker.com/399156/how-covervilles-brian-ibbott-gets-things-done"&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; should do a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.coverville.com/"&gt;Coverville&lt;/a&gt;
of it. I have actually been a fan of &amp;#8220;Aguas de Marco&amp;#8221; for a while now
without knowing it. I first heard it through the percussion group
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.uakti.com.br/"&gt;Uakti&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Aguas de Marco&amp;#8221; is the first song of theirs on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.samurai.fm/play.ram?id=2362&amp;amp;t=6&amp;amp;p=15"&gt;this
sample stream&lt;/a&gt;. The acclaimed Elis Regina version is found below. It
is hard to say which version I like&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still haven&amp;#8217;t found a singer in Occitan to steal my heart.&amp;nbsp;Suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;

In Austin. She got on an
airplane and flew out of here. No, she did not leave abandon me in some
foreign airport to fend for myself. Picking pennies out of fountains to
purchase over-priced cinnamon rolls. Nope. Not this time,&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a fairly important milestone. It marks the end of the &amp;#8220;Robin
+ Anthony = Wedding&amp;#8221; for me. It also marks the End of Fun, wherein I
must remain devoutly studious*, until my qualifying exam (which is on
Friday January 16th). No working on projects. No hanging out with
friends. Preferably, no or limited chatting online. Forced
&amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221;-person schedule. Basically, all I am allowing myself to do is
sleep, eat, workout, housework, wind-down, and&amp;nbsp;study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, I might now have 15 minutes to myself for the first
time in two to three weeks. I need to relax and recover from everything.
But Wait! This is my life, so No! I think even Robin and Anthony have
gotten a couple of days or somewhat regular behavior. However, I
*have* to dive right into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIFE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DATE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The qualifiers will literally make or break me; they will decide whether
the decision to come to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UT&lt;/span&gt; was right or a near complete waste of time
out of which I may(?) be able to scrounge a masters that I can apply for
a couple of years before I hit the ceiling of its&amp;nbsp;usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In typical Michael/Scopatz** fashion, the ridiculous timing of such
important life events is fully outside of my realm of control. Stupid
Life operator acting on the eigenvector of Me. At least the heart attack
of the quals being on Monday is over. When the world throws you a
curveball, it tends to break the blender you were making tasty and
refreshing lemonade&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, take this as notice that I&amp;#8217;m gonna zip into Introvert
mode for about a week. More or less, since I won&amp;#8217;t have time to maintain
my emotional state, having me think about yours is nearly totally out of
the&amp;nbsp;question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Seeya on the Flip Side!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Wish Me Luck!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Note: I have been studying basically everyday since November for
this. I even managed to squeeze in 6-8 hours a day while my mother was
here, post-nuptials. So what I mean here is more like 8-14 hours a day.
Hell, I like neutrons, but I didn&amp;#8217;t wanna marry them. I need a real fake&amp;nbsp;woman!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt; Note: Michael/Scopatz has nothing to do with anyone other than
my Family. Micheal is my mother&amp;#8217;s maiden and my middle name. I use this
term as a convolution of those two parental aspects within myself. It
seems this went&amp;nbsp;misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Maybe&amp;nbsp;Not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So New Years Eve was fun. But then again, it was terrible. A couple of
seeds that were planted in 2008 came to fruition and I am not entirely
pleased with the yield. Still, I am enough of an academic to appreciate
the results even if they are&amp;nbsp;disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I communicate in a fundamentally deviant way. However, no matter
how often I try to explain to people what (little?) I have been able to
figure out, it still seems like I need training wheels to cope with my
friends and they need training wheels for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than listing resolutions, here are some of my trip-ups that I
hope to learn&amp;nbsp;from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mistakes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extro-/Introvert:&lt;/strong&gt; So apparently everyone under the sun believes
that I am an Extrovert. I thought I made it pretty clear that I flip
between the two based on the taxonomy of those I am around &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; that
largely the Extroverted personality is a mask because &amp;#8220;being
Extroverted is more socially acceptable&amp;#8221; [Keirsey, et al]. Even my
Introverted friends don&amp;#8217;t like it when I am Introverted. Isn&amp;#8217;t this
incentive to not be &amp;#8220;who I really am&amp;#8221; [whatever that&amp;nbsp;means]?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Trolling:`_&lt;/strong&gt; There are clearly major modal communication
differences between myself and my friends. The most common way that
these manifest is through the use of Trolling. Just because many
people in a group wish to use this method of communication doesn&amp;#8217;t
imply that it isn&amp;#8217;t something I am not sensitive to nor that I enjoy
it. On the one hand, I am willing to meet people halfway and
compromise. On the other hand, If I tell people that they have
crossed the line a dozen times and they refuse to alter their
behavior it shows me that they don&amp;#8217;t really value me as a&amp;nbsp;friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blake:&lt;/strong&gt; I am so sorry and I did deserve the troll. Even if you
weren&amp;#8217;t offended, I still find my own behavior abhorrent. Not that
you can read this because the post is&amp;nbsp;locked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Contract:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it has now been shown, twice and
painfully, that the relationship contract that currently exists for
my friends needs errata. Once again I am eager to meet everyone
halfway. I want &lt;em&gt;constructive, active, descriptive feedback&lt;/em&gt; on my
life and for my friends to challenge and watch out for me. (I
understand that this may be confusing since there are certainly
things I won&amp;#8217;t talk about, but other than those topics everything is
fair game.) And also, I absolutely 100% require Respect in
Friendship. No respect is clear grounds for termination. But what do
you want? For me not to generate drama? I am fine with that; I don&amp;#8217;t
like drama and try to minimize it. But is drama &amp;#8216;over(?)analyzing&amp;#8217;
things? I don&amp;#8217;t have a concept of limits here. Please&amp;nbsp;help!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperado:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#8217;t want to be drunk and be taken advantage of.
Yes, I did give my consent, but I was rather inebriated and tried
saying &amp;#8220;No&amp;#8221; for like an hour (in drunk-time). I was under the
impression that my friends would step up and stop me from doing
something drunk that I would regret. Unfortunately, because of
&lt;strong&gt;{Social Contract}&lt;/strong&gt; and the fact that *some* friends could not
stand, let alone step anywhere, intervention did not occur. It was
slutty in all of the bad ways and none of the good. (And before
anyone from Live Oak says it,&amp;nbsp;Dion++)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize that these are all my problems. And like Dan Savage says, I am
the lowest common denominator in all of them. But this is why I am slow:
I have identified what I need to change, but the option-space of what to
change into is So &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARGE&lt;/span&gt; that without your help I won&amp;#8217;t ever be able to
narrow it down to a few reasonable&amp;nbsp;choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRAH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRAH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRAH&lt;/span&gt; Angry at self and others! How many times can my
self-image be shattered in a day and for me to still remain sane? I
think I need some sort of stabilizing drugs. Maybe I should self
medicate.&amp;nbsp;Booze.&lt;/p&gt;

Melody and I were both playing a very weak Devil&amp;#8217;s advocate half of the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less, what I don&amp;#8217;t understand is why people (hard atheists, etc)
bag on Religion (as a concept) because specific religions in specific
times do harm and negatively influence people, where on the other hand
they give Science and/or Law and/or Medicine and other &amp;#8220;rational&amp;#8221;
pursuits of&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called logical studies have been and will continue to be just as
much if not vastly more so tool of discrimination and hate and racism as
Religion ever has. I could sum this point in one word: Nazis. But really
there is so much more to the subjects of Nuclear, Chemical, Biological,
Mechanical Weapons, Jim Crow Laws, and Medical abuse and malpractice
that it isn&amp;#8217;t worth filling up this space entirely. Oh and then there is
that whole military industrial complex thing that we invented, whose
express purpose is of death and yet produced almost every innovation in
our kitchen&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My basic point is that I think Religion is unjustly bashed. Not that it
doesn&amp;#8217;t sometimes deserve it. But it isn&amp;#8217;t as if the Pope speaks for all
faiths&amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on another level I get that some (few?) people have had their lives
negatively impacted by people whose minds have turned to hate and who
use their faith as a justification. This is especially painful with
family members. Which is what I am guessing leads some to denounce All
Religions as hateful and&amp;nbsp;irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still I struggle. Isn&amp;#8217;t it the people that are being hateful and
irrational? And isn&amp;#8217;t Science and Logic, which are trumped for their
superiority, used hatefully just as or more often on a gross scale than&amp;nbsp;Religion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, there is no excuse for Hate. Only intolerant of Intolerance,
right? I don&amp;#8217;t know; You decide! Maybe someone out there has some gem of
wisdom that my Yiddishe tuchas has&amp;nbsp;missed.&lt;/p&gt;

long while, I read &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hatrack.com/osc/books/treason.shtml"&gt;Treason&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hatrack.com/osc/about.shtml"&gt;Orson Scott Card&lt;/a&gt; a couple of
days ago. A noteworthy event, believe you&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As his second novel (revised version, like with &amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234726.Hot_Sleep_The_Worthing_Chronicle"&gt;Hot Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;) it is
in some ways quite raw. The first third of the book was essentially
transsexual erotic fiction. So if that was the bait, consider me hooked.
I somehow don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story was told from a first person future perspective. This was
probably the novel&amp;#8217;s biggest fault. This perspective naturally leads you
to piece together plot points that the reader has yet to see. Thus,
outside of aspects of the universe that you haven&amp;#8217;t yet been introduced
to, there is no way to surprise the&amp;nbsp;reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Card, his strength lies in the ability to create detailed
and interesting worlds to explore. So even though our hero Lanik Mueller
never did anything that he hadn&amp;#8217;t previously hinted that he would do,
his wanderings are still rather interesting. In some sense, he has a
very Odysseus-eque travel. On this universe-centered story telling,
&amp;#8220;Treason&amp;#8221; is most similar to his other works &amp;#8220;Hot Sleep&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Wyrms&amp;#8221; and
&amp;#8220;Hart&amp;#8217;s Hope&amp;#8221;. All four tend to decentralize the importance of the
characters and see them more as eventual and necessary arrivals on the
stage of the great time-dependent differential equation of their
respective worlds. Lanik Mueller isn&amp;#8217;t important, but someone like him&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for us Lanik Meuller seems to operate with the our modern
day moral structure and not his own. This is a consistency with Card
though. The genius of Heinlein is that he creates elaborate places that
have their own detailed and intense corresponding ethical structure. And
even while doing so, he denies the existence of absolute moral
relativism (see &amp;#8220;Farnham&amp;#8217;s Freehold&amp;#8221;). The genius of Asimov is that he
was able to single-handedly define and expand the morality of robots and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;. The genius of Bradbury is to point out those human universalities
that exist regardless of technology level. From all of the Card I have
read (which is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;) he never seems to care about these&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign aspects of his works are in the science/magic alone, and the
similarities lie in that his characters act as if they were to pinnacle
of modern personality types. Perhaps his books have a broader appeal
because there is some cold, familiar comfort in this setup. However, in
retrospect, I am tempted to think it is somewhat of a cop&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe he isn&amp;#8217;t good at mixing up moral frames of reference so he steers
away from it in general. Which is fine. But this gets back to my main
criticism that the main characters are more static than my bar of
interest would normally allow. Luckily, his early works tended to be
short, not giving time for his characters to do much other than explore
the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, I liked it. I couldn&amp;#8217;t put it down. But whether this was
because I was fascinated with his uncomfortable writing of transsexual,
lesbian, and gay sexuality or whether I liked the world is hard to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;

at Love&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. Much to my academic&amp;nbsp;disgrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show is basically a dating &amp;#8216;reality&amp;#8217; show with twin bisexual women
as the love object. Separately of course. We still believe in strict
monogamy on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MTV&lt;/span&gt; apparently. And that right there is what makes this show&amp;nbsp;amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is this carefully cultivated sense on the program that taboos are
breaking like a monster truck on thin ice. However, anything even
slightly non-whitebread is squashed rather quickly. Let&amp;#8217;s look shall&amp;nbsp;we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They kicked off &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10568"&gt;Claudia&lt;/a&gt;, the Dominatrix, in first&amp;nbsp;episode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most wave-shot Surfer dude, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10565"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;, is the one both the *ikki
twins agree&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of the twelve women competitors only two were even vaguely&amp;nbsp;butch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first was &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10567"&gt;Bella&lt;/a&gt; who was let go in the first episode because
she has tattoos&amp;nbsp;:gasp:!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10574"&gt;Nicky&lt;/a&gt;, was kicked off in the third episode because the
twins trapped her into saying that maybe sometimes she has thought
life would be easier if she had a penis. On some level isn&amp;#8217;t that
just restating what feminists and equalists say about female
inequality in this&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stereotypical frat boy &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10564"&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt;, who is operating under some
head-based hanky code, is still on the&amp;nbsp;show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luckily, east coast elitists like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10571"&gt;Jen&lt;/a&gt; are eventually also weeded
out by the non-plastic people&amp;nbsp;clause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10553"&gt;Coop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/a_double_shot_at_love/cast_member/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=10552"&gt;Ben&lt;/a&gt;, token Black and Jew, are gone in episode&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so the *ikki twins have fairly narrow vision in terms types.
They are bisexual but also bimodal: Straight Boys or
Fem-to-the-point-of-passing-as-Straight Lesbians. And the show relies on
base tropes for its &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkX8Q3iq-gw&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;humor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, maybe there is something to be said for just having a
show about twin bisexual women on television. I am not saying that it is
revolutionary, but it is not without social context either (sort of like
Willow on Buffy). Let&amp;#8217;s face it. 50 years ago you couldn&amp;#8217;t have had a
show about homosexuals on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;. 25 years ago you couldn&amp;#8217;t have a show
about lesbians or gays. 10 years ago you couldn&amp;#8217;t have had a show about
bisexuals on&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe we are progressing. Maybe we are going somewhere. Maybe we are
liberating&amp;nbsp;ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then again, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-anti-gay-violence,1,455717.story"&gt;maybe not&lt;/a&gt;. Oh Mein Papa, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/Gay-groups-attack-Pope.4821155.jp"&gt;you are not helping&lt;/a&gt;. (On
the plus side the Google query &amp;#8220;Gay Pope&amp;#8221; now returns valid&amp;nbsp;hits.)&lt;/p&gt;

Dykes to Watch Out For&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTWOF&lt;/span&gt;) by Alison&amp;nbsp;Bechdel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child (9ish-12ish) I distinctly remember reader my mother&amp;#8217;s copy of
a previous compilation. I recalled it being interesting but more or less
a Lesbian soap opera. Which it is. Now don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, I grew up
watching soap operas. I like them, especially the ones with a more
comedic bent. Which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTWOF&lt;/span&gt; also is. [As an aside my favor with soaps
probably stems from the same neurons that enjoy epic stories with long
complicated&amp;nbsp;plots].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is more than a Lesbian Soap! It certainly functions on that
level, but as a kid I totally missed all of the commentary and debate
that goes on. Ms Bechdel certainly has her own beliefs that come
through. But through all of the various characters a lot of opinions get
expressed about every subject with relative objectivity. Like in real
life, nothing is ever &amp;#8216;solved&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;decided&amp;#8217;. But while reading it I kept
thinking, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve had this conversation! I have had this argument! I have
felt this&amp;nbsp;way.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the comic has been written every couple of weeks since 1987, each
strip is deeply entrenched in its own temporalness. It is beautifully
morose document of American/Lesbian political culture from the initial
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; crisis through the disillusioned Clinton years onto 9/11 and the
following and ongoing two wars. There is that old &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/guide/602/"&gt;South Park joke&lt;/a&gt;
about how Cancer is now the sympathy disease, making &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; funny. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTWOF&lt;/span&gt;
emotionally doubles down and covers both with pure seriousness. In light
of our more irreverent demons, this is&amp;nbsp;impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before I go any further, I want to make sure that you understand
that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTWOF&lt;/span&gt; is very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; funny. Seeing the old hat Lesbians tackle
with the conservative republican Lesbian is a hoot. Not to mention the
Jewish man who is more of a dyke than his bisexual girlfriend. But a
significant portion of the humor is well-placed background puns and
opportune Shakespeare and Talking Heads quotes. Repeating them wouldn&amp;#8217;t
do them&amp;nbsp;justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance it is tempting to say that the main character Mo is the
author mies-en-scene. This might even be to first approximation true.
However, after learning something about Ms Bechdel herself, the
comparison seems less meaningful. Yes, Mo may have stepped out of Good
Ole Alison&amp;#8217;s shoes. However, she took of running to different 5k&amp;nbsp;marks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to another point about the naming schema used. I know
about the Law of Conservation of Names. Mo&amp;#8217;s girlfriend was named
Sydney; eerie&amp;#8230; Bisexual-stealing boyfriend named Stuart, anyone? How
about one of the main character&amp;#8217;s being named Toni (Lord help you if you
know anyone by *that* name&amp;nbsp;though!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mo was very identifiable. At least to me. Maybe &amp;#8216;Our Heroine&amp;#8217; was meant
to be that way, but there was just too much to ignore safely. Smart, but
not quite the intellectual cut, plagued by the worlds problems there
isn&amp;#8217;t much she can do about, goes through long celibate streaks, cuts
friends off when they lose her trust, Democracy Now obsessed, basically
monogamous as a risk prevention strategy, likes girls with boy cuts and
fetishes, and values her privacy. Yes, our heroine rings many bells. But
then again, maybe I am&amp;nbsp;projecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTWOF&lt;/span&gt; provoked me to think; never a bad state of&amp;nbsp;affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time when we were developing &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scopatz.com/projects/okc/"&gt;the Mark profile&lt;/a&gt; that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://leximancer.livejournal.com/"&gt;leximancer&lt;/a&gt; said something like &amp;#8220;There is nothing that makes Mark gay.
&lt;strong&gt;He just fucks boys.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; He was right and we fixed it. But still it took
me back. That same concept, that being a Lesbian nowadays is a different
thing than being biological female and having a strong gender sexuality
preference to other females, is repeated and struggled with by the
different characters throughout&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTWOF&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this brings us to an important point in our
Straight-Until-Proven-Otherwise culture. The analogous contra positive
is that maybe, just maybe, you be a guy who fucks girls or a girl who
fucks guys without being straight. Maybe you can fuck both girls and
guys with impunity without being Bisexual. You don&amp;#8217;t have to buy into
the culture identity that surrounds the gender&amp;nbsp;preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it has been said (by ex-patriot Idahoans) that I am their gayest
friend in Austin. I certainly wouldn&amp;#8217;t deny it. But not because I
associate with the with Gay or Straight culture. If anything I associate
with Lesbian culture (but you&amp;#8217;d have to know my mother to understand
that&amp;nbsp;one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lois in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTWOF&lt;/span&gt;, upon finding out that Stuart has a habit of dating women
who then turn out to be Lesbians says, &amp;#8220;Jeeze, what is with those guys?&amp;#8221;
I wish I freaking&amp;nbsp;knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duly prompted, I am renouncing the &amp;#8220;Straight&amp;#8221; tag. I don&amp;#8217;t think it
really describes me. I am now (and likely have always been) the
quainter, more direct &amp;#8220;boy who fucks girls&amp;#8221;. I think that there are
enough criticisms out there of Straight (and Male) culture in the milieu
that I need not provide&amp;nbsp;examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am crazy (You Decide?), but I think this makes sense. I dropped

lot better. And who knows, maybe it will even help me find a meaningful
relationship again. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jeffreygoldberg.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/12/tanehisi_coates.php"&gt;And maybe she&amp;#8217;ll even be Jewish.&lt;/a&gt; And then we

That&amp;#8217;s right, we&amp;#8217;ll open a joint checking account&amp;nbsp;(0xDTWOF#7)!&lt;/p&gt;

First time since undergrad that I was
drinking from Thursday until Sunday. Nothing binge-worthy; just a drink
or two each night. But the best part was the spontaneity of it. I was
planning on getting work done!&amp;nbsp;Pshaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony came in from Houston, so I hung out with him and others on Thursday
and&amp;nbsp;Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday and Sunday were dominated by Super Secret Project &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scopatz.com/2/"&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; and a
Nuclear program Holiday Party. Thankfully I wasn&amp;#8217;t inebriated at the
Holiday&amp;nbsp;Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the density of fun was intense! I haven&amp;#8217;t gone from Basketball to
Karaoke in four hours in a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the weekend was not without its likely&amp;nbsp;mistakes&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hate to break it to you, but some things in science are governed by
consensus, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change"&gt;Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the consensus online is that, in fact, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080319184222AAhKDJY"&gt;cats do
have&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;amp;address=105x1338294"&gt;free will&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a subject we failed to touch on is that cats act as an operator that
removes free will from&amp;nbsp;humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you wanted to know the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.aish.com/shmooze/animals_dont_have_free_will.asp"&gt;Jewish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/"&gt;Philosophical&lt;/a&gt;
answers. Which I am apt to agree with in fact (That pets don&amp;#8217;t have free
will as such because they don&amp;#8217;t have the moral&amp;nbsp;capacity.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all sources agree that higher order animals (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.asofterworld.com/oq-display.php?id=58"&gt;like cats&lt;/a&gt;) have
the capacity to make decisions (just not moral ones). Moreover, cats,
dogs, apes, monkeys, dolphins, rodents, ocelots, etc. certainly have an
emotional capacity. [They&amp;#8217;d be pretty terrible pets if they&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#8217;t.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, maybe they don&amp;#8217;t have Free Will as such, but I would feel pretty
terrible about imprisoning a fellow being who has the capacity to make a
choice and feel the consequences of its&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MORAL&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I am too much of a puto to own a pussy-cat here. Maybe I
should move to Los&amp;nbsp;Gatos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MORAL&lt;/span&gt; 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FINE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;~_~.&lt;/p&gt;

I am web 2.0-ing
the hell out of my website. Additionally, I have this cool setup that
lets me remotely mount a directory as a drive (in Windows) and as a
directory on my local system (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;/Linux). This solves my age old problem
of wanting shared space between Windows and Linux. Now, I just put it on
my shared space on my server and no matter what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; or computer I am on,
I can access it! Super cool,&amp;nbsp;huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatevs, youz guyz. I am totally&amp;nbsp;stoked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Mobile Suit Gundam F91 (1991)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; In my quest to watch all of the
Gundams, I skipped right over the Super Deformed series and went
straight to this one. I am ignoring the fact that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; Gundam ever&amp;nbsp;existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;F91 is set about 30 years later than the conclusion of Char-Amuro plot
epic win thread. However, it was intended in production to a full 52
episode series. The fact that they squashed it into two hours blows. Not
that it was bad, but just that they left in all of the predictable parts
of the story and and cut out all of the what would have been different&amp;nbsp;parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the initial conditions were very far off from the norm.
The intro was a normal battle sequence. However, the moment that you
catch a media broadcast that informs you that the perpetrators of the
attack were flying a &amp;#8220;Crossbones Vanguard&amp;#8221; I was hooked. That is right,
we had space pirates! And no Zeon! And a girl as the&amp;nbsp;protagonist!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the Pirates turned out to have nobility and were
destroying some colonies and taking over others to meet their goal of
establishing a civilization free of the earth sphere. And they were
willing to use WMDs to destory 90% of humanity to reach this goal.
Jeeze! These guys are really bad at being&amp;nbsp;Not-Zeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Quantum of Solace (2008)`_:&lt;/strong&gt;I know, I know. This movie is hardly
forgotten. But I want to review it&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming opinion given to me about this movie was apathy. But I
really liked it. The recent Bond films have been progressively breaking
most of the standard Bond tropes, and I really like it. We&amp;#8217;ve seen 007
be &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Another_Day"&gt;tortured&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_Royale_(2006_film)"&gt;fail&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Bond-girl trope be subverted in
this film. &amp;#8220;Quantum of Solace&amp;#8221; does this in two&amp;nbsp;ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Bond himself doesn&amp;#8217;t save the `Bond-girl`_:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, ok. So he does
save her from a burning building. But her whole deal is a vendetta
against the man who killed and raped her family. And she succeeds. The
most James does for her in this is wish her good luck! This is such a
huge role reversal for the standard issue vacuum headed Bond-girl. I was
shocked. And I&amp;nbsp;applauded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Bond has trouble with a
`Bond-girl &amp;lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemma_Arterton&amp;gt;`__:&lt;/strong&gt; In fact,
he gets her killed. Wait what? Bond&amp;#8217;s extreme seduction is dangerous?
That is new. Really New; really cool when you think of it. All more the
pity since she was the only redhead in the film and (I kid you not) her
character name was literally &amp;#8220;Strawberry Fields&amp;#8221;, though she goes only
by &amp;#8220;Fields&amp;#8221; in the&amp;nbsp;movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we are talking about Dead Ms. Fields, we should also talk
about the actress Gemma Arterton. In case you didn&amp;#8217;t know, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3150384/Bond-girl-Gemma-Arterton-was-born-with-six-fingers-on-each-hand.html"&gt;she was born
with six (6) fingers on each hand and a misshapen&amp;nbsp;ear!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six fingers, Each! C&amp;#8217;mon and tell me that isn&amp;#8217;t sexy?! &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2823403.ece"&gt;In Hindustan
they might have worshipped her&lt;/a&gt;. It is so unique. But then to go on to
become a Bond girl, that is just unheard of. Amazing really. This girl
is hot stuff all&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only I could find myself an equally gorgeous &amp;#8220;Penny Lane&amp;#8221;, I think
I&amp;#8217;d be&amp;nbsp;set.&lt;/p&gt;

movie. However I did finish a Gundam mini-series (more on this&amp;nbsp;later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I had an excellent weekend. I even got to hang out with Naole
and Melody and Anthony and Robin for a bit on Friday night. And rather
than being watching them play Halo, I derailed the conversation to being
educated about deviants. This led to my favorite quote of the weekend
which made the comparison between religious rites and orgasms. Sure,
most of them are faked but it is the ones that aren&amp;#8217;t that make all the
trying&amp;nbsp;worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And if you have never heard my thoughts on male orgasms, you are in for
a treat with that&amp;nbsp;conversation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, I almost cried multiple times this weekend. I
almost never almost cry, and even more rarely actually do. So clearly my
emotions were running on high. But the last time is the one you get to
hear&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: A War in the Pocket (1989)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; Right, I
know totally lame to tear up at a Gundam. But let me&amp;nbsp;explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;War in the Pocket&amp;#8221; was the first Gundam not to be directed by Tomino,
and rather than focusing on the Science Fiction aspect of things, it
really is a coming-of-age tale during wartime. It takes place on the
Side 6 Colony (the Switzerland of Space) where both sides are running
covert operations. That is until things get&amp;nbsp;messy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story focuses on a Mobile Suit obsessed 10 yro boy Al who is rather
immature for his age. He takes the first opportunity he can to befriend
Bernie, the Not-A-Char of the series, whose &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; gets shot down near his
house. The obvious conflict ensues when it is revealed that Al&amp;#8217;s next
door neighbor and older-sister-figure Chris is a Federation Forces Pilot
(Allies analogy, to the literal Zeon Axis). Naturally, Chris and Bernie
become the softest of paramours with out them really knowing that they
fight for opposite&amp;nbsp;sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &amp;#8220;War in the Pocket&amp;#8221; really shines in the way it abandons all of
the standard Gundam tropes. In general the pace is a ton slower than you
have come to expect. And sure, Burnie is ridiculously blond, supposed to
be a newtype, occasionally wears sunglasses,and fights for the Zeon, but
that is about where the comparison with Char ends. He never ever in his
backstory or in the series shoots down even a single mobile suit. He is
basically a failure. Also he lies to impress Al, a&amp;nbsp;lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the whole narrative progresses without any main character ever
dying or even getting close, in the grand scheme of things. You come to
expect an ending closer to Miyazaki than Tomino. This makes the ending
especially heartbreaking. They sort of stick the knife into&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then they twist it around a bit. There is a soul crushing moment
where an injured Chris informs Al that she is being transferred back to
Earth. But then she gives him a prolonged kiss on the cheek. The framing
and timing of this scene is perfect and I about lost&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I can compare it to is &amp;#8220;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&amp;#8221; (the
book). The ending was that well done. I really give props to the
director for doing and succeeding at something different. I started off
not liking it at all, but by the end I was fully on board. Right in time
for him to toss me back into the&amp;nbsp;sea!&lt;/p&gt;

I disassembled my main machine and
I am turning it into my server. This should allow my server to be up 99%
of the time rather than the 1% it has&amp;nbsp;been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this mean that I am now functionally without a Main, powerhouse
computer myself. Which implies I will be living off of the school laptop
for a while. Soooo you know what this&amp;nbsp;means&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if I do this right I might be able to satisfy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of my

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is my hilarious server build:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

you over the internet. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;. i am smoking hot, a good dancer, very
attracted to you, and furthermore i&amp;#8217;m from nashville tennessee so we can
have a country-off. or should i say&amp;#8230; a cuntry-off?
i have magical soothsaying abilities, and my inner eye says that i
would probably vacillate between loving and hating you, and i cannot
promise that you would not ever be injured by a bottle of wild turkey to
the head. such is life. my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt; screenname is ~blanked~ - feel free to
talk to me over the internet, because that&amp;#8217;s probably the closest you&amp;#8217;ll
ever get; i sure as hell won&amp;#8217;t drive 500 miles to see anybody i met on
the internet, not even if he had a 10-inch dick and a testicle condition
that required he empty his balls every half hour or die&amp;nbsp;horribly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

place. There was that rare storm on the ocean between the islands and
the coast. The wind was blowing hard. But it was the lightning that was
staggering. Some of it even stayed in the clouds, having their little
disco rave while we watched. Hoping the party would stay over the ocean.
The next day, when the sun shone, the Daily Nexus ran&amp;nbsp;pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what it felt like today when I overheard this whispered&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy:&lt;/strong&gt; So what do you say to them?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing. I don&amp;#8217;t feel that way.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy:&lt;/strong&gt; ~pause~&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, obviously they were G-d&amp;#8217;s chosen people for thousands of years before&amp;#8230;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy:&lt;/strong&gt; But, I mean, don&amp;#8217;t you and your friends still think they are all going to hell or something?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe. But its not like they are total pagans. I don&amp;#8217;t feel the need to go out and to try to convert them like they do.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy:&lt;/strong&gt; But what do you say to your friends then?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl:&lt;/strong&gt; Well I have some Jewish friends, and&amp;#8230;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where I got up and walked away. Only in Texas, mi amigos, only

(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP2&lt;/span&gt;)have made large advances in the past week or so. While &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP&lt;/span&gt; is
leaking out, I think only 4 or 5 people actually know what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP2&lt;/span&gt; is.
Sadly they makametired =/. But onto the&amp;nbsp;Reviews!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`eXistenZ (1999)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; Jeeze, these movies are just getting closer and
closer to now-time. I really liked this film. Half for its head
tripping/world switching wonder and half for Jude Law. Some of the
scenes were quite grotesque, but I liked the movie all the same. I
thought the film was similar in structure to &amp;#8220;Jacob&amp;#8217;s Ladder&amp;#8221; from a few
weeks ago, but others disagreed. In a lot of ways though, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror"&gt;it reminded
me of&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139809/"&gt;&amp;#8220;13th Floor&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***zOMG&amp;nbsp;Spoilers**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is really only one interesting (ie at the end of the film
relevant) thing to talk about: Are they still in the game at the end of
the movie? Unlike most films that fit into this head trope (where the
answer is a definitive, inescapable &amp;#8216;Yes&amp;#8217;) I am inclined to say that
they are no longer in the game as the film ends. The real difference
being that the game, no matter what level it was being played on, always
used the same props and had certain speech patterns and cues that would
draw you out and tell you it wasn&amp;#8217;t real. However these were all gone on
that&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Top-Level&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big give away for me is the guns. They go from bone gun technology
to real guns. It isn&amp;#8217;t surprising that the game took the spin it did
given who our players were and that the game is likely designed to
project and incorporate the subconscious of the&amp;nbsp;players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence against this is that everyone who saw them shoot the game
designers afterward just stared. But even here, I don&amp;#8217;t think this is

My home and native yeast infection! I just got four (4) more
injections. Hopefully this will kill of the last of my warts. I would be
most pleased. Other than that, my body is hatin&amp;#8217; on me in new and
interesting ways. My stomach has been upset since the stupid elections,
but for the past day my ear has had some ridiculous ringing that won&amp;#8217;t
go away.&amp;nbsp;Hrmmm&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto the&amp;nbsp;movie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Char&amp;#8217;s Counter-Attack (1988)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; The definitive end to the first
main Gundam continuity, this edition was beautifully animated. As the
name implies, it followed my second favorite character in the entire
Gundam Universe: Char Aznable. Much like the first series (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSG&lt;/span&gt;), Char is
portrayed as pure evil throughout much of the story. Only towards the
end is it relieved that Char isn&amp;#8217;t trying to destroy Earth per-say by
ramming a giant asteroid into it. He&amp;#8217;s just trying to usher in the next
ice age, which will force humanity to fully migrate to space, and thus
give the planet time to heal from all of the pollution and damage we
have done to it. The eco-terrorist in me was fighting my inner paladin
the whole time. Eco-terrorist wins. Faith in Char&amp;nbsp;restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can guess what &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll"&gt;&amp;#8220;Kill &amp;#8216;Em All&amp;#8221; Tomino&lt;/a&gt; does to both Char and Amuro
by the end. I was kinda glad. They both had survived for far too&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculations on Mr Tomino&amp;#8217;s relationship problems and his
No-Character-Left-Standing nature abound. But I recently noticed
something beyond near every relationship failing, often times
tragically. Nearly all of the male newtypes end up on the &amp;#8220;good-guys&amp;#8221;
side while most of the female ones end up or are manufactured on the
&amp;#8220;bad-guys&amp;#8221; side. Furthermore, if it comes down to a male vs female
newtype battle, the women almost always die instead of the men (there
are notable exceptions). Maybe Tomino just hates on the&amp;nbsp;ladies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it was a very good movie. Some interesting stuff with people
training to be newtypes through spiritual awakening and via enhancement
surgery. Though I did struggle through all of the Char bashing. And
really I was just missing Sayla. Though Murai&amp;#8217;s appearances were very
very cool. Both Salya and Murai are sort of broken characters. If they
had been around Char would have failed miserably. And Bright didn&amp;#8217;t even
attempt to sleep with anyone other than Murai&amp;#8230;tsk tsk. However he did
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan?from=Main.BrightSlap"&gt;slap&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OWN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SON&lt;/span&gt;! Hawt&amp;nbsp;damn!&lt;/p&gt;

I didn&amp;#8217;t post in haste and nor&amp;nbsp;inebriated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God Fucking Damnit, California (and Florida). Like what the fuck is the
point?&amp;nbsp;Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who seriously cares if the farshtunkeneh Democrats secured control over
the federal legislative and executive branches if they can&amp;#8217;t be godamned
bothered to uphold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt; civil liberties? Just because I may never choose
to exercise that right does not give the government or anyone else to
authority to legislate my body, or anyone&amp;#8217;s fucking&amp;nbsp;body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; I may have and still do disagree with what I observed as the
&amp;#8220;Us or Them&amp;#8221; mentality that developed on the &amp;#8216;No on 8&amp;#8217; side. But that
just means I thought the tactic was wrong and not the end result of
their goals. We rise and fall together as one state, or&amp;nbsp;nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; My prediction that either way the damn thing went, someone
would sue someone in the courts and it will ultimately be settled there
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/11/proposition-8-h.html"&gt;seems to be playing out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But no, this doesn&amp;#8217;t make anything any better for me. The reason that
everyone in my fucking corner of the world seems so goddamn happy today
is because we elected a schmuck who not only disagrees with me, but does
so for the worst of all possible reasons. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/barackobama/3388430/Barack-Obama-may-have-helped-California-Proposition-8-gay-marriage-ban-pass.html"&gt;In case you didn&amp;#8217;t
know,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbianactivism/p/BarackObama.htm"&gt;Obama doesn&amp;#8217;t believe in same-sex marriage on religious&amp;nbsp;grounds.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just elected &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANOTHER&lt;/span&gt; president who doesn&amp;#8217;t believe in the
separation of Church and State. And what do we get out of it? Maybe
universal health coverage and maybe a better economy and maybe out of
two wars in a couple of year? I would gladly use all of these coins to
pay for my liberties. Freedom at any cost! Get the goddamn government
out of our goddamn&amp;nbsp;pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the arguments which I find totally &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAME&lt;/span&gt; that have been used to
explain the situation to me, &lt;em&gt;which I completely disagree with&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) For Play-Play:&lt;/strong&gt;Obama doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it and is just said that to
get elected. This holds no water, if I am to believe that all the
candidates are always lying to me, then I really would have had to vote
for Sarah Palin. Sure you can &amp;#8216;Hope&amp;#8217; that he will &amp;#8216;Change&amp;#8217; his mind and
renege and actually utilize the once-in-a-generation opportunity to push
through Federal legislation that would end this debate&amp;#8230;but you my
friend, are living in a shanty town dreaming the union will move you to
a&amp;nbsp;mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Civil Unions:&lt;/strong&gt;Homosexuals are &amp;#8220;just going about it wrong&amp;#8221; by
demanding equality rather than asking nicely for &amp;#8220;separate but equal&amp;#8221;
status. People who seriously believe that Civil Unions are a valid
solution are just wrong. If you apply a different label, eventually
legislation will be passed that targets either marriage or civil unions,
therefore making them just separate and no longer equal. Even if you
stipulate that they must under law be treated equally we would just end
up with the marriage equivalent of a poll tax. Maybe something with
regards to how private insurance companies define&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2a) No Marriage, Just Civil Unions:&lt;/strong&gt;Rightly so, civil marriage in
this country is more like civil unions in other countries. So we should
make marriage a purely religious thing, and everyone civilly get
married. I would actually be fine with this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXCEPT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHAT&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGAINST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MARRIAGES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIVIL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNIONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACTUALLY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROPOSING&lt;/span&gt;. This is a purely academic argument and books and journals
don&amp;#8217;t marry people. You will find zero religious, married people against
gay marriage willing to give up their legal status as &amp;#8216;married&amp;#8217; so that
other people can have civil unions (them included, of&amp;nbsp;course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Nope, Never:&lt;/strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;ll simply never, ever happen/I&amp;#8217;ll never live to
see the day, so maybe I should just stop worrying about it and fighting
for it and getting upset. Fuck this shit! Who is the damnable
skeptic/cynic now?! This is the analogous opinion of those people
sitting in the mid 1950s and thinking &amp;#8220;Well, sure I know some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; black
folk, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean they&amp;#8217;ll ever be a serious political
constituency,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Sure I have some Jewish friends, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t
mean I feel there is anything wrong with landlords not allowing them to
live in my neighborhood, or come to my country club.&amp;#8221; Unjust laws
require civil disobedience, not goddamn fucking&amp;nbsp;complacency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does this leave me. I am &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AS&lt;/span&gt; upset if not more so as I was after
the 2004 presidential election. Possibly more because I didn&amp;#8217;t expect
this one. So I am back where I started. I can either fuck it all and go
get a law degree and start a practice and be a real Mensch, or I can
become a member of the Universal Life Church and just start performing
same sex marriages, or I can wait and see how it plays out in&amp;nbsp;court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr This isn&amp;#8217;t change I can believe in. We got given a bum steer again
from what it looks like. And this was the toned down&amp;nbsp;version.&lt;/p&gt;

other people on Saturday. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Chameleon"&gt;More broken things have&amp;nbsp;happened.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Jacob&amp;#8217;s Ladder (1990)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; In honor of Halloween, we watched a film
that wasn&amp;#8217;t so old, but no less forgotten. We had the opportunity to
also watch &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096251/"&gt;Tetsuo: The Iron Man&lt;/a&gt; from a year before, but some people
were too silly drunk and some people were too sleepy and and some
peoples spoon&amp;#8217;s were too&amp;nbsp;big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie itself, was pretty triptastic. It basically followed a three
parallel stories (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMG&lt;/span&gt; HeavenHellPurgatory!!1!). But the weaving was done
very well. There were many cries of &amp;#8220;Silent Hill!&amp;#8221; throughout. Even
though part of the story took place in Vietnam, this was more or less a
plot device and not sufficient commentary to be meaningful. About the
only moral lesson you could squeeze out of the Vietnam parts was that
Chemists are terrible people, but we knew that already. And they knew
that then. It is/was not news. Though I do know good chemists too. The
twist on this theme was that Chemists are worse people when they are&amp;nbsp;Hippies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the chick named Jezzie (Jezy?) was hot. Because how could she not
be? And not just because we saw her boobs. In that 30 seconds she was on
screen before she jumped into the shower with our
fantastically-out-of-his-mind hero, I thought she was cute. Even if
people mispronouncing her name sounded like penis. I swear, is
*nothing* sacred to you people? The next time you all come over and I
make drinks, you are all getting Penis&amp;nbsp;Coladas.&lt;/p&gt;

I feel the urge to burn all of my
clothes, dye my hair and generally start&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being different is by no means always a choice, nor is it always a good
thing. But I feel as if things that made me different in the past were
just signs that I am developmentally slow. I never had the compulsion to
say &amp;#8220;go to outer space&amp;#8221;, or &amp;#8220;live in another time period&amp;#8221; that so many
people did as kids. Why did these both hit me in the last week?
Shouldn&amp;#8217;t I be over them by now? Fuck, I don&amp;#8217;t even remember most of my&amp;nbsp;childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted so much to be an adult, but now that it is here&amp;#8230;It is like
life is one big groovy orgy and I recycled the invitation and told them
to stop wasting so much&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clearly need to raise my freak flag higher, but how? Everything now
has a context, and subtext[1]. Even people that don&amp;#8217;t like to be labeled
are typified by &amp;#8220;Doesn&amp;#8217;t Like to Be Labeled.&amp;#8221; It is a logical trap.
Doing anything is probably doing the wrong thing, and doing nothing is
falling into that&amp;nbsp;trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8212;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1) Not that such things didn&amp;#8217;t have associated contexts before, I simply failed to realize them. Ostensibly because I am a slow.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well known is my love for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRRM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s writing. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://grrm.livejournal.com/56810.html"&gt;Unfortunately, his home was
just broken into.&lt;/a&gt; But more proof of the man&amp;#8217;s brilliance is that he
ends his not-a-blog post about this&amp;nbsp;with,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;And somewhere out there, some asshole has my&amp;nbsp;sword.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less I have been busy last week because aside from my normal
duties, I needed to rewrite all of my work up to this point &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; get it
to work better (ie faster). Which I totally did. This version of the
code is actually fully object oriented.&amp;nbsp;Pimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I did manage to fit in my first (one-shot) game of 4th Ed. D&amp;amp;D. In
general, some things were very streamlined as compared to 3rd. Combat
still takes too long, but less time than 3rd, so this is kind of a win.
However, they took out or changed so many canonical components that it
is tough to ascribe the D&amp;amp;D label to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notorious ability to frustrate even veteran GMs is still sharp. The
only reason I bring this up is because Michael described it in a new and
apt way last night. The mentality that &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;everything is an
opportunity&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; is what throws people. You would think that this would be
toned down when I am playing dumb characters (w00t, Razza)&amp;#8230;but no,
they just see less intelligent&amp;nbsp;choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This very much stems from what I see the point of RPGs to be. If you are
going to suspend your disbelief enough to represent a person in a
&amp;#8220;magical world where anything is possible&amp;#8221;, then By Golly why would I
limit myself to just busting in the heads of fake monsters and avoiding
spiked pit&amp;nbsp;traps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better of worse, the one-shot got me all pumped up. I now feel very
compelled to run &amp;#8220;A Song of Ice and Fire&amp;#8221; game. But it will have to wait
until Michael is done with the books so at least one of the players
knows what is going on in cannon (which we would be playing inside of).
Good luck playing mages, you crazy&amp;nbsp;folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, I re-purchased &amp;#8220;Welcome to My Nightmare&amp;#8221;, since my
8-track broke. I must be dreaming, please stop&amp;nbsp;screaming!&lt;/p&gt;

Sue; Ima gonna make a name for myself, I am. Only &amp;#8220;here&amp;#8221; is my seemingly
eternal obsession with &amp;#8220;A Song of Ice and Fire&amp;#8221; and my plans basically
consist of temporarily satiating myself with other epic&amp;nbsp;literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So right now I am reading through the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana"&gt;Ramayana&lt;/a&gt;. I am really loving
the ride. As sort of a Classics guy, the Ramayana fires off all of those
lovely Indo-European neurons that I have carefully developed to the
detriment of more practical affairs. To those of you that know
classicists, you know *exactly* what I am talking about. To those of
you that don&amp;#8217;t, it is kind of like being the biggest D&amp;amp;D nerd in the
world &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXCEPT&lt;/span&gt; that the only people you can play with are either dead or
in your&amp;nbsp;imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on all of the awesome little titbits later; suffice to say it is
exhilarating in that way that when you &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; read the Odyssey, or the
Arthurian legends, or Beowulf, etc. But there is one topic which has so
much cross over that it deserves its own post. And I have been thinking
about it lately, as well: &lt;strong&gt;Guest Right&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest Right was a legal, moral, ethical tradition that was held
throughout vast portions of the ancient world but which is now all but
forgotten. It more or less says that guests hold a sacred position in
their hosts abode. Guest right was triggered in different ways, but
breaking it was almost always considered sacrilegious. Here are a couple
of&amp;nbsp;examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; To the Greeks (and others) it was not permissible to ask your
guest&amp;#8217;s name or business unless they offered it. A great example of this
is when Odysseus washes up on an island and is hosted by the&amp;nbsp;Phaeacians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; A more extreme Greek example occurs in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pages.cabrini.edu/jzurek/homer/iliad06.htm"&gt;Book 6 of the Iliad&lt;/a&gt;.
Diomedes and Glaucus, mortal enemies on opposing sides realized that
Diomedes&amp;#8217; grandfather once hosted Glaucus&amp;#8217; grandfather. They therefore
just *have* to be friends and run off and happily kill other people.
These seems strange to the modern ear, but sets the stage for&amp;nbsp;when&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; In the Ramayana, the sage Vishwaamitra is given guest right by
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasaratha"&gt;King Dasaratha&lt;/a&gt; (Rama&amp;#8217;s father). Now the king had to perform an
amazing and expensive ritual just to have children. This ritual amounted
to having a horse roam free for a year (while an army followed it,
maintaining it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;freedom&amp;#8221;) before sacrificing it. But Vishwaamitra
walks in when Rama is 15 and is granted a guest right boon. He demands
Rama to help him kill some Raksasas. The King is reticent but,
ultimately guest right wins out and Rama leaves with the sage. Puts the
Abraham-Issac story in&amp;nbsp;perspective&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, it is possible for a guest to break guest right.
For instance, being a suitor to another man&amp;#8217;s wife and living off the
fat of his land for 20 years, like in the&amp;nbsp;Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, those are all nice stories, but I swear I am going somewhere with&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often been discontented with modern interpretation of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lot_(Bible)"&gt;Story
of Lot&lt;/a&gt;. Modernity has forgotten about guest right. But Judaism (as an
ancient religion) has a strong tradition of Guest Right, and generally
not forsaking strangers and sojourners for we were once strangers and
sojourners. This is certainly lost in today&amp;#8217;s world. There are so many
strangers, we hardly care. We can&amp;#8217;t even open half-way houses&amp;nbsp;anymore&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lot kinda gets the shaft in recent interpretations. In fact, he is
often cited as why the Torah represents an outdated, outmoded codex. The
bleeding edge example of this is Bill Maher in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lionsgate.com/religulous/"&gt;Religulous&lt;/a&gt;. However,
if we throw guest right back in with all of its intensity, Lot gets a
different&amp;nbsp;take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the mob descends on Lot&amp;#8217;s family, the angels (though their divinity
was unknown to Lot, as per standard guest right) were under Lot&amp;#8217;s
protection. Though the mob was doing a grave injustice to him, Lot was
trying to maintain what he could of civility. Yes, offering up his
daughters was is a shitty thing to do. But to the ancient moral compass
it was the lesser of two&amp;nbsp;evils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern dialogue frames Lot as the real villain (or at least anti-hero)
in this situation. They fail to account for the frame or reference in
which the Torah was both written &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; received. Moreover, these
interpretations gloss over the fact that the mob are in fact the ones
committing the&amp;nbsp;crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests *were* people to be honoured and revered; not to be thrown out
even before the garbage that is our modern capitalistic
every-one-for-themselves way. If you wanna talk about the evils of
patriarchy and homophobia, there are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLENTY&lt;/span&gt; of current examples without
turning to a misinterpreted parable from&amp;nbsp;ages-gone-by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Totally my two cents,&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

I am sitting at 133, beat that! I am
a lone seven off from being completely&amp;nbsp;leet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is kind of a misnomer this week, since I was otherwise occupied
Friday night so I wanted my film on Saturday. But you won&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;tell..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Nights of Caribia (1957)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; Damn it, I am in love with other dead
woman! The lead actress &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giulietta_Masina"&gt;Giulietta Masina&lt;/a&gt; I don&amp;#8217;t have words to
describe. Suffice to say she was good enough for Fellini to marry (and
stay with). Masina was also the star of another amazing Fellini flick,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047528/"&gt;La Strada&lt;/a&gt;, that I saw a few years back. She really is a spectacular&amp;nbsp;actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never seen a Fellini film, they are intense and emotionally
draining. This was certainly amplified by my schoolgirl crush on Masina,
if not the character of Caribiria. I actually had to pause the movie a
couple of times and go watch Michael play Lego Star Wars because I was
so caught up in it. I loved every minute of the&amp;nbsp;movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This film is more of a character portrait than a story, as neo-realism
is apt to be. There really is a lot to talk about here (why magicians
&amp;#8220;succeed&amp;#8221; where the Holy Mother fails, Italian post-war slums,
self-referential movies and film makers), but why bore you with all of
that when I can just talk about how gorgeous Masina&amp;nbsp;is?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;ll compromise. Masina herself, &amp;#8220;Nights of Cabiria&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;La Strada&amp;#8221;
all combine in a very interesting way. The character of Luisa/&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000733/"&gt;Anouk
Aimee&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/"&gt;8 1/2&lt;/a&gt; is the wife of the in-story director. Fellini has
been accused of being self indulgent in &amp;#8220;8 1/2&amp;#8221; since the the in-story
director is easily associated with Fellini himself. (The most famous of
these accusations is, of course, in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075686/"&gt;Annie Hall&lt;/a&gt;.) But if Fellini is
the director then Masina is represented by Luisa. This film is then far
from self-indulgent. After talking about the really serious, and frankly
sad, issues in his films with Masina, why shouldn&amp;#8217;t Fellini be allowed
to start another film with dream sequence and end it with a Ferris
wheel? Isn&amp;#8217;t he then talking about where such depressing movies actually
come from rather than just making them (a theme I would argue he
continues with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066922/"&gt;Clowns&lt;/a&gt;). And &amp;#8220;8 1/2&amp;#8221; itself is no cake&amp;nbsp;walk&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even when I saw &amp;#8220;8 1/2&amp;#8221; originally, I thought Luisa was hot. Who
knew that it was actually a crush on Giulietta Masina? I actually tried
to use Lusia as a pet name once but this got shot down pretty quick.
However it was meant with all love and respect (Dil saywhat?!). I think
I even have an email somewhere talking about how cute I thought the girl
in &amp;#8220;La Strada&amp;#8221; was (ie&amp;nbsp;Masina).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this movie ended blew my mind though. But you will just have to
see it for&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;: In response to myself in this post, I now have a &amp;#8220;Dead Women
I&amp;#8217;d Bang&amp;#8221;. As the list grows, so too does my shame&amp;nbsp;^_~.*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we approach this election there seems to be a lot of intolerance
whizzing about. And not just from you traditional right-wing
fundamentalist sources. I see it as much from my left leaning friends
and even those I would consider moderates&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, people, this is&amp;nbsp;unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our choices should not be reduced to &amp;#8220;Hope or Die&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Drill or go fuck
yourself&amp;#8221;. Stephen Colbert, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15116383"&gt;in his interview on Fresh Air&lt;/a&gt;, talks
about fighting the Culture&amp;nbsp;War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture War? Is this what we want? Is another war of any sort really
needed? And this is exactly what he is fighting in. I am not
presupposing that he started it, but he certainly profits by its&amp;nbsp;continuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This path is treacherous. We could end up thrusting ourselves into
another edition of the 1960s. Or we could start another *real* civil
war. If you want two Americas, you can have it. &lt;strong&gt;Is this what you
want?!&lt;/strong&gt; This is were we are going with are present dialogue, and lack
thereof. Even John Lennon wanted to be counted out of&amp;nbsp;revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this can all be avoided if you (and a bunch of your friends) decide
to be more tolerant of those around you. I am not saying you need to
abandon your principles. However, I am asking that you distinguish
between you having an intense disagreement with an idea or belief and
hating those whom hold that&amp;nbsp;belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Disagree with them: Yes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Despise them: No.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe compassion is a virtue, and maybe you don&amp;#8217;t have the time, but I
swear you have something to gain by not thinking that half of the world
hates you because you hate&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple of hot button issues where you can&amp;nbsp;start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) To the No on `Prop 8`_&amp;nbsp;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen, your cause is fundamentally about the oppression of people.
You do your cause a grave injustice by being intolerant of those who
hold a different opinion. You should try to convince them, not disregard
them as stupid. Start with basics, like being afforded &amp;#8220;life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness&amp;#8221; and to actively oppress people is
inherently unAmerican. In fact this is exactly what the people who do
form an existential threat (ie the terrorists) do to their own. If they
bring up any sort of religious argument, you need only to bring up the
separation of church and state. Make them frame their arguments (and you
yours) solely on the basis of law and areligious morality. If they force
you into a religious argument, throw out that the Torah allows
lesbianism, and thus at least lesbians should be allowed to marry. But
if you allow lesbians but not gays then that is sexist&amp;#8230; Rather than
hating on people next door/next city/next county you should do what Dan
Savage says and money to the No on 8 organization. And&amp;nbsp;vote!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) To the Yes on `Prop 8`_&amp;nbsp;People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a fundamentally intolerant viewpoint. I am not
saying you need to jump into writing homoerotic fan fiction. But what is
so wrong with people living different than you? Only half of those
people murdered in Germany&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; death camps were Jewish, the other
half were a mish-mosh of Catholics, Gypsies, old and infirm, and a whole
lot of homosexuals. If you want to convince the other side that you are
right, you have an uphill battle. There may be an argument to be made
for civil unions. But I would think that this would fall under the
&amp;#8220;Separate but Equal&amp;#8221; category that got us so far before the civil rights
movement. Also, don&amp;#8217;t hate your friendly gay neighbor for their life of
sin, just donate money to your organization. And&amp;nbsp;vote!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3)&amp;nbsp;Atheists:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big category, so rather than having a lot of qualifiers and
explaining things for various types of unbelievers, &lt;strong&gt;I am only talking
about fundamentalist, intolerant atheists&lt;/strong&gt;. Let&amp;#8217;s start with a song,&amp;nbsp;huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.F.&lt;/span&gt; Sloan wrote in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_of_Destruction_(song)"&gt;Eve of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Hate your next door
neighbor but don&amp;#8217;t forget to say Grace.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should *not* interpret this as there is no god(s), so I may hate
my neighbor freely. (Which I fear goes on a lot.) Rather you should
instead read this as reaffirming that your moral code comes from
something other than a divinely inspired place. And those &amp;#8216;religious&amp;#8217;
folk don&amp;#8217;t seem to be any better people because of their&amp;nbsp;beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tolerance is irrespective one&amp;#8217;s beliefs. You can and should be accepting
of other peoples guaranteed right to believe whatever they want. This is
no reason to hate someone. If they are wise, then they won&amp;#8217;t hate you
for yours&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, atheists, were do you get off re-appropriating the Bohr atom and
Darwin to your cause? You have to know that this doesn&amp;#8217;t help. Science
(and it symbols you are stealing) is more or less &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionist"&gt;reductionist&lt;/a&gt;. While
your belief is strictly founded on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism"&gt;holism&lt;/a&gt;. You can&amp;#8217;t point to
evolution and say &amp;#8220;Thusly god doesn&amp;#8217;t exist.&amp;#8221; You are still presupposing
*something*. Darwin doesn&amp;#8217;t come into it. And if someone were to take
all of the universe in all time and point to it and say &amp;#8220;This gigantic,
teeming differential equation is god.&amp;#8221; Even then should you disagree,
you would be assuming the same amount they are. How much stock someone
puts in the atom shouldn&amp;#8217;t be grounds for possibly killing them and
their descendants. Science is just a collection of models that sometimes
engineers build things with. It isn&amp;#8217;t your robot love&amp;nbsp;slave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I am intolerant of intolerance. But don&amp;#8217;t hate &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I have a vested interest in promoting tolerance. Whenever
anyone anywhere is intolerant, my people somehow get the short end of
the stick. So if it helps, think of it like this. If you hate a group of
people for their beliefs, you are really hating the Jews. And remember
this time we &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t&amp;#8221; have nukes. Klaatu barada&amp;nbsp;nikto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;: I saw &amp;#8220;Religulous&amp;#8221; this weekend, and I feel I should add &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scienceandhalacha.org/"&gt;these
people&lt;/a&gt; to the list of cute, yet misused scientific&amp;nbsp;symbols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I submitted my first journal article for peer-review.
Awesome. But I have been dog tired since then. Gripped with near
complete apathy, I didn&amp;#8217;t even want to&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally called it time to go to bed, I thought I would read a few
pages of &amp;#8220;The Hedge Knight&amp;#8221; before collapsing. Insomnia took over and I
ended up rereading the whole damn thing. I was quite pleased by this,
for I feared I would dream again this&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fears were well founded. I had hoped that the &amp;#8220;Knight&amp;#8221; would bring me
dreams of the dragon, but instead I found my family turned to undead. I
felt this bound to happen, and had hoped to avoid&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

patch that let&amp;#8217;s you catch and use NPCs in&amp;nbsp;Pokeballs.**&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok Now for the real&amp;nbsp;deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Copacabana (1947)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; I am not entirely sure that this movie
constitutes as &amp;#8220;forgotten&amp;#8221;, but it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hilarious. The team-up between
Groucho Marx and Carmen &amp;#8220;Shut-My-Mouse&amp;#8221; Miranda is wonderfully awkward.
They both have very developed humor styles that are very different from
one another, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXCEPT&lt;/span&gt; that neither one is willing to play the
straight-person. It is a true clash of these titanic personalities.
However, the film was smart enough to give them each ample time on
screen with out the other one around. Even though it clearly had
shortcomings in other&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about every word that came out of Groucho&amp;#8217;s mouth I was laughing
at. And his song, &amp;#8220;Go West, Young Man&amp;#8221; (or somesuch), I was on the floor
for. It made absolutely no sense&amp;#8230;and was spectacular. However, I still
got the feeling that someone was holding him back on his racier jokes.
The one that did stick with me though was, &amp;#8220;How can you think I don&amp;#8217;t
want to marry you? We&amp;#8217;ve been engaged 10&amp;nbsp;years!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carmen was around in all of her usual camp, and more or less playing
herself. At one point she has to prove her identity by making out with a
man who in real life is probably a faygale. So, you know, even then it
came full&amp;nbsp;circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all a very funny &amp;#8216;40s movie. Truly something for everyone, since
there probably exists a camp-pun axis on which most people lie. That is
to say that one likely either prefers camp or puns and dislikes the
other in the inverse proportion. Rare is the soul who likes both &lt;em&gt;(and
if you are reading this and do, you have a standing offer for a date)&lt;/em&gt;.
But &amp;#8220;Copacabana&amp;#8221; does such a good job of balancing these elements, it
would be hard for someone to say that they didn&amp;#8217;t at least truly enjoy
some&amp;nbsp;parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, my latest batch of Gundam DVDs has now shipped. This week
hopefully! And I thought it was a&amp;nbsp;scam&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

reflections on last year and the year to&amp;nbsp;come&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.utexas.edu/news/2008/09/10/flow_conference/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLOW&lt;/span&gt; Conference&lt;/a&gt; is currently being held where I am writing this.
I expected a higher proportion of hot girls than I am getting. Not that
there are a few gems, but from what I have seen most fix into the
&amp;#8220;traditionally beautiful&amp;#8221; category. And one lady who looked similar to
Kerry (I&amp;#8217;ll let you guess which one ^_^).&amp;nbsp;Boh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am now the proud owner of Five (5)
new yeast infections. This is important because I am finally going to
kick the ends of these warts. These parasitic growths *are* (soon to
be &amp;#8220;were&amp;#8221;) all that is/was wrong with certain unnamed iron warships and
those who manned them and my family and school and etc. As much as I
wanted to be rid of them, they tied me to those people, places, and
events. But biting your problems just makes them grow back worse.
Dermatologists should push into the life coach field. I think they&amp;#8217;d do&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; As I mentioned before, my apologies
went well. That was slightly disingenuous since at the time of the
writing, I hadn&amp;#8217;t actually received responses from half of the people.
But now I have or it is tooooooo late. And the last batch was&amp;nbsp;successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Because I had such an intense rest of
the High Holidays, Yom Kippur I was just phoning in. This mostly worked,
but then at the end, as the Gates were closing, everything I hadn&amp;#8217;t
thought about hit me. Yizkor is always&amp;nbsp;powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I am shaken by the rift that have
appeared in some of my friend&amp;#8217;s relationships. I will likely take Sal&amp;#8217;s
lead since he is on the ground. But there is this little part of me too
that is almost excited in a terrible way. A couple of weeks before this,
my friends in Bay Area were also having issues. Now I seem to always be
in the off-cycle. That is to say that whenever the people I know are in
loving, stable, long term relationships, then I am not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; vice versa.
So other people&amp;#8217;s lives falling apart may yet be a portent of
good-tidings for me! Is this not&amp;nbsp;awful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On A Totally Unrelated Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I noticed some interesting things in
the Machzor this year that I have missed before. Judaism has strong
anti-Hellenic and anti-pagan trends. (This are clearly picked up the
Christians and Muslims, though not in a healthy way since they are not
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henotheism"&gt;henotheistic&lt;/a&gt;.) But Jews as a rule aren&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;anti-panhellenic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of my favorite transgressions that is recited is more or less
&amp;#8220;Forgive us for being Xenophobic.&amp;#8221; This always gets me. If ever there
were a (still-living) people that had every right to be afraid of
outsiders in all ages and eras, it certainly must be us. But then right
there in the Torah are many statues that say &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t do X, because your
pagan neighbors do&amp;nbsp;it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the combined message is that we are a people set apart, but not to
hate on the basis that others practice differently. Not really the way
evangelicals of any religion&amp;nbsp;act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is where is gets juicy. One would still expect that any religious
practices, though, would be completely free from the sorts of beliefs
that those silly Greeks held. Especially on Yom Kippur. Two main
instances I put together this&amp;nbsp;year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Blood Magic:&lt;/strong&gt; For lack of a better term. Now the Jewish belief of
the sacredness of blood differs considerably from the Greek belief that
blood can be used to entrance someone. However, both peoples have this
distinct belief that blood has a very distinct meanings. Of note, the
Torah portions for Yom Kippur describe in vivid detail that would make a
horror writer cry how the High Priest of Temples days would perform the
High Holy Days sacrifices. Really grabbed me this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Dust:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a couple of times where we beseech Hashem to
remember that we are dust. I don&amp;#8217;t know why this didn&amp;#8217;t hit me before,
but this has got to be directly tied to the Sumeric belief in the &amp;#8220;House
of Dust.&amp;#8221; This is their version of the afterlife that is only less stark
than the Jews themselves (who generally see the question of what happens
after death as irrelevant and unknowable). But the House of Dust is a
place that is sort of a formless windy medium. Gilgamesh manages to go
there and come back (as with many Hellenic heros). But the fact that
people become dust after they die is such a powerful notion that I think
even the staunchest of atheists of our day would be hard to deny. In
fact, since plants get most of their constituent carbon from the
atmosphere, and since we eat either mostly plants or mostly vegetarians,
we truly do come from dust, replenished by dust, and bound to return to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to look at the world and keep a good thought. But this year
can be better. And it can&amp;#8217;t be all that bad since Jon Stewart mad a joke
about the Obamas and the McCains swinging&amp;#8230;to Michelle&amp;nbsp;Obama!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust never sleeps, but it is not what sunk your battleship. Better to
infect these parasites and be done with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

reads this too! But he made it past the first 80 pages without throwing
it down (I am looking at you,&amp;nbsp;Anthony).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, that it has gotten to the point where I have felt this
real compulsion to play some 2 Ed. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;D or, barring that, Castles &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
Crusades or HackMaster or something. Something with gulldamn&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;Gnomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have found ways to satiate myself in other ways, thankfully.
One of them is of course the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRL&lt;/span&gt; OKCupid Minigame. The other is more&amp;nbsp;oblivious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ain&amp;#8217;t the Total Package yet, but is so wrong to want more&amp;nbsp;ass?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; Little edgy as tonight is Yom Kippur. Never know when Israel will
implode or Synagogues fired upon. It seems wrong that there are
justifiable neuroses on what is arguably the second most important
holiday. I *still* find the Tet&amp;nbsp;offensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPS&lt;/span&gt; Is anyone else disturbed by the amount of Sarah Palin-esque
straight-male-targeted porn that is popping up on the internet these

Palin&amp;nbsp;was&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

proved to be unfounded but others I am still downright giddy&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There really is something to be said for this tradition. You know even
if it doesn&amp;#8217;t work the first, second, or Nth year, next year it just
might. And then you can treat people like human beings and move forward
into the future&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week is very very cramped though. I have a presentation the day
after Yom Kippur and the professor is Jewish even. But I also have to
have a paper ready to submit on Sunday at 4pm. And of course, a day and
a half are taken out of this week because of Yom Kippur itself and I am
still working on backlog from last week&amp;#8217;s New&amp;nbsp;Year.&lt;/p&gt;

computer monitor in my room. It wasn&amp;#8217;t getting a signal with a input
plug I had never used before. So I laboriously took the *whole* damn
thing apart and then cleared it out and put it back together. Nothing.
Nothing on the internet either. Then I realized that it was a resolution
problem coming from the system itself. &amp;#8216;Doh! I felt like an idiot. Still
not picture with the new resolution, but at least I have a&amp;nbsp;signal&amp;#8230;.bastards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, I have had a remarkably relaxing weekend of old media. Here
are the&amp;nbsp;reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`The Long Goodbye (1973)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; A couple of weeks ago I decided to watch
an old movie every Friday night. This week it was the remake of the Long
Goodbye. Eliot Gould was excellent as he was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; Humphrey Bogart, which
is something you really have to try hard to avoid. The most interesting
thing about this picture though, was its cross-genre-pollination. Since
it was a remake of a movie based off of a Raymond Chandler novel, it was
guaranteed Noir. However, since it was made in the early &amp;#8216;70s, it also
had a very Exploitation feel. Very, very strange. But still very fun.
The only other film that comes to mind that does this is &amp;#8220;Chinatown&amp;#8221;,
but it really isn&amp;#8217;t even&amp;nbsp;close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`The Scarlet Letter (1934)`_:&lt;/strong&gt; I watched this last week. And I of
course watched it because my new favorite silent super-hottie &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.colleenmoore.org/"&gt;Collen
Moore&lt;/a&gt; was in it. This film was a talkie and her first &amp;#8220;serious&amp;#8221; work
and one of the last films she ever did. However, it was beautifully
acted and the script was true as the righteous half of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.janusfilms.com/"&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt;. The
only place that they deviated from the book was in the addition of a
comic relief duo. But as this duo were simply Penn &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Teller 70 years
ago, I didn&amp;#8217;t mind a lick. It was very silent film in a lot of ways,
which I always appreciate. And these people must have spent the majority
of their budget on costumes. As always, I would commit the sin of
adultery and many others with Collen&amp;nbsp;Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Son of Rambow`_:&lt;/strong&gt; For laughs I watched this on Saturday. It was
good, but not as awesome as I expected. The main story was somewhat less
interesting than they billed it. However, there were some very
trippy/surreal moments. Oh! How did that grab me?! Worth watching,&amp;nbsp;once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;`Sworn Sword`_:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMG&lt;/span&gt;!!! I waited like a year to find this, and it was
awesome! &amp;#8220;Sworn Sword&amp;#8221; is of course the sequel to the graphic novel
&amp;#8220;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hedge-Knight-Vol-Book-Market/dp/0785125787/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b"&gt;The Hedge Knight&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. Both are based off of George &lt;span class="caps"&gt;R.R.&lt;/span&gt; Martin short
stories. This run seemed to only be half the length (6 issues) of the
first one (~10-12). I also must be getting good predicting Martin&amp;#8217;s
work. This is because literally the frame in which the last main
character was introduced is when I knew exactly how the rest of the
story would play out. I am not talking about major events. I am saying I
knew every little plot point and twist and turn of the story for the
next 3 issues down to a tee. I didn&amp;#8217;t miss a one! I didn&amp;#8217;t even have to
read her dialogue in that first frame to know any of this either. Part
of this must be that Martin is very good at dropping subtle hints that
if you apply logic to, you can know what happens. Meanwhile, he (through
his characters) is feeding you outright lies about the situation at hand
sometimes. Being adept at picking up his hints is a learned skill. But
you know what, it didn&amp;#8217;t even bother me. If knowing what was going to
happen in the story bothered me, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have reread the book so many
times (round 7 go!). I nom&amp;#8217;d it like it was hawt. I would even venture
to say that I have a fairly good idea as to what will happen if he
writes future short stories in this thread. And I just had a terrible
thought: Dunk/Egg slash. Well, Seeya next&amp;nbsp;post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All apologies this time around seem to be going &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well this year.
If you haven&amp;#8217;t gotten yours yet, you will. I still have a&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially satisfying was an email to a certain super-marine&amp;nbsp;Squid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a totally unrelated note:&lt;/strong&gt; Being single suddenly seems a lot less
glorious than it did&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a totally unrelated note:&lt;/strong&gt; Some of you deserve better ground rules
than I have been permeating. As &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heero_Yuy"&gt;Heero Yui&lt;/a&gt; might say, &amp;#8220;Mission
Parameters: [to be] Set. Proceeding with Mission.&amp;#8221; But let&amp;#8217;s not be&amp;nbsp;naive&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a totally unrelated note:&lt;/strong&gt; It has been recalled to my attention
that I am no longer interesting, by my own insistence. I agree that I
should be. I&amp;#8217;m agonna reaffirm my feet here somehow. Fuck you grad
school and your boring obesity on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIFE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

All&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research again yesterday. I think most of you know that I
think &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIE&lt;/span&gt;. However, upon this latest medical round I think I
may have &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.medhelp.org/medical-information/show/983/Crohns-disease"&gt;Crohn&amp;#8217;s Disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fit two out of the three risk factors, some of the symptoms, and the
overlying cause resonates well with the data I have. Basically, one&amp;#8217;s
mind tells one&amp;#8217;s stomach that anything and everything you put in it is
bad. Thus your body ends up rejecting all food,&amp;nbsp;violently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would explain why none of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBS&lt;/span&gt; medicines worked for more than a
week. Also it explains why my systematic elimination of all food-types
at one point or another did nothing (you know, because I was still
eating). [Note: food elimination, once you find the culprit, really
helps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBS&lt;/span&gt; patients in general. For me it made things worse because I
would typically have to eat more, especially during the vegan and
wheat/gluten free&amp;nbsp;months.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do we go from here. Well before I go to a doctor again, I am
gonna run one last experiment; &lt;strong&gt;I am going to stop eating&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If food itself the problem, then this should solve my stomach problem. I
will attempt to achieve sustenance through emergency survival pills like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lifecaps.net/"&gt;Life Caps&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, I will be sure to drink plenty of water too. I
may supplement with sugar pills to increase calorie&amp;nbsp;intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll start with a three day trial run. If shows results, it&amp;#8217;ll be
essentially proved in my mind. Then I might be able to set up some sort
of system where I don&amp;#8217;t eat 3, 4, or 5 days out of the week. I&amp;#8217;ll go to
a doctor and nutritionist to talk about&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I wake up dead, &lt;em&gt;you&amp;#8217;ll&lt;/em&gt; know why. It is like my body is rejecting
my life. As if I needed something else to do&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;

people, totally a joke, no&amp;nbsp;worries.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But tonight I want to focus on last winters &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lilith.org/backissues_detail.htm?id=138&amp;amp;keyword=&amp;amp;PHPSESSID=fe8616202be76ce310ca843cb27bbd58"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;. For those of you

I bought my copy from at Intellectual Property I think was a little
confused. Seriously more awkward than buying&amp;nbsp;porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up this issue for its feature article (even better than a
battle royale of presidential candidates): &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Is JDate Good For Jewish
Women?&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; Their answer, a determined&amp;nbsp;yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well not quite, but they fail to enumerate any good JDate does whereas
the article focuses on the seven (7) specific bad things. So even though
I am a few paragraphs in I haven&amp;#8217;t said anything yet. So let me start by
saying that reading this article was a pure joy on so many levels.
Really, the best way to go about this is a series of quotes and&amp;nbsp;discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Some women, largely those in their twenties, happily use the sites
[e-dating] for casual sex and hook-ups; others - even those in their
seventies - go online for cybersex, typing racy exchanges while
masturbating in their darkened&amp;nbsp;kitchens.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hawt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;How many times have you heard this exchange? &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;ve met someone
terrific.&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;Great. What does he do?&amp;#8217; I long for the day when the
response, instead is &amp;#8216;What&amp;#8217;s he like? How does he treat you? What does
the connection feel&amp;nbsp;like?&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually quite true. I know I am guilty of it &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; I think I care
about accomplishments of mates a lot less than the average person. If
you can be poor and happy, or if you wanna support someone, or be
supported by someone, or whatever, you should totally do it. At the end
of the day it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter. I agree with this sentiment entirely. But
you can only change yourself, so call me on it if you see me buying into
the standard&amp;nbsp;metric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;A 42-year-old Jewish man posts his profile on JDate and finds his
inbox flooded with 1,000 eligible women. How come the same-age Jewish
female logs on to find she&amp;#8217;d a&amp;nbsp;wallflower?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really? I mean really? Sure maybe there may be some amount of disparity,
but this implications for this are huge! Does this mean there is a pool
of 42-year-old Jewish woman ass that I have yet to tap&amp;nbsp;into?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness though, this provides the perfect opportunity to dust
off the old the social engineering experiments hat. It might be time to
buckle down and buy a JDate account to tool around on it like with
OKCupid. The thousand-to-zero ratio they give I am sure are more aimed
toward Jewish centers like the City, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; (damn coastal elites)
but I am confident we could get decent results out of Austin as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Our expectations for relationships are so much higher than in the
past, but we haven&amp;#8217;t built in a mechanism for learning how to get to&amp;nbsp;there.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a commentary about the feminist movement in the past 30
years. Talking about that would fill volumes. The point is applicable to
the general population though as well. If you really do buy into the
standard set of norms and pressures, the bar for both career and
relationship expectations has been set very high. While children are
taught how to succeed academically and given support system in
institutions throughout the entirety of their career, the same is not
true emotionally. People are told that *must* be happy and *must* in
some sort of relationship with a person who is similarly successful.
However no one is ever really taught how to go about doing this or what
that means or whether it will actually make them happy. Even people who
have these &amp;#8216;qualities&amp;#8217; seem to me to be incapable of imparting how they
got to such a point, assuming they are even aware they have them. The
grass is always greener after&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8211;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8230;there are a significant number of males who wouldn&amp;#8217;t be dating at
all if the internet weren&amp;#8217;t an&amp;nbsp;option.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, just wow. They said it so I didn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all the article had some interesting insights and I would
*highly* recommend reading it should you ever run across a copy.
However, it certainly exists in a personal framework as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was growing up (5-15 years) I was a bit of a nerd and I was
&lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; told something along the lines of &amp;#8220;girls will ignore you from
high school through college, but if you stick with the science thing,
after college you will be more successful and buxom blonds will rain
from the heavens.&amp;#8221; More or less. You get the gist. As it turns out, for
me, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAS&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOTAL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That this sort of thinking is at least partially wrong is strongly
reflected in what the commentary that &amp;#8220;Lilith&amp;#8221; makes. I connect with
them on this one and generally agree, even if the specifics points of
contention. (I, for one, think that it is totally cool for grannies to
wank it while cybering. In their kosher kitchen or&amp;nbsp;elsewhere.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure my relationship problems aren&amp;#8217;t related to trying to shatter glass
ceilings for other women. But I was getting a lot more play when being a
nerdy was still dumb and not mainstreamed (before the first Lord of the
Rings movie). So now, at the time when I would have otherwise been at
some sort of sexual peak, I instead have become just another apple on
the poser&amp;nbsp;tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something wrong with both of these situations. Sure it is my
fault for buying into what people told me, as it is with these women who
prioritized their careers far above their desire to build a
relationship. But the kludgy solution of JDate can&amp;#8217;t be all bad for all
of these women. Or the old ladies. Or the twentysumthins. As for me, my
answer lies down a different&amp;nbsp;path&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

post this. Basically I am calling the November &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Presidential election
for the McCain/Palin ticket. We can place bets later, but here are my&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese are finally getting around to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUST6602920080922"&gt;breaking up their one-party
system&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is always hard to do in a parliamentary system
where last ditch efforts to form a coalition government are typically&amp;nbsp;successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, out of Israel last week &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;amp;sid=aEVOwGS6w8Og"&gt;we have similar news&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I have
never really been a fan of the Kadima party, but to their credit they
are far more moderate than many of the minor Israeli&amp;nbsp;parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even still, I can get behind &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzipi_Livni"&gt;Tzipi Livni&lt;/a&gt;. I think she is much more
pragmatic and moderate than Sharon and Olmert were (at least where it
counts [the Palestinian&amp;nbsp;situation]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is the clincher: if she can form a coalition government she
becomes the next Prime Minister. (In the West there is a lot of talk
about her being the &amp;#8220;Second Female Israeli &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;, as if this somehow
matters, since the Democrats failed to elect Hilary Clinton. Really I
don&amp;#8217;t think this matters one bit, and really isn&amp;#8217;t a novelty in a way.
Don&amp;#8217;t be fooled by the media in any way. The *only* way it could
matter is if the Arab world doesn&amp;#8217;t see her as being &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;
hostile on issues like the Palestinians and Lebanon, like they were with
her two predecessors [rightly so, as it turns out].) However, the
timeline of events works out such that Livni will either be the new
Prime Minister a couple of weeks before the November election -&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt;-
Israel also has to go to a general&amp;nbsp;election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, it looks fairly likely that Livni will be able to pull out
some sort of government. And this is my central point. Life isn&amp;#8217;t good
enough to me for both Obama *and* Livni to succeed, so McCain will
probably win. Mark my&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually a safe bet for me either way if you think about it. So
who is up for it? I got $5+ on Livni forming a coalition government by
the November elections and becoming prime minister and then McCain
grabbing the presidency. We got 3 other combinations here (7 if you
wanna throw in Japan), any&amp;nbsp;takers?&lt;/p&gt;

run away on&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my last update I headed to Zurich and did a walking tour of the
town. The points of interest are as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Grossmuenster Church:&lt;/strong&gt; This was the church that the eminent
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwingli"&gt;Zwingli&lt;/a&gt; presided in. If I had to pick a Christian hero, tops would
certainly be Joan of Arc. But a *very* close second would be Zwingli.
His teachings were very much in Jewish Rationalist tradition (eg Rambam,
Spinoza), if not intentionally. Also, rad statue of Charlemagne (likely
my 3rd Christian hero) in the&amp;nbsp;crypts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Fraumuenster Church:&lt;/strong&gt; Former abbey that has a a ton of
beautiful stained class windows done by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Chagall"&gt;Marc Chagall&lt;/a&gt;. You know, the
nice Jewish&amp;nbsp;painter&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Zurich Synagogue:&lt;/strong&gt; I found it, but it was locked and I couldn&amp;#8217;t
go inside. Looked to be more of a Sephardic construction, which
interested me. Also, the iron work on the outside was a repeating
pattern of pentagons-inscribed-within-pentagrams. Where&amp;#8217;s the Mogen
David, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt;? Kissed the mezuzah and&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Rietberg Museum:&lt;/strong&gt; Zurich has 50 odd museums so I had to be a
little choosy. So I went for the one that was only a moderate hike
though a park (I kid you not) called the Arboretum. The museum featured
mostly Ancient Asian works, with a smattering of works by indigenous
populations of Africa, Pacific Islanders, and the Americas (including
Inuits!). They had a really good selection of Japanese wood cut prints,
which is something I am very into. I love the idea of inventing a method
for cheap, mass-produced artwork and then immediately using it for porn.
The best quote off of one of these was &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Going home or living abroad are
the same thing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;. However, their rotating section was even cooler. It
was an illustrated (using old paintings from the 16-1700s) walk-through
of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana"&gt;Ramayana&lt;/a&gt;. This of course being one of the oft-overlooked
highly influential pieces of ancient mythology. One of the better museum
exhibits I have ever&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I may have been a bit harsh on Switzerland before. It just
took me a few days to adjust. The real proof to this was that my last
night there was of course the night that I started dreaming in German
again. (Not that my dreams weren&amp;#8217;t still nightmares, but eh, you can&amp;#8217;t
win em&amp;nbsp;all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich is a really neat. I would totally go back. I am even toying with
the idea of applying to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CERN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.psi.ch/index_e.shtml"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; post-grad-school, assuming I
pass my quals. You know, get out of the country for a while and as an
alternative to Los Alamos or some Academic thing here. There are a
number of Asian institutes that are very good as well, but I can at
least pretend to know the language in Switzerland. Also, they have the
benefit of not being in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;, which I can talk more about&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on one final note: whoever moved my table and couch while I was
away, please refrain from *ever* doing this again. I know it was only
by a couple of inches. However, I navigate around my place with the
lights off at night. I rely heavily on my mental map to do this,&amp;nbsp;so&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

I had a
good time at least. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Interlaken#"&gt;I have added some more pictures of my hotel room
here in Interlaken&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now Erich and I start our long trip home. Because the our flight
leaves at 10 am from Zurich, and the train from Interlaken to Zurich
takes a few hours, we have to be in Zurich tonight. So I will get to do
some sightseeing around the city as our hotel is downtown. Then we wake
up and get on a plane. Assuming that there are no delays, I will be
arriving back in Austin on Friday afternoon. Though my computer tells me
it is now 2 am &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CST&lt;/span&gt; on Thursday, this means I will be coming back
tomorrow&amp;#8230;but really it seems like three days from now to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Erich gave the talk on my work. I think it went very well.
His was the best talk (ie got the most number of interested,
non-super-critical questions) of the session, which was my favorite
session of the congress (Nuclear Power and Sustainable Development).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: the only talks that had real economists at the conference were the
first two of this&amp;nbsp;session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real gem came that evening. I was having dinner (Fondue &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
Epessess) with Erich and an economist professor (Erich&amp;#8217;s friend) from
Stanford. From what I gathered he has somewhat recently gone through a
less-than-pretty divorce. In any event, he said that he joined
eHarmony.com for the hell of it (aka lulz), confidence building, etc.
Nothing&amp;nbsp;serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plot thickens, much like the fondue. Then he comes out and says it.
With one of his friends back home, he set up a fake female account on
eHarmory to see if he could get matched with himself. And he finds it
funny to read the guys trying to proposition &amp;#8220;her&amp;#8221;. Yup. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://scopatz.livejournal.com/2008/04/13/"&gt;Sound like a
pair of Walkers,&amp;nbsp;perhaps?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being a group of scientists/engineers/economist, I got to watch my
adviser sit there and laugh at the idea and watch the two of them try to
pick apart the social networking scene. All in hilarious seriousness,
just like our age group does! It took every once of will not to 1) laugh
my ass off, and 2) talk about my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OKC&lt;/span&gt; experiences. Does my adviser
*really* need to know that I have a gay male cowboy alter-ego online?
If he is smart enough to read my blog he already&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I think I am safe since I had to explain to him last night that
MySpace is a sleazy den of pedophiles and whereas FaceBook is a
necessary&amp;nbsp;evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is about it for now. Not sure when I will have internet&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

Must be getting used to the&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been waking up at three in the morning and going to bed between 6
and 8 pm. This doesn&amp;#8217;t even vaugely match a Texan schedule and is an old
persons day over here. So far, what I can stay awake through of the
confrence is good. My paper is later today and hopefully people won&amp;#8217;t
ream it too badly. It has been a tough crowd so far (which is why I am
not giving the&amp;nbsp;talk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is still cold here. No longer zero it has at least hit double digits
(though most of the day is spent around 6). Yesterday it got warm enough
for me to take off my jacket in direct sunlight. Also, the clouds
managed to clear for the lunch hour (afterwhich it was more overcast
again). But I got some pictures while I had the&amp;nbsp;chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took a long walk yesterday around the outskirts of town. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/Interlaken#"&gt;Really
super pretty&lt;/a&gt;. It actually reminds me a lot of Sequoia and other high
alpine parts of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada. The landscape is
mostly (unfortunately newgrowth) conifer forest with patchwork meadows
throughout. Suprisigly to me, much of the geology is very similiar as
well. Many of the main structures are of granite/marble laced with
quartz seams. That which isn&amp;#8217;t, is made up of grey slate and shale. Sure
the relative concentrations are a bit off as compared to my homeland,
but it is quite astonding to see the same sort of diversity above and
below&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, as you would expect, bit me in the ass on the first day I was
here. I found a plant that looked like mint. So I decided to crinkle one
of the leaves so I could smell it. Needless to say it was not mint &lt;em&gt;at
all&lt;/em&gt;. Whatever was on the underside of that leaf was prickly as hell.
The micro-thorns ended up shaving of the first layer or two of skin on
my thumb. &lt;strong&gt;And it didn&amp;#8217;t even smell like anything!&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#8217;ll teach&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I forgot to mention that the internet connections suck here.
About $5 for a thirty minute connection and the free wireless at the
confrence is disgustingly unreliable. You&amp;#8217;d think that with 12 routers
you would be able to find one that works. But even if you get one with a
good signal stregth, 70% of the time it won&amp;#8217;t give you an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address. (I
think it has something to do with dedicating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; addresses to an ip,
which is fucked up at a confrence of this&amp;nbsp;size.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the town still has pre-Great War water fountains and a
Japaneese tea garden put in by its sister city Osua. Such are the
benefits of assumed neutrality. Screw the&amp;nbsp;Euro!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was smart I would have converted all of my liquid assests to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;
before coming over and then back to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; when I go back. Could have made
an easy 5% doing nothing this week. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIP&lt;/span&gt; Lehman, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIG&lt;/span&gt;. And stay dead this
time will&amp;nbsp;ya?!&lt;/p&gt;

The trip
out here was naturally not without its hiccups. I was about as depressed
as ever when I first got here. Here are the reasons for it that I can&amp;nbsp;tell,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The travel over here had us arrive in town before noon local time.
I then had to stay up until around 8 pm to get onto a normal schedule.
The 40+ hours of being awake does things to a&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Gundam access for a &lt;em&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; week! Just the thought has had me
in pangs. You know you are an addict&amp;nbsp;when&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not to diminish what is going on back home in Texas, but the
weather here has been awful. We got here on the first day of snow for
this season. Another data point proving I might have &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ethnic homogeneity of&amp;nbsp;Switzerland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short hair on&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My eyes are&amp;nbsp;blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that Disgaea was not on the above list. This is
because I have been fervently playing my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSP&lt;/span&gt; copy, which has sustained
me through many afternoons of&amp;nbsp;darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, the above reasons combine in interesting ways. Firstly, being
extremely tired and stressed out triggered my ever-present stomach
problems with always leaves me emotionally battered. Then on the train
from Zurich to Interlaken, I started thinking&amp;#8230;which is always a bad&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that on trains we were passing that the we were passing that
the 90+% of the people fit into one of the four ethnic Swiss groups,
which are all more or less white. Up to this point and afterward,
whenever Erich and I would go anywhere we would try to speak in German.
With Dr. Schneider, whose Deutsch is better than mine, others would
reply in German. Even though I always started in German, they never
failed to reply in&amp;nbsp;English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking. Both of our families left the old country at about
the same time. But Erich still looks Ethnically German (and thus
ethnically Swiss for the part of Switzerland we are in). I do not. I no
longer look like a native in part because my people were wiped out of
this region 60 years ago. Sure the Swiss weren&amp;#8217;t part of the Nazi
regime, but they were just a smidge more than complacent in it. I don&amp;#8217;t
know if other people have ever had this experience, but I felt very
uneasy for a while after I arrived. Not in a personal safety kind of
way, but I felt this overwhelming rejection of just everything. I was
ashamed I had ever even tried to learn&amp;nbsp;German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shake and bake this with Gundam and you get more reasons why Char is my
hero. Would you have joined the Axis military force in order to get
close to Hitler and kill him?&amp;nbsp;Probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, short hair on women is still classy in Europe. None of
them are making any kind of statement and they can&amp;#8217;t *all* be dykes.
Of die Frauen at the conference, I have only seen one woman with hair
below shoulder length. Only 40% have hair at or near shoulder length and
all the rest are even closer trimmed. Normally, one would think that
this would please me. Instead it made me question why I wasn&amp;#8217;t living
here (see above) and the ghola ratio is too high. Not that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t
tap 25% of them in a second. But I haven&amp;#8217;t.&amp;nbsp;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this has gotten me shook up enough for my eyes to have
transmigrated to blue. And for them to stay there. I tried to take a
picture, but shining a light in my eyes threw off the color balance and
they ended up looking green-gray in the picture&amp;nbsp;anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Holy Days are coming up. And you know what that&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/p&gt;

would spend hours getting lost in the flow of the links. Luckily Michael

as&amp;nbsp;addicting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less it goes through about every form of media (including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REAL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIFE&lt;/span&gt;) and links it to the tropes, cliches, plot devices that the piece
at hand utilizes. So it is more or less&amp;nbsp;amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be forewarned that is completely written by nerds of the &amp;#8220;New Media
Studies&amp;#8221; variety. So if you don&amp;#8217;t get the humor I apologize. This also
means that while they may have listed every anime known to man, they
have probably left out your favorite silent film. In any event, it is&amp;nbsp;hilarious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with such a proliferation of tropes, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt"&gt;including ones that are older

But since
then, I have been too busy with real work to actually post&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;/Linux user and computational scientist, I spend &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of time
looking at computer screens. So a while ago I decided to do the
transparent terminal thing, so I could see my background while I code.
Keep things spicy rather than looking at white-on-black &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people (sub-human kernel hackers, really) choose their backgrounds
as either softcore porn, or softcore hentai if they are *really*
nerdy. However these pictures tend to be flashy and interfere with you
being actually able to read the text. So these people (see above) have
to actually decrease the overall&amp;nbsp;transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go with simple, mostly black backgrounds. And I require that the color
scheme in the picture *does not* interfere with the default terminal
color scheme (Yeah&amp;nbsp;Gentoo!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This more or less means that I have to make my own backgrounds since it
is impossible to find pre-generated images that satisfy my needs. I
still go with the traditional anime theme, though not quite as&amp;nbsp;slutty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous background from last year was for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTO&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/RandomPicturesOfMe#5244462517993079314"&gt;My new background is
of a new type of&amp;nbsp;hero.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there was such a cacophony against what I wrote about &amp;#8220;Watchmen&amp;#8221;
and most of it echoed each other, I have started this thread as a
general response. You know rather than repeating myself&amp;nbsp;^_^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok So let me clarify again. I did like it. I really did. However,
everyone I ever talked to before reading seemed to say that it was a 9
or a 10. I didn&amp;#8217;t think so. I would put it more at a 7 or an 8. And that
is all I was trying to get across and gave my reasons why I would place
it lower than most&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Publishing date and temporal relativism:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I understand that
&amp;#8220;Watchmen&amp;#8221; came out before Cthulu was &amp;#8216;cool&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;overused&amp;#8217;. I knew this
while reading it, which is why I more or less give it a pass on this
front. I didn&amp;#8217;t mention this originally so much as a criticism as much
as a personal taste&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only having a 20 year shelf life for me is incredibly short compared to
the rest of the works on my bookshelf (off by a couple of orders of
magnitude). Which is why *I* would rate it lower than your normal
human being. Tolkien only had about 50 years. And who knows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRRM&lt;/span&gt; could
have even less. But I am prepared to judge books by future standards
when that time&amp;nbsp;comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are other Sci-Fi/Fantasy works that at this time still seem to
be fairly transcendent of time. Sure Asimov was only expanding on
classical themes (Golem, etc). Okay, Herbert achieved his different
voices mostly through insane perturbations of obscure words. Both of
these authors worked before &amp;#8220;Watchmen&amp;#8221; and retain their&amp;nbsp;presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Hitting/Missing:&lt;/strong&gt; Actually, I am pretty sure I didn&amp;#8217;t miss the
point. I got it &lt;em&gt;and I liked it.&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;#8217;t really talk about the
postmodern elements in my original post because I thought that this was
one of the larger marks in its favor. I really wanted that post to be
about what I didn&amp;#8217;t like, and specifically how the voice thing bothered
me so much (since this seems unique, and therefore&amp;nbsp;interesting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now that you bring it up, I loved it. Specifically, the stuff with
the privateer comic-in-the-comic stuff was amazing. Reading those
sections provided me with a multitasking challenge that I found
difficult at 4&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that the characters are supposed to represent other more well
known characters is sort of a given in order for the author to make the
points and commentaries he wants to&amp;nbsp;make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Blah! I need to start editing again. I have a lot of thoughts on
modernism, post-modernism, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtWSlAi1uJg"&gt;post-post-modernism&lt;/a&gt;. But I guess it
has got to&amp;nbsp;wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt; the tag for the original post was an in joke to the people in
Austin. So don&amp;#8217;t be confused by&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

My paper that is. I am
really just editing now&amp;#8230;the annoying part. I finished the graphic
novel &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen"&gt;&amp;#8220;Watchmen&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;As always, I need to start off with some disclaimers:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1) &lt;strong&gt;There will be spoilers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2) I *really* did enjoy the ride.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;3) The back cover calls the work &amp;#8220;Peerless&amp;#8221;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I liked it and felt compelled to keep reading. In that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCD&lt;/span&gt;
kinda way. There were some things that they did very very right in this
comic. The first of these, which is awesome, is that Rorschach&amp;#8217;s face
changes in each panel. Secondly, the gimmick of having plain-text
portions at the end of each chapter that give in character background
information is&amp;nbsp;brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this gimmick actually turns out to be one of my larger
criticisms against &amp;#8220;Watchmen&amp;#8221;. The story involves a decent number of
characters from rather distinct backgrounds. So maybe I have gone soft
via &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRRM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I now expect different characters to have different
voices. This means that the author has to take on a different writing
style to accommodate the character that is speaking. Normally, this
isn&amp;#8217;t a problem with comics because the voices are all flat and you are
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STARING&lt;/span&gt; at the character talking. But there were really only 5 voices 1)
Rorschach, 2) Walter Kovacs, 3) Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, 4) the
newspaper man (generic Brooklyn stereotype), 5) and everyone&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My basic point is that Hollis shouldn&amp;#8217;t sound Dan Dreiberg who shouldn&amp;#8217;t
sound like Sally Jupiter who shouldn&amp;#8217;t sound like the Comedian, etc.
This really limited my ability to suspend my disbelief, because it was
no longer the characters speaking, but rather the author talking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; me.
I was starting to see this but the real clincher is that plain-text
gimmick at the end of every chapter. The first couple are by Hollis
Mason (retired Nite Owl #1) and the third is by Dr. Manhattan. They are
written in the same style. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOOOO&lt;/span&gt;. They comic continually tries to make
the case that Dr. Manhattan is now no longer quite human. He really
shouldn&amp;#8217;t be sharing the same speech patterns with the&amp;nbsp;psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing about Dr. Manhattan is that by his own admission there
is no reason to be&amp;nbsp;blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did like that the bad guy won, and that the bad guy was a good guy
acting with the best of intentions (even if he stood to make a profit
off of it). I also like that Veidt won over Dr. Manhattan to his evil
scheme with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOGIC&lt;/span&gt;. But then Dr. Manhattan admits that even if Rorschach
were to make it back to civilization that no one would take him
seriously as he is a criminal and monkey-off-of-his-nuts crazy. However,
that Dr. Manhattan then goes and kills Rorschach unceremoniously, out of
hand really bothers me. This does not follow&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOGIC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some cute devices like Robert Redford (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RR&lt;/span&gt;, totally not Ronald
Reagan) running for president. But for everyone of these there was a
laborious passage by Dreiberg (or, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUTHOR&lt;/span&gt;) talking about Art thinly
disguised as&amp;nbsp;ornithology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I am fine with the leveling of New York as a plot device. But
c&amp;#8217;mon, did it really need to be Cthulhu? After all that, we get to some
inter-dimensional, squid-monster, Elder-being, unknowable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;H.P.&lt;/span&gt; Lovecraft
fan&amp;nbsp;service?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, Watchmen was cool. It was fun. But it certainly wasn&amp;#8217;t
because it was without&amp;nbsp;peer.&lt;/p&gt;

But I needed the time to
cool off and put someone&amp;#8217;s head on my&amp;nbsp;shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;#8217;s life is always a probability tree. Mine is more so now than
it has been since I have moved to Austin. What follows is a qualitative
diagram what *may* happen. I am neglecting to put numbers down,
because frankly it is too woeful to think&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1) I pass the quals when I retake them in January.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;___A) I stay at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UT&lt;/span&gt; until I get my PhD.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2) I fail the quals in January.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;___A) Under the departmental rules I am therefore kicked out of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UT&lt;/span&gt; and out of a job.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;______i) I must find something else to do. Though my parents have offered to float me for a time, I am unsure if this is responsibleon my part&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;_________a) Get a crap job to make ends meet somewhere around Austin.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;_________b) Find a &amp;#8220;career&amp;#8221;-esque job. This may or may not take me away from Austin (hopefully &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;) and may or may not take me to California (if I have to go somewhere :shrug:) and may or may not be at a national lab (please &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;!!!).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;_________c) Study for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSAT&lt;/span&gt; and go to law school. I still haven&amp;#8217;t married a lawyer, so law school is still on the table ^_^.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;_________d) Go to grad school at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UT&lt;/span&gt; elsewhere but almost certainly in another field. I have forsaken Physics (discovered that the emotional block seems to be permanent). So I would likely switch to comp-sci or comp-engineering or something. But we shouldn&amp;#8217;t overlook the possibility that I am simply not cut out to be an academic. I have had this creeping fear for a while.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;___B) There *might* (so Josh tells me) exist a provision by which students whom have failed the qualifier twice but the professors believe actually know the material are allowed to take the test a third and last time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;______i) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOTO&lt;/span&gt; 1.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeya in February where ever I am. If you are reading this and assuming
that it isn&amp;#8217;t that bad and I that I am blowing things out of scale, let
me assure you that it is that bad. Somehow I thought that taking the
hard way would be&amp;nbsp;easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; I have beaten Dynasty Warriors: Gundam. Needless to say, it was
amazing&amp;#8230;.just like Disgaea 3&amp;nbsp;=).&lt;/p&gt;

Bit by bit, I move along. But I
have learned at least one&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My option-space for partners is a lot larger in California than it is in
Texas. I am not quite sure why this is, but I do know how I feel about
it. Somewhat disappointed. This is one of those very few things that I
am more or less upset that I live in Texas. I wanna have my pie and eat
it too. While it is nice to know that you *could* have a date,
consistently being told no because of 1500+ miles is a little
frustrating. Granted it has been a while since I have even wanted to
play the field. Now that I am again, I have been as successful as I
could reasonably&amp;nbsp;achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the deal with&amp;nbsp;Tejas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well near as I can tell there are a few things. The first is that I lost
a lot of weight while I have been out in Austin. This means the out in
California, people compare me to their memory of me. So I am competing
with myself and doing really well! However, in Texas and among people I
have not previously known I am still competing with the rest of the
world in terms of appearance. Tough&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the community (or communities) in California allow for the
rekindling of old flames and the introduction to a variety of new
people. Of course, this plays off a lifelong history of generating and
keeping friends in a collection of places. Not only by myself, but also
by my friends. I have only been in Texas a couple of years &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; the
community doesn&amp;#8217;t really support this&amp;nbsp;behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly and obviously, there is school. While in Texas I am quite focused
on my studies. And I tend to be rather worked and tried a good portion
of the time. Then all of my big blocks of free time I spend out of
state. More or less then very little of my socializing is spent in
Austin trying to play the local field. I am just too busy and otherwise&amp;nbsp;occupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have solutions to all of these points. But that is another
post. If you take nothing else from this, understand that I am now back
in business. The closed sign has been flipped to open. Renovations are
mostly&amp;nbsp;complete.&lt;/p&gt;

This one was a&amp;nbsp;deeewwsy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this last trip was super intense. I will try to separate the cream
from the other butter&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the seeing peeps in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; (Meenon, Jessica Simpson, and other enigmatic folk) I went to San Diego (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;) for the big summer family&amp;nbsp;vacation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First day I went to the optical engineering conference &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPIE&lt;/span&gt; with my&amp;nbsp;dad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next day I went to Tijuana with the&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third day, we left &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; and went to Ramona to visit my Great Uncle Kurt. Ended up in Escondido that&amp;nbsp;evening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday we went to the San Diego Wild Animal&amp;nbsp;Park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last day Monday, we went to the Original Pancake House in Vista and then the Atlantian-themed&amp;nbsp;Fry&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cream:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before actually meeting up with my family, I went to visit Kerry Deuce. It has been a while since I have seen her and we hung out and exchanged stories for a few hours. Turns out that my Kerry collection will soon all be living in the City. Makes it more convenient for future visits ^_^. Made it through with zero (0) references to Dune.&amp;nbsp;Awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Wild animal park was amazing! You really should&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPIE&lt;/span&gt; conference with my dad reminded me of all of my
ole Physics days. Moreover, it got me thinking about laser isotope&amp;nbsp;enrichment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was sooooo good to see my great uncle again. This subject gets a
little political depending on who you talk to. We will suffice it to say
he is the last living Holocaust survivor in the&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watched some Olympics. More or less we pwn basketball on both mens &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; womens. And Jamaicans are short distance Kenyans&amp;nbsp;^_^.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Birthday,&amp;nbsp;duh!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Butter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While we were in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; proper, all 6 of us were crammed into this
*maybe* 500 sqft hotel room. It was&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of my brothers was just awful this trip. He was complaining
and morose the whoooooole time. He didn&amp;#8217;t want to come so much that he
bothered my parents until they gave in. For various reasons he came&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, he failed to behave on the trip. This made my mom
incredibly jumpy. This lead to my father and I and eventually my other
brother getting in immense amount of trouble over the smallest little&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For instance, I got in trouble for saying &amp;#8220;Mornin&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; as a response
to &amp;#8220;Good Morning&amp;#8221; to my mom. Since I left out the word good I clearly
didn&amp;#8217;t care about her feelings, the family,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My mother forced us to cut the trip short, which is when we left
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;. However, people kind of made up and we ended up staying an extra&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During all of this, I backed into a parked car when pulling out of
a parking&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the last day, it came out that said brother had brought a
switchblade. At least he &amp;#8220;wasn&amp;#8217;t planning on hurting anyone else&amp;#8221; on the&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So don&amp;#8217;t take my word for it, try it for&amp;nbsp;yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night, Meenon and Jessica Simpson (still hilarious) had some good
things to say about Enigmas to me. Without getting into it, balance of
interest and honesty at the early stages of a non-relationship is
something that they have a unique perspective on (among my&amp;nbsp;friends).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning+, Meenon and I went lingerie shopping (for her, not me
though I did see some fun stuff). We in fact went to Fredrick&amp;#8217;s of
Hollywood &lt;strong&gt;*in Hollywood!*&lt;/strong&gt; It was fun and helped with a costume idea
about gloves. We had pizza for&amp;nbsp;lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly we went to this fairly famous (though the name
escapes me) film bookstore in Hollywood. They also happen to have a
bunch of movie stills and posters. Unfortunately, they did not have a
poster of &amp;#8220;Her Wild Oat&amp;#8221;. However, they did have a bunch of Coleen Moore
stills. I ended up buying five (5) of them&amp;nbsp;^_^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I drove down to San Diego in the afternoon. I met up with
Kerry Deuce for dinner and then we hung out for a few hours. It was a
good time. Now I am here in the hotel in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; with my&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/p&gt;

I
guess I didn&amp;#8217;t realize true emotional/mental/spiritual effort that goes
into&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had approached them originally like a coin. You don&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; know
how they are going to respond, so you may a well flip and be done with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this only really representative of the situation on the ground
before the toss. It turns out Enigma girls are more like
event/probability trees, like a sport&amp;#8217;s division playoff roster. There
are a bunch of options, contingencies and&amp;nbsp;paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there are a million pathways to &amp;#8220;No&amp;#8221;. A relatively few
number that are successful. And still a small number that manage to
maintain (more or less) the status&amp;nbsp;quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even playing a perfect game does not guarantee a &amp;#8220;Yes&amp;#8221;. Other players
could have closed these paths down long&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what then are these Enigma girls? They are coins whose one face is a
flat negative and whose positive side is a tree. But the forest is dark
and finding the right set of branches could leave you hanging for a
couple of years, waiting for new&amp;nbsp;growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I content to hang? Yes, though I might braciate elsewhere. Like to Texas.
Am I sad? No, even though the it was understood that this contingency
was the most likely, it is still disappointing hear it. However, I am a
bit proud that I made it this far. Lesser men and women have fallen&amp;nbsp;^_^.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You enigma girls are truly my betters. Friends until the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have long known that my social engineering (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SE&lt;/span&gt;) skills were honed and
sharpened here. However, it may turn out that this is precisely the
place where I attended &amp;#8220;ninja training camp&amp;#8221;, as it&amp;nbsp;were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I noticed this trip is that nigh on everyone in this friend group
engages in it, and they more or less acknowledge it. Furthermore, they
all approach it with the mindset (that I do, that I likely learned from
them) that it &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt; interpersonal manipulation, but rather a
survival mechanism. This is simply how the &amp;#8220;game&amp;#8221; is played, so one may
as well play it. It is how these people communicate with each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok wonderful. There is this subculture that is stable and functions in
this way with most of its members. Yet there seem to be a couple of
salient features that I just noticed that should be&amp;nbsp;discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) When you remove people who think and act like this from this
subculture and put them in a group of people that doesn&amp;#8217;t communicate
like this, then fun times happen. First off, the social engineer doesn&amp;#8217;t
change what their actions. However, they do feel compelled to not be so
explicit in what is going on in their brain, since the new group of
people is likely predisposed against&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this doesn&amp;#8217;t stop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SE&lt;/span&gt; from behaving as such. Thus our hero
will more or less be able to construct the social situations they
desire, because no one is expecting them to do so. Of course there will
be one or two people in the new group who think along the same lines,
but they likely haven&amp;#8217;t had the practice honing their skill since they
weren&amp;#8217;t living in a pure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Secondly, when living in a pure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SE&lt;/span&gt; environment everyone develops not
only the external communication and information gathering tools, but
also a deep set of inner personal skills. This is to say that even
though they can mine the minds of others with some competence, they also
by necessity develop a hardy bulwark of defenses. These evasive
maneuvers themselves may become a separate skill set that can be&amp;nbsp;perfected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, when someone has a better defensive block to you than you have
data mining abilities on them, they effectively become an enigma to you.
Their emotional state is hard to read. Predictions about what they will
do in a given situation all come out a&amp;nbsp;wash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From personal experience, I have found that just because you have
information does not mean you can perform any positive acts with it. I
am sure that it is partially because of this that I feel that the Enigma
people from above are super&amp;nbsp;hawt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do they have the &amp;#8220;tough nut to crack&amp;#8221; thing going, but that
lack of information might be occasionally beneficial. Moreover, it is
not that there is no communication occurring, as with most dysfunctional
relationships with a lack of info situation. Both the Enigma and me keep
mining each other. It is simply that discovery of true feelings can be
stalled during those notoriously bad wishy-washy&amp;nbsp;moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So aside from other things physical and mental, girls who are Enigmas
definitely get super-marks in my book. Love ya&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/scopatz/3R3BBackpacking2008"&gt;Just got back from the annual three Scopatz brother&amp;#8217;s backpacking trip
in Sequoia National park.&lt;/a&gt; This year we did the Twin Lakes Trail. I
decided on this trail because last year we did the Alta and Lakes
Trails. These other two go up the one side of Tokopah Valley and the
Twin Lakes Trail goes up the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trail was intense! It was seven miles of a relentless uphill climb
(~2500 ft). The Alta Trail and the Twin Lakes Trail have point where
after a good rise, you walk downhill for a bit. Oh ho, not so here! All
up all the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lakes themselves were pretty; but we had to cut our planned 4 day/3
night excursion one day and night short due to concerns over rain and a
lack of proper gear to handle&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day was spent getting up to the Twin Lakes. The second day we
took day hike to Lost Lake in Sequoia National Forest, because now
unlike its moniker we have found it. Lost Lake was 5 miles away and
required a thousand foot climb to Silliman Pass and then a 2000 foot
decent into the valley on the other side. Of course this was reversed on
the return&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third day was supposed to be a grueling 20 mile long loop. However,
the day before while coming back home over the Silliman gap we saw and
heard and felt a thunderstorm. Luckily, this stayed on *that* side of
the ridge and didn&amp;#8217;t rain on us that night. A group that came back over
a couple hours later actually got fully caught in the storm on their way
out. A ranger told us that there was a 30% rain chance for the next day.
Furthermore, by the morning of the third day, the winds had shifted.
What was a warm front (being in the 70s at night at 9500 ft) had turned
into a a very cold air mass. Taking this as a sign of trouble to come,
we cut our losses and, better safe than sorry, headed down the&amp;nbsp;mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was disappointing that we had to call the trip early, but Shane&amp;#8217;s and
Julian&amp;#8217;s rain gear consisted of one black plastic bag each. Oh well, we
will know for next year to get some serious rain gear for everyone in
the&amp;nbsp;party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I am looking forward to next year! It is looking
increasingly likely that we will end up in Mineral King. Should be&amp;nbsp;fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 &amp;#8212; Last Saturday I was up in Three Rivers (3R) with everyone. That
morning I needed some supplies so I went out to Village Market. I needed
some Pop Tarts for breakfast. They also amazingly had butterscotch
schnapps, so I picked some up. (I knew people had brought Baileys and/or
Emmets; Buttery Nipples were &amp;#8220;emme&amp;#8221;-nant.) Then, my stomach was feeling
bad so I got some Mylanta. Right above the Mylanta were the condoms.
Thinking it would be funny I picked these up too. Hence, I walked up to
the counter laid down my Pop Tarts, my booze, my Mylanta, and my
condoms, shrugged, smiled, and said &amp;#8220;It is just one of those days&amp;nbsp;^_~.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 &amp;#8212; So I have had these weird growths on my hands for a while now. I
self-diagnosed them as common warts. But I tried freezing them off
multiple times. When this didn&amp;#8217;t work, I thought they weren&amp;#8217;t. Thus I
went to the dermatologist the other day. &lt;strong&gt;*She gave me a yeast
infection.*&lt;/strong&gt; No joke! She actually injected the aforementioned areas
with yeast infection protein. It turns out they are warts. The yeast
infection protein tricks your body into attacking the area. While there,
your immune system finds the warts and then tries to destroy them too.
Very sneaky. &lt;strong&gt;*She gave me a yeast infection Three (3)&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIMES&lt;/span&gt;!*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 &amp;#8212; I am watching this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; series that I am renting the discs from
Netflix. I finished disc 5 and because of some haranguing I had all of
my discs in at once. But for whatever reason, they decided to send me
disc 6 from Butte, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MO&lt;/span&gt;. However, they sent me discs 7 &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; 8 from like 60
miles away. Now they all left the same day which means I am sitting here
debating whether to skip a disc or not. But this all begs the question,
&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NETFLIX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAVE&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DISTRIBUTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CENTER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUTTE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MO&lt;/span&gt;?&amp;#8221; Nothing is
close to Butte but Butte. This can&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;economical&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

land of my birth and some parts of California are among the most
beautiful I have ever seen. That being said, Flame&amp;nbsp;On!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having driven all around this country I have noticed an interesting
trend about personal/external aesthetics. It seems that the uglier the
place is, the more the general populous living there cares about
personal appearance. Conversely, the more gorgeous a local is perceived
to intrinsically be, the less the residents take care of their body.
Naturally this is broad and may have some anomalous&amp;nbsp;bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Southern and Northern California may have at time had some
natural beauty, the Bay Area and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; have been paved and scarred for
generations now. Nature has been more absconded here than in almost any
other location in the country (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; maybe worse, I have never been). In
other words the populated parts of California rank among my least
favorite places to exist in. These parts of the west coast are
disgusting and&amp;nbsp;overgrown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why then are they also home to per capita the hottest, sexiest, fittest
people in the country. Additionally, the degrees of these variables are
much more varied than from Arizona to&amp;nbsp;Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;#8217;t be that *all* of the beautiful people somehow flock to the
coasts once they are of age. Many of the people I know or have met that
I put a cut above the standard populous were born here or have lived in
California since they were small&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I am lead to think that is something more subtle and
insidious. I am going to go out on a limb and suggest that people who
grow up in such a man-made environment internalize this non-nature.
Since beauty is not being provided to them in their everyday,
aestheticism is taught to be built up from the&amp;nbsp;inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest thing to alter is outward appearance. Hence, beauty is not
obtained by going for a hike or by appreciating birds. Beauty is found
by making oneself beautiful. Everyone wins,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not if you want it all&amp;nbsp;^_~&lt;/p&gt;

summer, the big hit right now is Katy Perry&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;I Kissed a Girl (and I
Liked&amp;nbsp;It)&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every summer, there is one pop song that both tops the charts and I find
guiltily irresistible. Last year it was Rhianna&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Umbrella&amp;#8221;; two years
ago it was Gnarls Barkley&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Crazy&amp;#8221;. This year it is definitely &amp;#8220;I
Kissed a&amp;nbsp;Girl&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This song is especially interesting since it really throws the
gender-bending norms right in ones face. On the surface, the lyrics are
about a young, straight-defined woman who is experimenting with other
women. Given that women&amp;#8217;s sexuality seems to be more fluid than men and
that girl on girl kissing is rather commonplace, the song doesn&amp;#8217;t really
seem to be breaking any huge molds here. However, Ms. Perry makes her
sexuality a bit more explicit with lines like &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t even know your
name/It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter.&amp;#8221; Indicating that her homo-desires are raw and&amp;nbsp;explicit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the lyrics are only one side of the gender-bending of this
song. The actual orchestration I can only describe as a confusion of
Pop/Techno and traditional Hair Metal. The latter is particularly
interesting since this was primarily the domain of men of the
stroke-my-enormous-cock-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMG&lt;/span&gt;-I-am-a-rock-star variety. Otherwise, the
song is well within the &amp;#8220;Look at me I am breaking boundaries&amp;#8221; domain.
This type typically bores me since the boundaries (which is true here)
have been broken since the dawn of girls mackin&amp;#8217; with other&amp;nbsp;chix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However via &lt;a class="reference external" href="void(0);/*1217397454397*/"&gt;Coverville&lt;/a&gt;, I found out about &lt;a class="reference external" href="void(0);/*1217397517764*/"&gt;Max Vernon&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; amazing&amp;nbsp;cover!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be tempted to then say, &amp;#8220;Haha, knock-up job mate! Now
everything is all heteronormative now again!&amp;#8221; But I assure you that this
is about as far from the truth as can&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max changes almost none of the words. Thus the lines that go &amp;#8220;I kissed a
girl/Hope my boyfriend don&amp;#8217;t mind it&amp;#8221; take on a even more distinctly
homosexual twist. With Katy Perry&amp;#8217;s version, there is a girl having a
first lesbian encounter, where as with Max there is a boy having his
first straight&amp;nbsp;encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Max also changes the instrumentation significantly. Where
Katy was using male-oriented methods to really drive her gender play
home, Mr. Vernon does the same thing. Max&amp;#8217;s take on the song make you
think it is a piano solo for the first have. When more players come in,
they are much lower in intensity than the original. One might even
describe his version as the more&amp;nbsp;feminine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, both songs are sexy and amazing. I strongly encourage a&amp;nbsp;sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

backlog of three (3) posts that need to be made. Expect them to appear
in quick&amp;nbsp;succession.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every weekend just seems to get a bit crazier. This one was certainly
more action packed than last weekend. This is saying a lot since it has
been historically difficult to top Meenon&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here goes a summary of my amazing&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got up to Three Rivers (3R) on friday night at about 7 pm. Went out for dinner and by the time got back Carly and Andrew 3 had&amp;nbsp;arrived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We waited around for hours and Andrew 1, Caitlin, Garret and Shannon finally showed up at 3&amp;nbsp;am!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next morning I wake up at 10 and everyone else at about noon. We mobilize and get to the&amp;nbsp;park.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Road construction in Sequoia has been blessfully ceased, so the ride up was easy. Listened to The Protomen on the drive up to Giant&amp;nbsp;Forest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did the Bear Hill trail from the museum over to Moro Rock. Then we
went on the Sugar Pine trail from Moro Rock to Crescent Meadow. I had
never done the second one. That&amp;#8217;s Amazing! Endearing,&amp;nbsp;really.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drove down the mountain. A couple of hours later Shanon and Caitlin
and I went out to pick up some&amp;nbsp;pizza.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tada! Josh and Rachel showed up! Totally unexpected to me. It was
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOOO&lt;/span&gt;(O)^\infty good to see them again. I am very glad they could make
it. (unfortunate that Mowi was feeling sick&amp;nbsp;though).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After dinner, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt; started. I played Caith, and it was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMAZING&lt;/span&gt;.
I built Caith as a non-com, so the suckage that occurred in D&amp;amp;D was
inversely proportional to the rockage in an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RP&lt;/span&gt; dinner party&amp;nbsp;setting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In game and out, a good number of us got drunk on Absinthe.
Eventually, *someone* ::winkwink:: started doing straight shots and I
was obliged to follow. My description of the rest of the evening will
have to be left to your&amp;nbsp;imaginations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recovering and detoxifying, people lazily got up and packed the
next&amp;nbsp;morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel and Josh&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of us then went to Reimers (locally made candy and ice
cream shop). Then everyone left for&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only made it to Visalia. I was supposed to go to Sean&amp;#8217;s that day
but it was already like 6 pm, so I decided to call. He didn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;answer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ate and went back to 3R for the&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The next day I call couldn&amp;#8217;t get a hold of Sean, so I resign
myself to going back to the Beautiful, Yet Dumb, Santa Ynez&amp;nbsp;Vally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within 5 minutes of being home, Christen calls. Within an hour,
Sean&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary I had a great time. It was wonderful to be able to hike
around and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RP&lt;/span&gt; with people I like &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; love. In fact, everyone that went I
ended up feeling like I love and respect more than before. And everyone
who didn&amp;#8217;t go, I already love &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; respect&amp;nbsp;~_~.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus Sincerely, Fuck You 21st Birthday&amp;nbsp;Party!~!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you guys so much, but there is just no way I will ever be as
funny as you. You are the people that I feel so much less funny around
because you are just that hilarious. All I can do is set up jokes for
you. I am glad to do this because you keep me in stitches the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHOLE&lt;/span&gt; time
I am around you. It is such a wonderful feeling to be in the everlasting
presence of your one-liners. I understand that it is half about timing
and half what you actually say, but that kind of comedic talent is not
present in all of us. For what it is worth, I would sleep with you for
your&amp;nbsp;puns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you haven&amp;#8217;t realized it by now Ryan, you don&amp;#8217;t need to be named
Ryan. You *could* be called Malcolm X, or Jessica&amp;nbsp;Simpson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This weekend seemed to exemplify my shortcomings:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;-I don&amp;#8217;t look like the fittest guy in the room.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are a bit hectic since my mom did pick up Fraggle at the Reno
Shelter. The new dog is super hyper even at a year old. Also, only my
mother and I seem to think adopting Fraggle was a reasonable idea.
Everyone else is disproving. But they more or less were against Jo Jo,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So last night and this morning were spent building a 10&amp;#8217;x10&amp;#8217;x6&amp;#8217; Dog
Kennel/Run so my mom can at least theoretically get away from this mutt
from time to&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels to be good to be back &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221;. Hangin&amp;#8217; out with my brothers
doing real house work. We then ran to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YMCA&lt;/span&gt; and worked out and played
basketball this&amp;nbsp;afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from seeing family, the highlight of my return is that I got the

So the San Fransisco Silent Film Festival was this last
weekend. I saw three films this time and this is more or less what I
thought of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) &amp;#8220;The Man Who Laughs&amp;#8221;: This film was the direct inspiration for the
Joker villain in the Batman comics. My least favorite of the festival,
it was also the headliner. The film had a strong narrative and plot but
almost no point o moral. It is based off of Victor Hugo novel and
features a love quadrangle between two carnies (one blind girl and one
man disfigured to that it always looks like he is laughing) and two
nobles (a duchess and a prince). I more or less waited around for all of
these four to die and then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NONE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THEM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COURTESY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt;! Three side
characters did, but really only the one in the iron maiden was
satisfying. The film had some really excellent shot angles and fades.
More or less I appreciated the technical aspects but the gimmick the
misunderstood laughing man was over pretty&amp;nbsp;quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &amp;#8220;Her Wild Oat&amp;#8221;: It is official: I am in love with Colleen Moore. This
film was far and wide my favorite. As was pointed out, the plot was your
standard Romantic Comedy Formula. Poor, normal working girl (Ms. Moore)
falls for rich wall street man who was dressed as a day laborer.
Hilarity ensues as they court each other in high and low society.
However, as was also noted, because of the films age, this tired old
format seemed somehow fresher and more genuine. Of course there were
comedic differences you have a hard time getting through nowadays. For
instance, there was a ton of slapstick as compared to modern films.
Moreover, the inter-titles had a group of hilarious puns,&amp;nbsp;eg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;She is a cabaret dancer at the Owl Club. One of those &amp;#8216;Iowa&amp;#8217; gals. As
in, &amp;#8216;Iowa months rent,&amp;nbsp;Daddy&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect though, the films was eerily similar to &amp;#8220;Wall-E&amp;#8221;. The
male/female gender roles were switched, but the basic plot and humor
styles were the same. Perhaps, true art *does* transcend time. But
something that really does speak through the ages is the mega-hottness
of Colleen Moore. If only she hadn&amp;#8217;t died when I was three and a&amp;nbsp;half&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &amp;#8220;Jujiro&amp;#8221;: This is a rather famous Japanese silent film by the same
director of &amp;#8220;A Page of Madness&amp;#8221;. Plot revolves around a very strong
female character and her no good brother who keeps getting himself into
trouble after he fell in love with a prostitute. It combined traditional
Japanese themes (honor, rain, death) with some pretty intense
surrealism. My favorite shot in the film is very very similar to one of
my favorite shots in Dziga Vertov&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Man with a Movie Camera&amp;#8221;. Here
there was a woman&amp;#8217;s (the prostitute) laughing head imposed over a
spinning pinwheel. A year later Vertov imposed a spinning industrial
sewing machine over the head of a laughing peasant woman. Either way it
is creepy and enticing. On the surface, combing strong Japanese tropes
with surrealism reminds modern viewers of &amp;#8220;Tetsuo: the Iron Man.&amp;#8221; This
might be a slightly unfair comparison, but they are alike in
awesomeness. &amp;#8220;Jujiro&amp;#8221; had a strong narrative structure more similar to
Kurosawa than the wacky &amp;#8220;Akira&amp;#8221;-inspired&amp;nbsp;film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, nothing was quite as good as the &amp;#8220;Godless Girl&amp;#8221; from last
year. But &amp;#8220;Her Wild Oat&amp;#8221; was certainly as good or better than &amp;#8220;Girl with
a Hat Box&amp;#8221; from the year before. Moreover, I am &amp;#8220;inspired&amp;#8221; to go out and
watch more Colleen Moore&amp;nbsp;films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a corollary, the more I go the more I am convinced that the format of
the silent film festival is something that would be perfect for Austin.
Both culturally and socially, someone should start this.&amp;nbsp;Hmmm&amp;#8230;..&lt;/p&gt;

Utah, and&amp;nbsp;Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three were boring as sin. I did get to see the sun set as I
rounded the Great Salt Lake. The firmament was especially beautiful. I
ended up in Wendover, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NV&lt;/span&gt; because I&amp;#8217;ll be damned if I spend the night in
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLC&lt;/span&gt; without having to. Although, to it&amp;#8217;s credit, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLC&lt;/span&gt; is the bastion of
civilization in the region despite its proximity to Idaho. I even saw
two hawt gawth chix walking down the street. And one was a redhead to
boot! There is hope&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ended my 1k+ trek for the day on the border, having gone more or
less through two whole time zones. But I tell you that Wendover must
also be some sort of backwater. I stayed at the Nugget Hotel &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Casino
and it did not have&amp;nbsp;internet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Wireless. No Ethernet. Nada. Nothing. Zilch.&amp;nbsp;Zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent a few days in Iowa with my relatives and a couple of
tireless days on the road to get there, I was more than a bit horny when
I pulled into Nevada. In the need for some virtual action, the lack of a
jack posed a problem. So I took the leap of a desperate man: Hotel&amp;nbsp;Porn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was presently surprised. Historically, hotel pornography has long been
the domain of thoughtless, vanilla, softcore fare. Old pornstars and
directors fear the day when they are relegated to this uninteresting&amp;nbsp;fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While still very tame as compared to the teeming mass of specialty
fetish site you can find online, there was a good amount of variety and
most of it was hardcore (not just women massaging their own breasts).
They even had some porn directed to straight women, and some other
specifically made for lesbians. Unfortunately, the closest thing to gay
male porn they got was the bisexual stuff [mmf] (gotta be a pussy
*somewhere* on&amp;nbsp;screen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may now be asking yourself why I am telling you about my all too
expensive &amp;#8220;me&amp;#8221; time. Well, because I found out the name for one of my
fetishes! For a long time I had been thinking of it in terms of only
length, and that is why I was calling it &amp;#8220;my short-hair fetish&amp;#8221;. It
turns out this goes by, at least in Wendover, the term&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Tomboy&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loving lesbians and butch bisexuals is more or less a losing bargain. So
on a tactical level it is advantageous to try to be attracted to the
people that might have more than an inkling of mutual feelings. But try
as I might, I just can&amp;#8217;t bring myself to think of the traditional
straight woman visage as fundamentally sexy (and not just because it is
&amp;#8220;too normal&amp;#8221;, you&amp;nbsp;jerks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having found the correct terminology, I am certain my future internet
queries will be more bountiful in results. Now if I could find the
tomboy into&amp;nbsp;suspension&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;-Leave &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IA&lt;/span&gt; on Wednesday morning, end up somewhere in those nebulous inner states.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;-Thursday continue onto Reno. Meet up with my Mom here for the night.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;-Friday hang with my Mom until I go the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;-Friday Night to Sunday Morning be in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SF&lt;/span&gt;/Daly City.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film in the first 20 minutes does some serious Silent Film
channeling. Portions are even slapstick. Very interesting to see this
emerge. What is perhaps more intriguing is that these same opening bits
were also quite cyber-punk. I almost wanted to burst out in song (&amp;#8220;These
Are A Few of My Favorite&amp;nbsp;Things&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less, the Earth&amp;#8217;s surface had been destroyed through pollution
and all that remained were the left over trash. Even the movies premise,
that a lone sentient being (Wall-E itself) is left to fend for
sustenance on society&amp;#8217;s discarded scraps, serves to reinforce this
cyber-punk theme. The sky and ground are the same diseased yellow-brown.
It is all soul crushingly&amp;nbsp;lovely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie seems to do a full turn around with the entry into &amp;#8220;clean&amp;#8221;
space. However, this is nothing more than a trick of the eyes, an
illusion. One cyber-dystopia is replaced by another. The society on the
Axiom spacecraft is oppressive and sterile. It is new-speaked to the
point that people do not even realize that there are other human beings
next to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollywood has a problem with letting dystopic futures track all the way
through a film. But for a solid hour or so, we were in a world not worth
living in where only the cyborgs survive and only robots are capable of&amp;nbsp;love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More or less the situation is that I owe money all over the country and
no one (financial institution) is willing to help until payday or
afterwards. For a while there were serious doubts about me being able to
fund getting home / continue paying for the hotel&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t that I am not owed the money. I will be reimbursed, eventually.
But I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure I had the credit to live on. Then of course there are
the host of other burdens that I won&amp;#8217;t get&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have, sadly, gotten good at this so I remained calm and it didn&amp;#8217;t
really bother me, on a conscious level. But something was definitely
triggered inside. For a few days there I was fully distended. Like fully
to the max limit distended. No drugs or amount of calming myself down
worked (I was already&amp;nbsp;calm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t been this bad in a while, but all of the old symptoms
reemerged. I was fatigued, had an insatiable headache, trouble moving,
self-esteem problems, severe pain, and constipation. I swear I am the
only man whose ribs show when he lifts his arms and whose belly looks
pregnant at the same time. It is unnatural I tell&amp;nbsp;ye&amp;#8217;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I more or less waited it out in&amp;nbsp;bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) I bought a book and have gotten through a good portion of it. &amp;#8220;A
History of the Jews&amp;#8221; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Johnson_(writer)"&gt;some goy&lt;/a&gt;. It a good, stuffy, and academic
History that I have been wanting. Not afraid to say what the archeology
supports and doesn&amp;#8217;t support. Unfortunately also not afraid to draw the
occasional parallel between unrelated new and old testament&amp;nbsp;folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) I tried playing Crisis Core, but it bored me since I had already
beaten&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Tried to play the original Dynasty Warriors on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSP&lt;/span&gt;. Beat a map or
two but it is so inferior to the game play of the new ones that I just
don&amp;#8217;t think I will be able to get through it. Once and a while maybe to
feed my hack-n-slash addiction. Also since I bought the copy used it
came without the liner notes. I only was able to beat the first map or
two on the first try because I had gotten so good at&amp;nbsp;Gundam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Willing watched Star Trek: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt; for the first time in a long
while&amp;#8230;.And only because I came in on the episode where Picard &amp;#8212;&amp;gt;
Borg. And then they did a Data-Lore episode. Amazingly they used some of
Troi&amp;#8217;s broken abilities so I wasn&amp;#8217;t screaming at her the whole time. I
think this helped more than&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me&amp;nbsp;health.&lt;/p&gt;

to see him go. He was one of the few comedians left of his&amp;nbsp;era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll likely hear a lot of talk about him being a free-speech advocate,

Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, I can only name Paul Krassner as still&amp;nbsp;alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, others carry on this torch. Penn &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Teller carry on this

conceptual&amp;nbsp;continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

Eating them is so tasty and sacrilegious. Almost as if I am deflowering&amp;nbsp;them&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;

Only about half of the shows are worthwhile, but it has lead to some odd&amp;nbsp;attractions.&lt;/p&gt;

have only seen commercials. For some reason I find this character
incredibly hilarious and attractive. It might be the Jackie Kennedy
thing, who knows. I would propose to the first girl that dresssed like a

&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oblongs"&gt;Creepy Susie&lt;/a&gt;: From the Oblongs, this character has two things only
going for her: she&amp;#8217;s goth and her incredibly sexy accent. Unfortunately
the voice actor is older than my mom&amp;#8230;.but that voice! I never had a
thing for the French&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, despite his Dan affectations, Mr Savage is amazing. Now if only

fantasies. I cook, I clean, I like the&amp;nbsp;Kinks.&lt;/p&gt;

minimal. I do not intend on changing this stance, not just yet. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7456588.stm"&gt;But
there are things that make you go&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Huh?&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my first person evidence that people communicate is the same way
is based off of me myself communicating with boys, men, and bisexual
girls and women (mother, girlfriends, lesbian friends of my mother). Now
there is a distinct difference between homosexuality and bisexuality.
However since this study is more or less preliminary we will unfairly
lump everything&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main point is that my perception that everyone is the same or similar
*could* be just a product of selective experiences. I *may* have
even been raised to be predisposed to these selective experiences. Have
I then in some way been disadvantaged? Are my expectations of how women
should communicate skewed? Is my dogmatic belief that people are more
alike than different have no bearing on&amp;nbsp;reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am open to further inquiry, since abandoning the pursuit of equality
should not be done lightly. Interestingly enough, the researchers
themselves take their results to mean that homosexuality is in fact
nature and not nurture. I am not sure that this really holds since they
are not (from what it seems) testing over a large range of ages and
developments. Still, the work does lead to a host of other&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/p&gt;

The
distinctly British term was then used to describe the cipher machines of
the Nazis during World War&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, I brought a lone book with me on this 3 month journey from
home. This is the &amp;#8220;Cyberculture Studies&amp;#8221; book that I picked up a bit
ago. Cyberspace is a bit of an enigma itself. It is both democratizing
and exclusive. It is a broadcast framework with individualized&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the book develops a healthy description of how our current
society is developing into increasingly segregated, interdependent,
warring parts. These parts are the exclusive networked peoples, those
retaining the post-industrial lifestyle common, and the&amp;nbsp;poor/criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networked folk lead essentially a self-similar life. Their many jobs
require them to be highly transient. Thus they exist nowhere in terms of
permanent homes. But the places were they are become similar to one
another to provide them with the illusion of home. I wish I could say
that this did not&amp;nbsp;resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the applied physicist of social theory, knowing this isn&amp;#8217;t
meaningful unless empirically tested. Real rigor is left to the experts
and those with funding. But backyard experimentation is top shelf of
those waxing natural philosophic. Thus here is my&amp;nbsp;abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*At least half of the stories in &amp;#8220;The Game&amp;#8221; by Neil Strauss are likely
outright lies. However, the analogy between cybercultural networks and
that of interpersonal sexual networks is not unfounded. Relationship
culture is highly networked. Furthermore, there is a large portion of
the population that exists outside of this network (parallel to the poor
and post-industrial). Even though the structure of the system is self
supporting nodes, individuals exhibit strong taste which narrows them
from the group as a whole (personalized content). Even cornerstone
concepts such as anonymity in cyberculture can apply in the meatspace of
relationships. Thus knowing that I am &amp;#8220;in&amp;#8221; the cybernetwork but not
within the relationship network, analogous tools should allow me access
to this sphere as well. In other words, social engineering at the
relationship level is possible through cybernetic parallels in
combination with the interpersonal social group tools developed on my&amp;nbsp;friends.*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this really only serves to get me more ass, which is truly what
it is all about. Some proof of concept work is clearly apparent with the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; Cupid work. I must become more enigmatic in my personality.&amp;nbsp; I have
gotten fairly good at reading people with a small amount of
observation.&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;Thus I think a good first strategy is to read people and
then alter my personality to one that I know the other person implicitly
desires, before they catch on to what I am doing.&amp;nbsp; This creates new
nodes and flows in the relationship network.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; I guess you will have to
trust that I won&amp;#8217;t be nefarious in my methods. Nice guys finish last,
but that doesn&amp;#8217;t imply that bad guys &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; finish&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;

for whatever cultural or subcultural reasons *I* am the one who is
overdressed! And I am just wearing my typical grad school cosplay. I
did&amp;#8217;t even have my fedora&amp;nbsp;on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the coffee was good. However it was difficult to get work
done here. The music was very loud where I was sitting and there was a
retarded amount of eye candy. There were at least five (5) &amp;#8220;You, Me, No

happen to&amp;nbsp;anyone?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I am torn on whether to go back between productivity and how
Mark feels about&amp;nbsp;Twain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much&amp;nbsp;swamp!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high point of the drive today was when, after a sunny morning, there
started a light rain. I had my top down of course. But the rain wasn&amp;#8217;t
even so bad as to require my whipper blades to be turned on. I saw that
there were some storm clouds in the distance. But I hoped I could power
through them without pulling over and putting the top&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, when I hit the cloud, the light sprinkled instantly
turned to sheets. Not only did my windshield become opaque, but also I
could no more see through my glasses. And I was wet. And going eighty or
so. I do not recommend this to anyone.&amp;nbsp;Exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I don&amp;#8217;t have much to report except that the people I
have met, have in general, been of a ruder spirit, or meaner demeanor,
than I have grown accustomed to. Florida is the nicest, but they are
still shocked and disoriented when I ask how their day is. Lord save me
when I go back to the Bay Area. Perhaps North Carolina will temper me&amp;nbsp;somewhat!&lt;/p&gt;

Dragons and related role-playing games were based on &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; mythology.
I think it would be an interesting exercise and possible academic
article to denote some of this explicitly. Specifically, in the realm of
magic and its use in game. Many of the original spells and items come
directly from things out of a greater mythological structure, whether
they acknowledge this or not. So without further&amp;nbsp;ado,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish - This is basically a gimme. The wish spell is near an exact
replica of the various Djinn appearing throughout Arabian folklore. Of
course western traditions re-appropriated it in with translations of A
Thousand and One Nights. Aladdin is the most notable example. The fact
that the wish spell functions mechanically to screw over headstrong
players is reflected in the&amp;nbsp;stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep - This is one of the more interesting examples. Most players might
think that this spell is just an obvious, low-level tactical. However,
it really has a deep historical&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invisibility - This spell is arguably one of the most ancient. The word
itself is arguably the Roman translation of a god. Invisibility directly
from the Helm of Hades, used most notably in the Trojan Wars. This items
imparts invisibility unto its user. An important linguistic note is that
the word Hades is thought to be the combination of the aspirated alpha
privative with the &amp;#8220;ides&amp;#8221;, or sight. Thus Hades is literally the unseen.
This has interesting social implications for the ancient Greeks which we
won&amp;#8217;t delve into here. These subtleties are mostly overlooked in the&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alter Self/Other - These spells occur throughout almost all of
mythology. For example, many people do not realize that Merlin had the
ability to alter his appearance to that of youths, maids, and other
persons at will. Athene, of course, changes the appearance of Odysseus
to that of an old begger in order that he may slay Penelope&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;suitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hex (Curse) - Additionally curses are placed on many characters
throughout stories. The Gorgons being cursed by Athene. Morgana le&amp;#8217;Fey
handed these out like&amp;nbsp;candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flesh to Stone - Speaking of the Gorgons, this spell is an exact copy of
their supernatural gaze. The reverse of this spell is of course
triggered by slaying the monster. However, Stone to Flesh is also used
in the story of Hephaestus and&amp;nbsp;Pygmalion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Augury - This spell is the clear domain of Apollo through his oracles.
Higher divination magics are not expressed in mythos, as the future is
unknowable. However, the trance-induced visions do give vague notions
about what is to come. Generally a &amp;#8220;Weal or Woe&amp;#8221; as cryptically as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightning Bolt - This is one of the few evocation spells that is tossed
around. It is wielded by the such power houses as Odin, Thor, and&amp;nbsp;Zeus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Transmutations - A few select individuals are able to cause full
changes to their person. They tend to be deities rather than mortal
casters. Zeus even goes so far as to impregnate people while in
alternate&amp;nbsp;forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locate Object - Saint Anthony of Padua has an impressive list of
patronages. Among these are lost items and seekers of lost things. If
there is a divinely inspired reason these, then it bears inclusion on
this&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divination - This power was wielded by soothsayers and their like
throughout many traditions. However, few had true innate ability on the
level with this spell. And none more so than the blind seer Tiresias.
His punishment for such power is that of his&amp;nbsp;blindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fly - Flight is never conferred directly in legend. Icarus gains it
through the creation of artificial wings. Hermes is granted flight
through winged boots. Sinbad is content to hitch rides on&amp;nbsp;Rocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all I can think of for now. I&amp;#8217;ll update as I think of&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><category term="evilloknarisevil"></category></entry><entry><title>The ABCs ofÂ MBs</title><link href="http://anthony.scopatz.com/the-abcs-of-mbs.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-31T20:27:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Anthony Scopatz</name></author><id>tag:anthony.scopatz.com,2008-05-31:the-abcs-of-mbs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So in case you didn&amp;#8217;t know, my *real* Myers-Briggs typography is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XNXJ&lt;/span&gt;.
The first X denotes that I am neutral on the Introvert-Extrovert fronts.
The second X denotes a simultaneous Thinking-Feeling&amp;nbsp;front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time (depending on friend group) I affect a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENTJ&lt;/span&gt; type. This
is because this is the most advantageous type to have in dealings with
other. People tend to trust extroverts (usually wrongly) more initially.
Furthermore, &amp;#8220;Thinking&amp;#8221; people tend to get the more academic and
scientific and higher paying jobs than those &amp;#8220;Feeling&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are those times, where for whatever reason, I affect a
different personality type. Certainly around my cousins I am an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTJ&lt;/span&gt;. I
am an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XNFJ&lt;/span&gt; with my&amp;nbsp;parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, people have always seemed to notice and possibly get concerned when
I switch personality types while they watch on. Especially when I make
the full flip and go to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INFJ&lt;/span&gt;. I understand your response to this, but it
is nothing to be worried about. I am not sad, just&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you on your way, when I am in this other, fully natural mode of
expression and feeling, I just want to be treated kindly. I strive for
communication and understanding. I am a little lonely right now, but
that is because Trevor left&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, I don&amp;#8217;t want people to understand me, I just want them to
accept me for who I am. Me and my fluctuating&amp;nbsp;Id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rudely awoken this morning to the sound of jack hammers after a
mere 4 hours of sleep. But this time it was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; from my pool area which
is being removed and worked on. It was the from the guy&amp;#8217;s unit who
*happens* to be the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOA&lt;/span&gt; Treasurer who lives one down and over from me.
Let&amp;#8217;s call him Dan, for various reasons (none of which being his actual&amp;nbsp;name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background: Our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOA&lt;/span&gt; needs a good bit of work since the prior property
manager company was screwing up. The pool needs to come out, the fences
and railings need to be replaced or painted, and a bunch of stuff was
damaged in the hail storm. Dan boldly stepped forward in order to get
this stuff done. To cover these extra expenses Dan has assessed an
additional one-time payment of $1400 to cover these&amp;nbsp;expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past weekend the pool was being jack hammered away and is still not
done. Thus when I was awoke to these sounds I thought that our little
treasurer had some double dipping going&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went down to investigate. I asked the worker at Dan&amp;#8217;s place when the
work was going to be done and he said three days. It should be noted
that the worker appeared to be the same who was working on the pool this
past weekend. Same height, same skin tone, eye &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; hair color, and both
had&amp;nbsp;mustaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;So I sent out this message of inquiry:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Dear *Dan* and other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSC&lt;/span&gt; owners,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A couple of points have been brought to my attention:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1) The same man (didn&amp;#8217;t catch his name but is short, Chicano, and has a mustache) is doing both the work on the complex as a whole and on Brian&amp;#8217;s personal unit (#13).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2) This man was jack-hammering inside of *Dan*&amp;#8217;s property.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;3) A door knob key holder of the type real estate agents use to place on properties is on your unit.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;This brings up a number of questions I would like you to field, please.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;How many more days will work internal to your property be performed, and&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;at what times? Furthermore, I am requesting a financial disclosure of&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSC&lt;/span&gt; to ensure that no finances are accidentally mixed between our&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;communal projects and your personal ones. Moreover, are you planning on&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;selling soon? Also could you please explain the decision to remove the&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;pool weeks before the meeting when it was stated and implied in previous&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;emails that discussion of the pool area and region would be held at the&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;June 7th meeting? In general, the timeline given in the notification of&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;assessment does not seem to be held to as you are already working, could&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;you could also address this please?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Thank you for taking to time to respond to these questions. I am sure&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;it will dissuade any fears I and others may have. You can rest assured&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;that I will be at the June 7th meeting.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Be Well&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Anthony&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; I never received my in mail notification of assessment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of hours later, Dan calls me up and he is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUCKING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PISSED&lt;/span&gt;. Mostly because I sent this out to all of the other owners and I don&amp;#8217;t value him, and I am being defamatory and accusatory, and I don&amp;#8217;t have my facts straight,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out most of my fears were mislaid, which is why I wrote the
email in the first place. The worker who was working on the pool seems
to have a soul patch in addition to the mustache. This was hard to tell
since he had a gas mask on all&amp;nbsp;weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dan, meanwhile is schizophrenic in his demands. He wants to be
gentlemanly and civil about this, but would then tell me that I
&amp;#8220;disgust&amp;#8221; him and that I &amp;#8220;should just cut him a damn&amp;nbsp;check.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a property manager/treasurer this guy blows! I remained calm
throughout the discussion and insisted that it was just an inquiry and
not an allegation, even though he kept demanding that I was defaming&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real kicker is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIDN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;T &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;READ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMAIL&lt;/span&gt;! The guy who he hired to
be his property manager, call him Bob, called him and told him what I
had&amp;nbsp;written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit, it may have been wrong to send the email out to all of the
owner&amp;#8217;s initially (but this is still sort of iffy since it relates to
their investments). However, I don&amp;#8217;t think asking for financial
disclosure and addressing concerns is&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got the full story I wrote a full apology and explanation to all
of the owners again allaying my concerns and&amp;nbsp;fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically I don&amp;#8217;t think what I did or wrote or said was racist, or lazy,
or insulting in any way. I understand how someone attacking me would
construe it as&amp;nbsp;such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So my question for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; is do you think what I wrote was an inquiry or
an accusation, in both the legal and intra-personal&amp;nbsp;senses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/end&amp;nbsp;Rant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of the day doing some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAJOR&lt;/span&gt; cleaning of my
shower and tub. It is now all sparkleeeeee clean. If only I could get
the kinda ass that Mr. Clean has access&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was all in preparation for my re-caulking of the tub and
replacing the soap dish. This is a long time in coming so I am pleased
by the progress. Furthermore, I am doing it myself whereas I thought I
was going to have to hire someone. Even&amp;nbsp;Better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in preparation for not being around exercise equipment this summer,
I have taken up running. So, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;. I am one of *those* people. You know
the ones you see in their little &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UT&lt;/span&gt; shorts and cotton T-shirt that
breathes heavily at crosswalks. I am not sure how I feel about my new
found status as I always silently giggled at my associates before I
picked up this&amp;nbsp;habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap this up, I will finish with the list of movies I have seen this
summer and how I would rate them, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WITH&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COMPLETE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LACK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JUSTIFICATION&lt;/span&gt;
(out of&amp;nbsp;100):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;85&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Harold and Kumar: Escape from Guantanamo Bay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;83&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Read or Die&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;76&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Re-animator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;64&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Indiana Jones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;38&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Prince Caspian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthony and Trevor and I all went out to Rudy&amp;#8217;s, which is a local
Tex-Mex bar-ish hang-out kind-of&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were walking around while we waited for a table. We passed this
couple a couple of&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second time we passed them the young, lithe lady had the chutzpa to

different reasons. So tonight, even though there is a lot of serious
ground to cover, I will opt for a more playful&amp;nbsp;thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t sleep last night. I almost wish I had. But I had a very
productive morning and day and I wouldn&amp;#8217;t really trade that for&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My work (aka real research) has finally started to ramp up again in
earnest. It is awesome. I love having nothing to do but to sit down at a
coffee shop, in one of many hats, and hammer out some code. I think my
goal of having the vast majority of this code done and in the bag by the
time I go out to North Carolina will be done. Thus when we go out there
it will just be running a bunch of cases. Cases! Fuck&amp;nbsp;Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stomach hates me again. I am determined to look awesome by the time I
hit California again. If you can&amp;#8217;t at least delude yourself into
believing that you are sexy during the Summer, then what is the point in
living?! If I was a hypochondriac I would totally have &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

count of murder in the first&amp;nbsp;degree.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don&amp;#8217;t know who Hans Reiser is, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Reiser"&gt;you should go here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is why you should care. California recently has been involved
in too many high profile court cases which the state justice system has
completely botched. First and foremost of these on my mind is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_%22Tookie%22_Williams"&gt;Stanley
Tookie Williams&lt;/a&gt;. Hans Reiser is&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Free and Open Source Software community has long been one of
skeptics and conspiracy theorists. Furthermore, it&amp;#8217;s more prominent
members often suffer from hubris and tend to get in public cat fights
with one another. Major and successful code project are like as not to
be started because rather than branching an existing code and making it
do what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; need it to (which is what the whole experiment is all
about), programmers are just dicks to each other and think that they can
do it better all by their lonesome. Hans Reiser was certainly not free
from&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the case of Nina Reiser things simply not add up and it
doesn&amp;#8217;t take a paranoid schizophrenic (or your standard Open Source
Fan-Boy-Girl [Now with Both Genders! Didn&amp;#8217;t you get the patch?]) to see&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am not saying Hans is innocent because I *love* his file system.
I am saying that if I were a juror, I would not be able to in good
conscience say that he committed premeditated murder beyond all
reasonable&amp;nbsp;doubt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there is no body, Nina was having an affair with someone
who claims to have committed 8 previous murders (which they didn&amp;#8217;t allow
in court), and that all evidence presented was circumstantial leaves a
lot of wiggle room when condemning a fellow human&amp;nbsp;being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the evidence against him is damning I&amp;#8217;ll agree, but then there
is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/04/reiser-juror-de.html"&gt;this asshole&lt;/a&gt;. The jurors themselves don&amp;#8217;t even have a good guess
as to how the murder that they are sentencing him for took&amp;nbsp;place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what really makes me feel for him (innocent or otherwise) is when he
said&amp;nbsp;this,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I just keep thinking that I&amp;#8217;m stuck in George Orwell&amp;#8217;s 1984. The
government has taken away my kids, invaded my house, held me in solitary
confinement and caused me all sorts of financial&amp;nbsp;problems.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever had any sort of run in with the law, even a minor one,
and tried to contest it, then you know exactly what this man is going
through. (It should be noted here that I feel the most for the kids
since the state of California has now taken them away from their parents
multiple time in two&amp;nbsp;years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, since the community is as described above, you will hear a lot of
crazy stories. None of them are true! (Most likely). Nina probably did
not run away from her kids back to Russia, framing her husband. It was
not Microsoft that killed Nina to frame Hans. It wasn&amp;#8217;t the Russian
Mafia. I am sure their are other ones, but don&amp;#8217;t believe any of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just to prove that their is no justice in this world and not just in
California, I will refer you to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/29/austria.cellar/index.html?eref=rss_latest"&gt;this mans case&lt;/a&gt;. He abducted his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OWN&lt;/span&gt;
daughter when she was 11 and held her captive in a 100 sq ft room for 24
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAWDDAMNED&lt;/span&gt; years and repeatedly raped her, siring 7 of his own
children/grand-children, one of whom (of course) died. And he admits&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what his maximum sentence is? 15 years because it is
*only* rape and it is Austria. I am sorry when you you enslave
someone, you should be imprisoned for at least as long as you held them
sans any other crimes against&amp;nbsp;humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me now that California may be having all of these problems
because they have an Austrian for&amp;nbsp;governor.&lt;/p&gt;

Is that *really* appropriate?&amp;#8221; Sisko barked. Her hands
and arms had caught him by surprise from behind. No one knew about their
secret time together, least of all Jake. And that is just how the
Commander wanted to keep&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dax had become more brazen of late. He often sat and wondered if it was
some sort of Trillian mid-life crisis, or menopause, or puberty even!
Her quarters were fine, the Holosuite was fine too if they could be
guaranteed a little extra privacy. Even his own quarters were reasonable
if they knew Jake would be out. But this everywhere, all-of-the-time
business has got to stop. Just last night it had been in the Science
Lab. Julian was right there! If he&amp;#8217;d heard her moan just once, that
would be it. Both of their careers would be over. Now they were in his
office and this was getting&amp;nbsp;dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Oh come on Ben! I am the Science officer here and I am just collecting
samples.&amp;#8221; Jadzia wryly smiled, sliding her hands further down the front
of his chest. Starting to unzip his uniform. Tick. Tick.&amp;nbsp;Tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;That is it! I&amp;#8217;m..&amp;#8221; Sisko&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I am Collecting Samples!&amp;#8221; Dax butted in. Pausing for a moment to regain
her composure, &amp;#8220;And it just so happens that I require some from an Adult
Human Male. And there is nothing you can do about it.&amp;#8221; She said turning
his chair around and smothering him a kiss that was not the kind to
allow Sisko to object or even speak. Her supple breasts touching his
handsome man-chest in that light way that let both of them know that
there was only more to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Alright. I concede. But not here. Someone could walk in at any time.&amp;#8221;
he pleaded. Unfortunately for Benjamin, by the time he was done talking
she had his uniform unzipped right down to the&amp;nbsp;crotch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Ah Ah!&amp;#8221; She wagged her right index finger at him as she got down on her
knees in front of the chair. &amp;#8220;I am the doctor here. I think that makes
me the master.&amp;#8221; Jadzia&amp;nbsp;winked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dax was now cupping Sisko&amp;#8217;s lukewarm balls in her left hand and had
partially unzipped the top part of her Federation uniform. &amp;#8220;Alright
there little guy! Come on.&amp;#8221; She whispered to Benjamin&amp;#8217;s penis as it was
slowly going through the first stages of erection. Unzipping her
uniform&amp;#8217;s top completely &amp;#8220;Do you need a little motherly love?&amp;#8221; she said
as she placed his cock into her cleavage, slowly rubbing upwards and
down. Resigning himself, Sisko sat back and thought to himself that if
it is going to happen he should take it like a&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally submitting, Benjamin allowed himself the pleasure of a full,
stiff, 15&amp;#8221; hard on. Dax wasted no time. She was smothering his dark
member even more vigorously than she had him earlier. It was unfortunate
for both Jadzia and him that the Trill oral structure could not fully
account for neither the Captain&amp;#8217;s girth nor his&amp;nbsp;length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;OoooH&amp;#8221; He moaned deeply and softly as simultaneously both her mouth
retreated back to the tip of the head and she surprised him by ramming
her pinky finger up his asshole. There was an audible pop as her
lascivious mouth separated from his&amp;nbsp;head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Do you like that, baby?&amp;#8221; Dax inquired as she rotated her finger around.
It was all Sisko could do to moan briefly as he felt the cool air
evaporate the pre-cum and her saliva from off of his shaft. Before any
words could form she was back on him vigorously sucking and&amp;nbsp;pounding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all too much. Dax was always good at head, but this new finger
thing was superb. In a climactic groan, Commander Sisko expelled his
load into her mouth. Dax, surprised, pulled&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Sorry, I normally last longer.&amp;#8221; He claimed&amp;nbsp;apologetically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thumping her chest and swallowing, Jadzia said willfully &amp;#8220;Oh that is
fine, Ben. I didn&amp;#8217;t realize you liked it so much.&amp;#8221; Dax stood up, her
breasts undulating as she did so. &amp;#8220;But now for me&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; She forced the
commander up out of his seat and then ripped the rest of his uniform
off. Then turning him around so his powerful back was showing she&amp;nbsp;proclaimed,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Computer. Strap-on.&amp;nbsp;Hot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there it was. The replicator had produced a massive 24&amp;#8221; long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PVC&lt;/span&gt;
shaft with harness, shaped like a baseball bat. Jadzia knew it was his
favorite sport and thought the gesture would be&amp;nbsp;appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What are you doing Dax? You have your sample. We can stop for&amp;nbsp;now.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Oh no, you don&amp;#8217;t get off that easy. Not after that&amp;nbsp;performance.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first unlubricated ram up his firm ass hurt the most. He could feel
himself start to bleed. Sisko knew this would be bad. He wouldn&amp;#8217;t be
able to sit right for a week and people would start to ask&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWWWWW&lt;/span&gt;!!!&amp;#8221; The pull out hurt almost as badly. And why was it so warm?
Is she now taking lessons from old bad white men farther up the
Federation chain of command than him? Still, it was oddly arousing.
Jadzia always was trying new&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually she settled into a normal, rhythmic motion. He even had
started to get hard again, but by this point his face was planted on his
desk and he was bent over. &amp;#8220;Alright old man. That&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;enough.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;For you&amp;nbsp;maybe.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Stop old man.&amp;#8221; The pounding increased, along with the pain. &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOP&lt;/span&gt;! No
more!&amp;#8221; His skin was sweat bonded to the table and the increased
frequency was hurting him everywhere. &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OLD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAN&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOP&lt;/span&gt;!!!&amp;#8221; But she
just kept&amp;nbsp;going&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Sisko woke up, he was face down on the ground. Sitting up, he
noticed Dax sitting by the window, smoking. &amp;#8220;So how was it for you?&amp;#8221;,
she&amp;nbsp;asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;A lot like our time together in the&amp;nbsp;Academy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

after actually creating the account, but the preliminary results are&amp;nbsp;stellar!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first off I have been receiving an amazing number of stalks. From
Saturday to Wednesday, half a week, Mark is up to 130 stalks/week.
Jessica (Javilina) in other news is back up to 196 stalks/week&amp;nbsp;herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We let you both know as a courtesy. You can turn this off if you&amp;#8217;d like,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====d&amp;nbsp;wrote=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;! Hey. Most of my messages like this tell me that I suck because I
gave somebody a one just to see the next person- well, cool for you,
because I rock. Plus, I guess I think you rock, too, therefore the
awesome message that we gave each other high marks- and everybody needs
some&amp;nbsp;love-.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh, neat&amp;#8230; I don&amp;#8217;t do Texas, but I&amp;#8217;d do&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahahaha you had me laughing so hard with &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t do Texas, but I&amp;#8217;d
do you.&amp;#8221; In fact I could say the same thing Iowa. (I had an Uncle get
married there. I was not a fan of the&amp;nbsp;wedding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that this proves, sir, beyond a shadow of a doubt that
we both&amp;nbsp;rock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You look pretty cold in some of your&amp;nbsp;pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

name Simon sounds like our word for semen? Gross,&amp;nbsp;eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do rock, thank you. Oh, and the only cold thing about me is my heart.
If that was a funny &amp;#8220;Texas is never cold joke&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; &amp;#8230; &amp;#8230;well, at least

OKCupid profile for Javilina/Jessica. I am sure mostly because my last
post pertained to just&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well about two weeks ago Patrick made a
joke-I-didn&amp;#8217;t-know-was-a-joke-at-the-time over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;#8220;Hey you should make
a profile for every gender and sexual preference&amp;nbsp;combination.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reply was a definitive &amp;#8220;No. That is way too much work. But maybe
covering all of the sexual preferences would be doable and fun!&amp;#8221; The
math at the time worked out as follows. 1) Me: straight male. 2)
Jessica: bisexual female. So the only two combinations missing from this
scheme are bisexual and gay males. These two birds can be hit with one
stone: gay&amp;nbsp;male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So meet &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=flavilin"&gt;Mark Walker&lt;/a&gt;, my gay male alter&amp;nbsp;ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark&amp;#8217;s profile name is &amp;#8216;flavilin&amp;#8217;. This of course is just &amp;#8216;fl&amp;#8217; as in
flavor + &amp;#8216;avilin&amp;#8217; my screen name. The creation of this profile went a
lot easier but the role-playing experience is no less intense. I even
managed to rope Patrick into a bit making it an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARG&lt;/span&gt; of&amp;nbsp;sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark is part of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_community"&gt;bear culture&lt;/a&gt;, or certainly wants to be. A bear cub
shall we say. This is tactical decision as I cannot swing the standard
gay male vibe. In fact I make a pitiful bear, but it&amp;nbsp;suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, I have the horrendous U-mustache for the part
and I actually went out and bought Texas Formal Wear (jeans and a cowboy
hat) for the&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I could not immediately shave off the &amp;#8216;stash since my
friend Tony was coming into town on Sunday. These pictures were taken
Friday night. Tony actually looks like a bear and taking some pictures
with him will lend credence to my more ursine&amp;nbsp;persuasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically I have been walking around town all weekend with my
ridiculous mustache. While I was at I figured why not actually try to
play the part in real life. You know see how it works. Mark is a much
more explicitly extroverted fellow than myself. Also, he is gay.
Needless to say I got treated a lot&amp;nbsp;differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, it has been &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; positive. I am not treated like the
nerd/pencil-pusher/academic that I normally swing. People see the
mustache smirk, laugh, but then respect. Then when it turns out I am
outgoing and nice, they are always congenial back. I am not harmful or
malicious or cunning. The mustache disarms their defense and then they
open up. It is&amp;nbsp;incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has happened with just about everyone new I have met this weekend.
It has been wonderful. I sat down in Intellectual Property (bookstore)
and had a 20 min conversation with the checker about Poverty,
Sustainability, Children&amp;#8217;s Stories, and Tactics for Making the World a
Better Place. This is not something Anthony is privy to and not
something Jessica is interested in. I could very easily get used to
being in this brave new&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much to tell but I think I have written enough for now.&amp;nbsp;Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;: Mom, you now have the gay son you always&amp;nbsp;wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT2&lt;/span&gt;: I just added a couple of more pictures with me and Big Bear&amp;nbsp;Travis.&lt;/p&gt;

week! For those of you who do not use the site, this is simply how many
people have viewed your profile in the aforementioned time&amp;nbsp;allotment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, yesterday there were some simply amazing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; exchanges that I just *have* to publish here. This thread is locked because of this. I mean we can all have a good laugh at these people, but really should the general public? It is not like we are Anonymous, though some of us may be&amp;nbsp;traps.&lt;/p&gt;

since my guinea pigs are like my kids right now I named them like they
were. Paul came first of&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;wrote=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heh, awesome! I figured they had to be. Not many people would really
come up with the name Duncan just out of the blue. :) So I take it your
name must be Jessica? I love Dune as well, although I have to admit that
I only made it halfway through Children of Dune. One of these days I&amp;#8217;m
going to have to start that series over again, and finish it this time.
I&amp;#8217;ve also got both of the Sci Fi Channel miniseries on Dune and Children
of Dune. I like them much better than the older David Lynch&amp;nbsp;movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====javilina&amp;nbsp;wrote=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heya, yeah Dune is pretty amazing.&amp;nbsp; I really like Children tho!&amp;nbsp; You
should totally pick it back up.&amp;nbsp; I dunno, I like both the movie&amp;nbsp;so&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=====&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;wrote=====&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, what I read of Children was pretty good. I do need to start it
again. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt;, I heard they&amp;#8217;re going to make a new Dune movie. Not sure
what to think of that news yet&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;m not sure the story can really be
told properly in a 2 or 3 hour&amp;nbsp;movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an entirely different compulsion than the urge for casual sex
that been the unfulfilled mainstay of my Texas experience. But a
relationship! Oy Vey! That is a separate beast entirely. A partnership.
An investment. A giving up of freedom with respect to my peer&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I really want this? Do I really want such dependence? Do I really
want to care about someone? Do I really want to procreate? Do they? Do I
want to alter my life plans to include an Other? Do I want someone who
will pretend to understand me?&amp;nbsp;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe is about the best I can muster. Obviously the answers all depend
on a lot of&amp;nbsp;factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And though you may not have been able to tell, factors are what this
post is all&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have goals in our transience, though they may not be so lofty as
to deserve the name. Some have the goal of joining the clergy, others of
becoming scientist. Sometimes our goals can be more base: being pretty,
getting laid, getting high. Usually our baser goals are steps towards
other goals, like&amp;nbsp;forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More plentiful than the goals are our options, methods, ways, means, and
factors that can be used to achieve these goals. One may wish to write a
song, but the number of instrument permutations available is effectively&amp;nbsp;infinite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ikariam and other free-form games and Capitalism have a vague sense of
progression. You want more of something and you start off with nothing
or near enough. However, there are many things to want and many ways to
acquire them. Individual strategies will be based on individual goals.
No two people could possibly play the game the same way; like&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this relevant? Historically, I have spent almost all of my time
and research into furthering my academic abilities with a healthy side
smattering of art. I studies Aphrodite with Promethean desire, but could
not accept the vanity of her&amp;nbsp;embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My clear goal when I came to Texas was certainly not to date. I did not
feel comfortable with my body. How could I ask someone else to accept me
when I can&amp;#8217;t accept myself? A paradigm shift in my values towards a more
aesthetic me-ness took place. In my self-loving defense, it should be
noted that I can&amp;#8217;t accelerate my academic growth any faster than I
already have, though Lord knows I have&amp;nbsp;tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the goal changed, as did what I was researching. However, I may now
be approaching the point where I can no longer be fully focused on this
goal. Yet the goal has yet to truly be achieved. So while I approach it,
the answer to the aboves should go from maybe to&amp;nbsp;yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet even inside this goal there are have been unanticipated options I
have available. Initially, it was all about gross weight. This is a good
first order approximation but it wasn&amp;#8217;t exact enough. I need to worry
about muscle mass and fat mass as well. I probably could have
anticipated needed to turn these knobs, but the time has now come and my
hand reaches out to grasp. If I can get these variable in the right
ratios and solve my stomach problems I will probably be able to really
say, &amp;#8220;O Hai, I can haz&amp;nbsp;date?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Of course we all have side goals. For instance, I may have used
language at the begging of this post that would subtly indicate that
even though I am now interested I am apprehensive about relationships
because of some past occurrences with them. This would of course be in
order to reinforce some notions about me I think you have. Reinforcing
such notions is naturally one of the better levers I have available &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOR&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TEH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LULZ&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/p&gt;

cyber-punk. The original of course jumped the shark some time between

&lt;p&gt;Firstly I have been really negligent on my workout schedule in the past
months. I really have been slacking off. I really haven&amp;#8217;t done more than
a day or two here and there since the start of Winter&amp;nbsp;Break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad, I know. I have a ton of excuses (Winter depresses me) but I won&amp;#8217;t
go into them. The long of the short of it is that I resigned last night
to kick myself into gear and make sure I burn at least 1000 kCal per day
for the month of April and the remainder of March. I figure this would
at least give me a fighting chance of being in shape by&amp;nbsp;summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after my workout today I did the dreaded thing and got on the scale
and weighed myself to see how out of shape I really was. I thought I was
about 150 lbs which would mean I was 15 lbs off of my 135 mark that I
set years&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TADA&lt;/span&gt;! After years I have finally made it! I checked in at a mere 134.5&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, right? Well maybe not. Yes, I have hit my weight goal (which
is totally awesome). However, I know I have more body fat on me than I
did in November. I also know I am not as strong. So what I think has
happened is that I have traded Muscle Mass for fat. Not quite the trade
one&amp;nbsp;wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my target weight may be more like 137.5, with muscle! I think I can
live with this. My strategy of eating more fruit and protein and less
carbs certainly took the weight off for the past&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the scale could have been off and this is all a cruel&amp;nbsp;joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way I will be exercising to become sexy for summer. Here&amp;#8217;s to
hoping I don&amp;#8217;t bulk up and my stomach will finally not hate&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SECONDLY&lt;/span&gt;: The new facebook thing that shows you people you *might*
know has got to be the worst thing they have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVAR&lt;/span&gt; done. What if there is
someone(s) who you used to be in high school with who for whatever
reason you now can&amp;#8217;t stand to see. Even that quarter inch thumbnail
might just make you&amp;nbsp;snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, this wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so bad but there is no way to turn it off!&amp;nbsp;Yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone isn&amp;#8217;t my &amp;#8220;friend&amp;#8221; I probably don&amp;#8217;t want them to be. Sorry
Mark Zuckerberg, I don&amp;#8217;t actually like everyone. If it suggested you as
my friend, I would totally ignore&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, enough ranting. Back to the grindstone for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;

I had this wonderful idea bout a month ago
that culminated in some illicit pictures being taken last&amp;nbsp;weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the idea: What if I created a female OKCupid profile for myself?
Aside from just getting an answer to the &amp;#8220;What is my type of man?&amp;#8221;
question, this account would allow me to very effectively troll a good
number of the males (and a few females) on the site. So to borrow from
4chan, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONWARD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TEH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LULZ&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we go to last Friday where I explained this at dinner to all of my
Austinite friends. The immediate reaction was one of both shock and
hilarity. Probably pretty close to what you are going through right now.
That night we took some camwhore/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FGAS&lt;/span&gt; pictures. Since then I have been
working on a profile with Robin and Patrick&amp;#8217;s help&amp;nbsp;(Thanks!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the profile is not done, it is in a passable state. It is still a
work in progress so if you have any ideas or suggestions, please let me.
The profile may be seen &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.okcupid.com/profile?u=javilina"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (please check it out). Note that the
profile name is &amp;#8216;javilina&amp;#8217;. This is simply &amp;#8216;j&amp;#8217; + &amp;#8216;avilin&amp;#8217; +&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please also note that this is a total group effort (it takes a village).
If you want in or just have some comments or suggestions, please let me&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="observations-and-implications"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBSERVATIONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMPLICATIONS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) While once I might have been more effeminate in body type than
masculine, those days are sadly&amp;nbsp;gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) This is soundly the most intense role-playing experience I have ever
had. To create Javilina (whose real name is Jessica) required an amount
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RP&lt;/span&gt; that can only be compared to method acting. However, rather than
being given a character I had to make everything up. This is supposed to
be a believable, independent person. Every detail and decision should
have a plausible reason for its existence and all of the pieces must fit
together. This is far more work than either method acting or RPing. Even
character generation for novels and other written stories must be
easier. This is because the story teller is giving the context that the
character exists in. The reader may then infer the details that are not
given explicitly from this context. My context here is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.getafirstlife.com/"&gt;Real Life&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Some of you may have noticed that Javilina&amp;#8217;s real name is Jessica.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MH&lt;/span&gt; crowd will understand that this is the only purely female
(non-androgynous) name that I can slip into comfortably. The rest of you
will note that she is named after Lady Jessica from the &amp;#8220;Dune&amp;#8221; books.
Her guinea pigs are named Paul and Duncan, which is a dead give away&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) Part of why I thought of this in the first place and why it works was
because I realized that females (and apparently gay males) get a lot
more attention than your average straight male on OKCupid. However,
before I started this endeavor in earnest I had no emotional attachment
to this observation. That has definitely changed. At first I felt kinda
dirty by all of the &amp;#8220;stalkers&amp;#8221; that javilina was getting. This lead me
to feel bad for all of those women out there who use the site seriously.
This, of course, is a condescending attitude and was quickly dropped.
However the attention ratio &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 1 for the avilin / javilina profiles.
This got me feeling sorry for mine own biology. Of course this is all
for the LuLz so I can&amp;#8217;t ever really feel all that&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) Encased in all of this is really the whole story of how our
cyber-society is evolving. But that my friends, is its own&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you read at least enough of this to get the gist of what is going
on with my gender bending&amp;nbsp;extravaganza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we were doing these quests (Elixir of Pain, Suffering,
Weltangschadenfreude (German pun call out for Trevs, Wat! Wat!)).
Anyways, we were on this one were you have to go feed this dog some
poison in Hillsbrad&amp;nbsp;fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point my brother is a 22 Hunter and I am a 23 Warlock. But this
dork of a PvP-flagged 31 Night Elf Druid or something comes up and
starts following us and making rude gestures and laughing at us. We
weren&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;biting&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then she goes and stands right in the stupid dog as I click to start
poison it. And of course I accidentally attack and PvP flag myself. My
brother, who I was telling to run, wisely stood his ground and kept&amp;nbsp;attacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this jerk didn&amp;#8217;t count on was that we both had pets, I would spam
every DoT spell I had, *&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt;* that my brother&amp;#8217;s concussive shot would
stun her for a few second while we wailed on&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I died when she was at like 10% health and then my bro finished her off!
So amazing! Our two broken classes beat a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; 8-9 levels higher than us!
And of course, I just soul stoned right back up and we were ready to&amp;nbsp;go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my years of playing WoW, I have never heard of something quite that
weird happening. But the story gets stranger&amp;nbsp;still&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little later we were in Silverpine Forest leveling up my brother&amp;#8217;s
skinning. Someone challenged him to a duel which he fought and lost
since he didn&amp;#8217;t have his pet out. But we went down along the road and he
wanted to challenge me to see what it would be like when he was ready
for&amp;nbsp;it&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;.When a level 70 Night Elf Hunter on an epic mount comes riding up to
watch. Then as the duel starts, he runs up in front of me and causes my
brother to &amp;#8216;accidentally&amp;#8217; attack him. Then the Hunter pulls out a rifle
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt;! one shot in the face kills my brother. (We didn&amp;#8217;t even get a
chance to hit each&amp;nbsp;other).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunter then camps my brother&amp;#8217;s corpse and waits for him to rez so
that he can kill him again. I wait around and tell my brother not to rez
until we are sure the punk is gone. This guy even leaves and then
doubles back hoping that he rez&amp;#8217;d. After that didn&amp;#8217;t work he finally&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, my brother and I figure it was the same player that was
soooooo pissed that we got his alt, that he hunted us down with bigger
guns. Unfair, but&amp;nbsp;lulzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I went and grinded mageweave in Nethergaurde Keep. Did you
know you can do that without getting PvP flagged? I was in their base,
killing their mans, and there was nothing they could do about it! It was
awesome. Take that Alliance&amp;nbsp;Scum!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Awhile ago I found &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/128/2"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article online. At the time i sent it to
Robin and we had a good discussion about it. The basic gist of it is on
a neurological level, primate tool use comes down to a subtle mind trick
that other animals don&amp;#8217;t have. This trick, as it turns out, is that we
primates fool our minds into thinking that the tool that we are using is
actually part of our own&amp;nbsp;body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The science behind this is interesting (the exact same sequence of
synapses firing irrespective of tool a tool being in hand or not).
However, this interested me less than the social ramifications of such a&amp;nbsp;discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to understand how we may trick ourselves into believing that
simple tools are actually part of our greater corpus. But what does this
kinda thing mean for body modification? Piercings, silicone horns, etc
are all actually part of your body! If you were to cover yourself in
scarp metal (ala Tetsuo: The Iron Man), this would be your new body.
Your mind wouldn&amp;#8217;t know the&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this seams like a stretch, then consider some of our more complicated
tools. Nearly everyone has driven a car. After a while driving and after
&amp;#8220;getting used to&amp;#8221; a vehicle, in some sense driving becomes natural.
Think about that, driving is one of the most unnatural day-to-day
experiences there is. But we all know the feeling. Very few long time
drivers while driving think of themselves as explicitly being in a car,
driving. The car is, in the driver&amp;#8217;s mind, part of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so that was all old hat for some people. Here is the new, juicy&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Here are a couple of canonical relationship phrases:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1) &amp;#8220;You are just using me.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2) &amp;#8220;Two are as (become) one.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the amazing thing about this primate stuff is that it offers an
avenue for a proof of the equivalence of those two statements.
Furthermore it means that 1) is not a bad thing and 2) is not&amp;nbsp;sappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how the argument goes. When people are physically touching and
moving and trying to manipulate each other, each person is regarding the
other as a tool in the primate brain way (not emotionally). However,
since the other person is a tool (in some sense), the first person&amp;#8217;s
mind is thus incorporating the other into their perception of their own
body by&amp;nbsp;necessity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus we have a situation where two individuals each have subsumed the
other into their&amp;nbsp;body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural situation where this comes up is sex (though wrestling may
count). As with all primates, there is some learning time that goes into
fooling you mind to thinking your tool is a part of you. This explains
why long time partners are more apt to say &amp;#8220;You are just using me for
sex!&amp;#8221; and that &amp;#8220;It feels right&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;I couldn&amp;#8217;t live with out you&amp;#8221; with
their&amp;nbsp;spouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there is a basis for these otherwise ridiculous statements
amazes me&amp;nbsp;still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go ahead! Use your partner, because really, at the end of the day,
you are just using yourself. And that, my friend, is called&amp;nbsp;masturbation.&lt;/p&gt;

have repeatedly seen in various printed and online publication various
checklists of all of the presidential candidates and their stances on
various positions. (Perhaps you know of one, Kerry&amp;nbsp;Prime?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeatedly, these studies have said that there were only two (real, not
lip service) environmentalist candidates as I recall. These two were
McCain and Richardson. Or Ole&amp;#8217; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AZ&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NM&lt;/span&gt; as one might call them. Well
Richardson is out (for now, though please make a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VP&lt;/span&gt; bid even though this
will likely go to&amp;nbsp;Edwards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Q. So What does Super (Not Monkey) Tuesday leave us with?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A. McCain vs Either Obama or Clinton.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus on the environmentalism issue which is closest to my heart, it
looks like the republicans have won. Clinton clearly is a social reforms
candidate and doesn&amp;#8217;t care (which is why Bill had Gore in the first
place). Obama, from his speech at the Obamarama down here deep in the
heart of Texas was also pretty clearly not putting the environment
anywheres close to the top of his list. He is very much an Anti-war,
populist&amp;nbsp;candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dislike McCain on many issues. Unfortunately, I dislike Hillary on
those same issues for different or even the same reasons. Obama, of
course, is fuzzy on anything that isn&amp;#8217;t related to&amp;nbsp;Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is what the Presidential race has come to, I might have to go
McCain. Not that being in Texas, my choice in president will really make
a difference. My state is going to McCain with or without my
electronically cast&amp;nbsp;ballot.&lt;/p&gt;

Specifically, their&amp;nbsp;writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the time it is just so bad that it isn&amp;#8217;t even self consistent
(lore, lol amiright?). This hurts my head so much I could&amp;nbsp;cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then! Then there are these other times where it is so amazing I
could weep tears of joy. This happens to be when they do take into
consideration their own extensive back&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you haven&amp;#8217;t guessed, I just watched the Zul&amp;#8217;Aman trailer.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/implemented/2p3"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/implemented/2p3&lt;/a&gt;.html# This
trailer is quite possibly one of the best things they have ever done.
When Zul&amp;#8217;Jin&amp;nbsp;says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;And now, They [blood elves] fight along side the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HORDE&lt;/span&gt;!?! I spit on the
Horde. I hate you. I hate you&amp;nbsp;all&amp;#8230;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nearly creamed. Half of it is the way he says it. This trailer is
still some of the best &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RP&lt;/span&gt; that any of the Warcraft products have to
offer. Note in the begging battle between humans and elves vs trolls
that they are decked out in War I &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, for Wrath of the Lich King it has been announced that
they will finnally be doing something with Dalaran. Wonderful. Except
this something is literally lifting the city off of the ground and
floating it over to hang around &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABOVE&lt;/span&gt; Northrend. I shit you not
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Dalaran"&gt;http://www.wowwiki.com/Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does this make no sense it also removes the clitoris ala South
Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut from the game. I thought they were gonna
do something cool with Dalaran since they have so much to work with, but
this is&amp;nbsp;retarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sitting in the emergency room waiting for Seekatz to get his
stitches. He fell on the curb and hit his head at Patrick&amp;#8217;s place. I
hope it is not too serious. He has a headache but they haven&amp;#8217;t done any
sort of imaging yet (x-ray, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt;) to know if there is any internal
damage. He was hit right above his left eye. I got to the hospital at
about 3:30 and he hasn&amp;#8217;t fell unconscious since then but apparently was
doing so before. Now we just wait and see. Everyone else except for
Robin&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty concerned. However to lighten the mood we all took bets on
the number of stitches he will get. I have a dollar on 5 and another
dollar on&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my front, I am taking Donnatal for my stomach problems. It seems to
be working which is awesome. I would say that after only 5 days of
treatment and working out I am down to only 10-15%&amp;nbsp;bloatedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this drug is having some unintended side effects that are really
annoying. For one I haven&amp;#8217;t been lethargic or tired when awake, but I
have been sleeping for 12 hours straight without waking up once. This is
sucky since I would like to have that extra 4 hours every day when work
hits hard. Hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll have learned to live with these effects by the
time I am in such a&amp;nbsp;situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second (super-)annoying side effect is that I now have a vastly
reduced sex drive. It isn&amp;#8217;t that I am not interested as much or that it
is any less satisfying. However, I feel less of the omnipresent
compulsion that I typically experience. This is disappointing to say the
least. Is this what being old feels like? Knowing my family I doubt it.
Being the stereotypical female? Once again, not in my family. This
experience is totally&amp;nbsp;unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But my stomach isn&amp;#8217;t bloated anymore&amp;#8230;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And neither am I having sex&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;It would be nice to have someone to play with my piercing ^_^&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Tokyo in Japanese art is a common theme. Beyond this, the occurrence of
characters who singularly hold the power to destroy cities and/or
civilizations at a whim is similarly prevalent even if the setting is
not modern or futuristic. Frequently this mighty characters do succumb
and end up taking out whatever major population center. For classic
anime examples, Tokyo is destroyed twice in the Akira universe, three
times in the Eva one, and is leveled merely as a plot device in Magic
Knight Rayearth. Perhaps oddest of all, major population centers are
leveled for comedic effect in&amp;nbsp;Slayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is often perceived to be a form of emotional release of the
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Japanese in their art that is
exported to the States never seem to address the destruction directly,
but replay it over and over again with a different twist each time. But
as I said earlier, all this is known to your standard weeaboo&amp;nbsp;fare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of points may have missed their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCD&lt;/span&gt; eyes as a well as those of
the common consumer in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. We here in the United States have no
problem talking about the Bomb. Truman in his biography even beliefs. 1)
We generally believe it is good to talk about the past in order that it
doesn&amp;#8217;t oppress us, 2) if not fully sorry, we are apologetic and
empathetic to the Japanese people, 3) it is good that we got the bomb
before the Russians or God forbid the Nazis. I also think that most
people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; think that the Japanese method of subversive angst
towards the bombings is unhealthy, not that it is really our place to&amp;nbsp;comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now cut to 9-11. Now that we have talked (via the media, federal
elections, commission reports) to death the terror attacks we are
secretly dealing emotionally in the same way that the Japanese have been
with the&amp;nbsp;bombings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got out of &amp;#8220;Cloverfield&amp;#8221; and a week or two ago I saw &amp;#8220;I am
Legend&amp;#8221;. Both dealt with the destruction of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;. In media outside of
film, the book &amp;#8220;World Without Us&amp;#8221;, which talked about nature reclaiming
civilization should humanity mysteriously disappear, spent the first
150-200 pages giving a detailed example of how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; would fall apart.
This is especially poignant since the author could have chosen any other
city in the world to&amp;nbsp;analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloverfield was the most upfront about their social commentary. In one
scene, an extra says in the background , &amp;#8220;Do you think it is another
terrorist?&amp;#8221; In a similarly brilliant move and just as self-aware move,
the main character Rob Hawkins is getting a promotion to Vice President
which forces him to move oversees to, you guessed it, Japan. Given the
Alternate Reality Game (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARG&lt;/span&gt;) that surrounded and promoted the film, it
is pretty clear that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;J. J.&lt;/span&gt; Abrams is fully conscious of his own
criticisms and that they aren&amp;#8217;t just being inferred from this&amp;nbsp;viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So are we destined to see New York City destroyed again? Unfortunately I
think so. Americans (North and South) have long understood that trade
and culture meshing is a two way street. On this side of the Pacific,
our lives have been enriched by the Japanese. Similarly, whether or not
they are too isolationist or not to admit it, the Japanese people have
been positively affected by our way of life. However, in this one small
thing, I am not sure the continued destruction of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; is healthy. In
this case the media&amp;#8217;s overzealous, impulsive reporting might well save
us from having art that flirts with the issue as our only collective
outlet. What&amp;#8217;s more, as long as the effects are good and the story
interesting, I will probably keep going back to see more. Bing on the
big&amp;nbsp;guns!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(See I could have been a film major. Maybe a shitty film&amp;nbsp;major&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;

suburb of Sacramento. Other than Sean, who I am visiting, this place is
the Anti-Austin. Basically this town looks like the perverse combination
of rampant commercialism/capitalism crossed with a town that was built
yesterday. Every store chain you could possibly think of is within a 5
mile radius. I could never live here. On the other hand, Sean is here
and that is awesome. Also the Fry&amp;#8217;s Electronics is train themed and
really well&amp;nbsp;decorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I survived the holiday season (does that mean we can
shoot them?). I am still no closer to deciding what I ultimately want to
do with my life. However I talked things through with Sean today (about
our respective goals) and I think I am going to try to really do
something big. The option is there for me (I think/hope) such that if I
worked hard and wanted to I could settle into a comfortable middle class
lifestyle. However, I think I can do better. Somehow, someway I could
make an impact on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;/world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple ideas on this front which I have expressed to Sean and
mentioned to Seekatz, but enacting them will take a lot of work and be
tricky. Furthermore, in the mean time something significant but more
reasonable may come along. I am hesitant to express it&amp;nbsp;yet&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean helped though I have resolved not to just easily slip into the
academic world just yet. To really distinguish myself I have to do
something else. For my cousin Aaron that is writing for Wired. I am less
journalistically interested. I think journalism is a tool and I may be
able to turn that to my advantage but not a means in and of itself. I am
still rolling ideas around in my head hoping to form a general plan
where various stages build off of one&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really important about this though I think is that it means I
will put off the direct search for Companionship+ indefinitely. If all
goes well, life will just happen to me. Time to put the pieces together.
I give myself 5&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;

before. It always amazes me how old friends fit like a pair of old
shoes. Comfortable and warm, enjoyable and meant for each other are
these relationships. What I love most about these times is how little it
matters what the two of you have done in the intervening time. You just
put &amp;#8216;em on and&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not friends because of the difference that currently keep you
apart, but are friends because you are there in the moment with each
other. This camaraderie is refreshing. The Post-Masters-Degree-Coital
high was fun and lasted a couple of days, but I quickly got sick of it
in some ways. The fact that with certain friends it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter
either way is spectacular. This is mainly true for the friends that were
spared the destruction while it occurred (Sorry&amp;nbsp;Austin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I am always pleased at the selection my cousin&amp;#8217;s entourage makes in
terms of adding new people to their greater friend group. I have yet to
be disappointed. Even if these are merely fair-weather friends, the sea
is clam, the sky is blue, the wind is solid, and it is smooth sailing
from&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

when we got home so it hasn&amp;#8217;t made it into the room yet. That is the
goal for&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is funny being back in the Santa Ynez Vally. And California. Have I
said that before&amp;#8230;.I believe I have. I think one of the main
differences between California and Texas is that the rich people in
Texas are at the minimum respectful to the poor people at least to their
faces. For this quality I value Texas highly. On the other hand, the
unwashed masses of California are a lot nicer to each than those of
Texas. This is only true as long as the impoverished Californian is not
trying to emulate their rich neighbor (which happens all to&amp;nbsp;often).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also it is worth noting that the societies really don&amp;#8217;t differ greatly,
but it is the little things that one can pick out. Also, and I&amp;#8217;ll likely
be reamed for this somewhere, but Southern California has often seemed a
much friendlier place than northern&amp;nbsp;California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This North-South split is true for a lot of the county though. Idaho vs
Arizona, New Mexico vs Montana. My god! It makes me want to be a
Southerner! Even if someone is just being nice and they actually hate
you, I think that is an improvement in day-to-day interactions to
expressing their&amp;nbsp;derision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a terrible thing to hate someone, but on rare occasion it cannot
be prevented. Should you really waste that on the random person in the&amp;nbsp;street?&lt;/p&gt;

I went to the dump, put polyacrylic finish on the bedroom door, re-hung
the two doors and painted the guest closet a light pink. All of this

needs to be finished and then put up and the grouter&amp;#8217;s are coming
tomorrow and the guest room won&amp;#8217;t be accessible until Tuesday. Which is
fine. We bought a mattress today and varnished the door and did a lot of
storage moving around and the like. But really, in life, isn&amp;#8217;t grout
more&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I forgot. The standard fare of chix out here is California hot.
Maybe since it is where I grew up or there might a substantially greater
image self-conscious out here, but the difference is Stark (Winter is&amp;nbsp;Coming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funniest thing that happened today was by far this iPhone
advertisement I saw. It is a normal lame add, but at the end they go to
call someone (you just one of the feature of this so-called phone).
However, the person that is being called has alittle picture avatar of a
vaguely azn woman whose name is Anna Haro. With a name like that she
should go out and become one. I must say I didn&amp;#8217;t take Apple for&amp;nbsp;/b/tards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low point was either the Walmart electronics section -&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt;- Home Depot
-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt;- being called &amp;#8220;Tony&amp;#8221; a couple hundred&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;

I am sleeping in the closet again. Hopefully this will be the last time
as we are doing a Storage Space/Guest room furniture shuffle tomorrow
and then going to the bastion of civilization called Santa Maria to buy
a mattress. At this poitn I will then be in the guest bedroom. There are
no curtains in here yet, so I may have to improvise. Furthermore, the

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, one could simply post the first sentence or two from each

&lt;div class="line"&gt;The things I think of in the tub.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I have made a little box in my closet. It is equivalent to a shoe box. I think I shall go fill it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I hope Kerry Prime feels better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;If you are going to go through the pain of having become that frustrated without release, you might as well enjoy it.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My desire for completeness or, lacking that, fidelity and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MCNP&lt;/span&gt; are kicking my ass right now.&lt;/div&gt;

</summary></entry><entry><title>Stay Awhile and SeanÂ Conneryâ¦.</title><link href="http://anthony.scopatz.com/stay-awhile-and-sean-connery.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-05T20:30:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Anthony Scopatz</name></author><id>tag:anthony.scopatz.com,2007-12-05:stay-awhile-and-sean-connery.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I am pretty much back to normal. Tomorrow I throw my two cents into
the academic world for the first&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been trying to take my limited knowledge of how people
work and apply it to larger social structures in order to understand and
predict those. Naturally, I am starting out small with sub-cultures.
However, the problem I have already uncovered is that sub-cultures bleed
into one&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, you might say, &amp;#8220;Duh!&amp;#8221; However, I assure you that it is not as
trivial as that. For example, one can be fairly specific and say &amp;#8220;well I
am only going to study myspace or how people comment on youtube.&amp;#8221; That
is a pretty distinct subset of people and their time in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. However,
especially online but in the real world as well, there is so much
corollary information availible about each individual user that further
connotations can be readily&amp;nbsp;applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you look only at people who have camwhore pictures on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OKC&lt;/span&gt;, this website provides tons of extra information and trends may be
followed other than their implicit photogenic smuttiness. In person,
clues like dress, gait, and of course speech patterns are&amp;nbsp;revealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is my point, inside of a specific regime, using peripheral
information additional subcultures can be identified that both exist
outside of and within the regime. E.g. Reading someone&amp;#8217;s craigslist
personal ad, you can tell a good amount about them and predict many
things that they are not saying (Meyers-Briggs). However if you read a
lot of ads looking for say someone who likes the outdoors, you may also
find that they have similar personality types or hair lengths and styles
or whatnot. Thus there is a distinct subset of people on craiglist who
are outdoorsy. It is then tempting to apply the outdoorsy personality
type on craigslist to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; outdoorsy people. But this is a logical
fallacy and there is a danger in doing so (though one would likely not
be far off the&amp;nbsp;mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is troublesome for studying sub-cultures on their lonesome, because
no matter haw far you subdivide, another trend will just overspill into
it. How people coalesce into a sub-culture dynamic cannot,therefore, be
studied independently from all other typographies its constituent
members are&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So although I think I have a handle on people and how to predict (within
error) their behavior, people in groups where I do not know all members
is still&amp;nbsp;difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Worry, I am not giving up&amp;#8230;I just need a way to not have to
understand all subgroups simultaneously. After that, ????,&amp;nbsp;Profit!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any&amp;nbsp;Ideas?&lt;/p&gt;
</summary></entry><entry><title>GroupHug</title><link href="http://anthony.scopatz.com/grouphug.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-12-03T18:19:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Anthony Scopatz</name></author><id>tag:anthony.scopatz.com,2007-12-03:grouphug.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I found this new (to me) website called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://grouphug.us/"&gt;http://grouphug.us/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is basically the product successively sticking PostSecret and 4chan
in a juicer and then straining out the pictures. It has all the derision
of the Internet Hate Machine and all of the depression of mailing in the
messed up feeling you have to a person who will publish them and not pay
you a&amp;nbsp;cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GroupHug is basically an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRL&lt;/span&gt; version of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wowdetox.com/"&gt;http://www.wowdetox.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I am enjoying it thoroughly. My favorite one so far&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;943097983 I fantasize about my guild&amp;nbsp;leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of them are the typical relationship bemoaning ones. The good ones
of these are in how they tell the story since the subject is so used.
But most of the really good ones come out of&amp;nbsp;nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;905739078 i absolutely hate you amy. especially your giant&amp;nbsp;nose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I haven&amp;#8217;t posted anything serious in a while. Most of what has
been up has been *chan related anyways. I have been busy lately.
Besides that my mind has been broken down by this thesis and various
other spirits of past and present. The present ones torment my days and
the past my nights. I dig a hole to bury the hatchet as Sisyphus&amp;nbsp;rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly I can&amp;#8217;t wait for this semester to be done. I can&amp;#8217;t wait to get
out of this city. I hate cities, but I think you knew that. I know it is
Austin and all and the happy fun wunderkind of Tejas&amp;#8230;but I am bored
and worn out. I need to get back to the country. A place where I can see
the stars. A place where a damnable street lamp does not shine through
my&amp;nbsp;blinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that my parents now have floors and wall in about 50%
of the house (yeah my own room when I go back that isn&amp;#8217;t a&amp;nbsp;closet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is that the results of the spinal tap came back and no one
knows what is wrong with my mother. Similarly, no one knows what is
wrong with my stomach, but I need a new one. All of my dreams are still
nightmares, including the wet&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, there is something to be said for these WoWDetox,
PostSecret, and GroupHug schticks&amp;#8230;Trolling is fun and entertaining;
actually posting on one would be a scandalous admission of guilt, even
if no picture is&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;#8217;t slept and the days
all blur&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me sad. He was a kind a noble spirit. The heights of cat-hood
were attained with that one. Unlike most cats he was loyal to a fault.
He came to us out of the snow in -60 weather my father&amp;#8217;s birthday in
January. As a child he would walk us to the bus stop every morning
regardless of weather. He was the only cat I have ever known that I
could teach to give me a high&amp;nbsp;five.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond all of this he was premier in his love of sport hunting.
chipmunks and other rodents were everyday fare. Birds, even doves, were
larger prey I was happy to dispose of after the feast. A gang of
raccoons stood no chance when trying to steal his meal in the cold
Hoosier wind. The bell emplaced on his neck did not cull his habits, but
rather honed his skill and carnivorous&amp;nbsp;nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was 18 years&amp;nbsp;old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All material and sentimental artefacts of my youth may and ought be
forgotten. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s memory and strength and cunning, however, has long been
part of my&amp;nbsp;psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a funk all weekend and no one saw me, though I longed to be&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in retrospect, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s passing was felt a priori. I get these
feelings sometimes. I can&amp;#8217;t ignore them, though I try. Then something
always happens. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NON&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BELIEVERS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THERE&lt;/span&gt;: This actually occurs
to me. Not that you would believe&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a well-defined man, but I have no sense of&amp;nbsp;self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to happen to me this Yom Kippur was that I lost
all internal purpose and motivation. And now this, and I just wanna be
alone; be&amp;nbsp;loved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever next the world wants to do to me, let it pass for I have no
fear nor shame. I am hardly a person at this&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally that isn&amp;#8217;t what this is for. I have had a particularly rough
Yom Kippur and the High Holy days preceding have faired little&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my chaotic life is in a constant state of change, I have been
fighting desperately lately to change for the&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as in the sermon I heard last night said, doing the right thing
does not always feel good and the temptation to do the wrong thing often
seems easier in the short&amp;nbsp;term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end I have resolved to not hate this year. To say no more evil
words. I do not fear this change, though it has caused me some strife,
in the long run it will do me&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have thrown down my weapons forged against my adversaries. I hope they
do the same, turning foe to indifferent&amp;nbsp;stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that I forgive you, and I do so all the time. I may only let you
know once a year, but with every step and with every breath it is&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may romance the man in the street, but for now I will leave him be
with his coffee, two creams, and three&amp;nbsp;sugars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life continues to collapse in on itself. The only method of survival
is to constantly rearrange and reinvent&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many tell me that change is not possible; some tell me that will to
change and the inability to do so is just part of life. I deny both of&amp;nbsp;these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In truth I am not even sure why I try anymore. Survival doesn&amp;#8217;t seem
like such a great thing all that much of the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a rather large decision today. One that has far reaching
long-term&amp;nbsp;consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the secondary and tertiary effects of this choice were
not things I anticipated and have proved very upsetting and unsettling.
Change is difficult. I know not whether any I know will notice the long
term difference. I do know I was upset greatly in the short term, but I
am glad my friends were here for me to non-specifically complain&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life continues to be a cascade of failures. I fight, but I fight
alone. I fight for myself, but I am not always&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for a Turning, but in which direction? Perhaps I will keep
spinning into&amp;nbsp;oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you knew this, but I will explain. Currently my &amp;#8220;Where do I fit
in?&amp;#8221; page yields the following&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Which I have complained about before I stand with 3/3 votes for being
funnier.&amp;nbsp;Whatevs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) I &amp;#8220;win&amp;#8221; (term used loosely) The best dancer with 2/2 votes. Frankly,
I have no idea who has even seen me dance let alone what possible
crappyness has been dredged up against&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) I apparently lost with 0/2 votes the most outgoing. I think I am
pretty damned outgoing (at times). Who are these fonts of&amp;nbsp;extrovertedness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the day in services as will be the fate of my tomorrow.
However I did finish my little book of poetry and prose which I bought.
Let me tell you it was amazing! Who would have known I would have been
so into it. There are a couple poems that stick out in my mind. One is
entitled &amp;#8220;The Chef is Delicious&amp;#8221; and the other is called&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Interview&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth be told though, I bought the book for the first short story
which is a very gripping and condensed retelling of the Odyssey. What is
rather intriguing about this version is that it totally elides the
presence of Telemachus, is told in the first person by Odysseus himself,
and contains this amazingly interesting part after where Homer leaves
off wherein Odysseus in his old age takes a crew retracing the steps of
his wanderings before returning home to die.&amp;nbsp;Amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other short story in the book and the essay as well were almost as&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It seemed odd that noone had thought of it before but in general there&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;is no accounting for the bovine stupidity of mankind.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was perfect save that she would never go with me were I the last
girl on Earth, I&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also sort of along this note, it is a bad Idea to go to the Airport when
one has not taken some time out for oneself recently. With respect to
me, this is about 36 hrs. The throughput of bodies in Airports is huge
and I always seem to find a good number of people I can imagine in
various positions and places for various lengths of time with a various
degree of emotional attachment with a various length of rope at my&amp;nbsp;disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met a man on the street today who was playing both the Kazoo and the
Ukulele. I gave this man a&amp;nbsp;dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other and final thing of note today was that I got to talk to Sean.
The following is an excerpt as related to the Super-Secret Project&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP&lt;/span&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Me: So I bought one of those robot kits that you bought Julian for his Bar Mitzvah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sean: Oh really? Cool. How far are you? What can it do?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Me: Well I got to a certain point but&amp;#8230;.I am working on a rather involved subproject that isn&amp;#8217;t in the book.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Sean: Of Course you are!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSP&lt;/span&gt; is complete I am thinking about trying my hand at writing
fiction. I wonder if I am any good at it. Maybe I could write a story
about a brave Nuclear Engineer who stands up to the world and destroys
Idaho. The clincher is that it would be written as a retelling of&amp;nbsp;Gilgamesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am totally here and Totally made it out of my talk just fine. I made a
lot of very interesting observations at the conference. I very much
meta-gamed&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to develop the persona s.t. people instantly look at me and
know (implicitly) that I am meta-gaming but have them just think of it
as an aspect of my personality and therefore not think of me as someone
trying to extort/control them, but rather as some stuffy academic whose
head is too big and can&amp;#8217;t control it and knows not what he&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cover keeps getting blown by the fact that I do know what I do. What
then confuses people though is my willingness to play the game even
after both parties have it figured&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate at which I am reinventing myself has considerably slowed down I
fear. I think my first visit to Idaho really shattered me and left a
deep cleavage in the granite of my force of&amp;nbsp;will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel so&amp;nbsp;normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think that this has ever been a problem for me before. What is
worse is that it is&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to be just some&amp;nbsp;guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the fedora helps. What awes about the hat is that it instantly
draws the eyes away from me and onto itself. More importantly it draws
the eyes away from my increasingly self-conscious stomach. That is right
folks, my abdominal area has achieved sentience and is rising up to
over-take me. Needless to say, I like the&amp;nbsp;hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People look at me and remember some man in a hat. Not a guy with a beard
or some such. It makes me feel very man-in-the-street-ish sans street
addendum&amp;nbsp;hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love is so easy to construct on&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today is quite strange. It is almost as if it was a full day of out body
experiences. Not that I am claiming that I have ever had an out of body
experience. Rather, I was more or less just observing myself.
Furthermore, being an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENTJ&lt;/span&gt;, I am very&amp;nbsp;critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#8217;t even do such things like go to the coffee shop or Japanese or
play War 3 in&amp;nbsp;peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I am freaking out over nothings. I am over-analyzing situations,
The situation. I want someone to make a state of Anthony&amp;#8217;s life speech
for me so I can&amp;nbsp;criticize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Freedom of choice&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Seems to be the rule of thumb.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may just be having an episode where I have a lot of choices. Because
of this, I feel I am not always making or have made the best choices. Or
Worse yet, had an oppurtunity to make a better choice but didn&amp;#8217;t think

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Moebius Dick!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So other than not much happening today, not much happened. However I
have made Two (2) really cool updates to my&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) I added the Protomen pictures from their Hollywood concert to my
website. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://scopatz.com/photos/index.php?album=Proto"&gt;http://scopatz.com/photos/index.php?album=Proto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) I embedded my google calender for viewing onto my website. It is
under the &amp;#8220;When&amp;#8221; tab. Basically this means that if you wanna know my
schedule, you just have to go to my website. Pretty cool huh? Accessible
via &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://scopatz.com/#When"&gt;http://scopatz.com/#When&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know would like to start a discussion though. Here is the question: Is
it manipulation of other people to change yourself based on their&amp;nbsp;actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some points to&amp;nbsp;consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is clearly social manipulation as you are part of the social
group and changing yourself has some effect not only on you but the
whole group&amp;nbsp;dynamic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does intention matter? If you change yourself merely with the
intent of changing someone else&amp;#8217;s beliefs or mannerisms, is that then
manipulation of other&amp;nbsp;people?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the contrapositive to 2 hold? Namely, is it manipulation of
the other person to change yourself based on their actions, not caring
if or not wanting the other person to&amp;nbsp;change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok that is all,&amp;nbsp;hotstuff.&lt;/p&gt;

High Sierra back country with my brothers. Many stories to tell and to
write about. However yesterday when I got back I was so depressed and
confused after trying to read two weeks worth of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LJ&lt;/span&gt; posts on my friends
page that I figured it wasn&amp;#8217;t worth&amp;nbsp;trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the trip went very well. Shane had never been backpacking
before and Julian had only been on one other short trip. They were
troopers though for the full 38 miles of it (18-19 in one day hike that
was completed in 9 hours). For the occasion I bought Shane a backpack
and Julian a Tent. We were surrounded by Kelty gear to be&amp;nbsp;sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course no trip goes off without roles. I was quick in assigning (and
picking mine first) peoples jobs. Shane was in charge of drinking
resources and iodine. Thus the nickname &amp;#8220;Water Boy&amp;#8221; was dolloped on him
with a fair share of Adam Sandler references. Julian was in charge of
time keeping and borrowed my pocket watch for the trip and was therefore
titled &amp;#8220;CronoMaster&amp;#8221; and was called by such whensoever his services were&amp;nbsp;requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The really sad thing about this trip was the Air quality. It was hazy
every direction but east. Some was caused by smoke. Most was just
pollution from the San Joaquin&amp;nbsp;Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the Santa Ynez Valley, the Zaca fire continues to blaze.
The sky was rust &amp;#8216;til two past noon today. 125k acres and $73 mil to
fight. And when you fight, you fight&amp;nbsp;alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is happening to my&amp;nbsp;planet?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feelings are best expressed&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I want to have sex; It&amp;#8217;s time to fly home.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I finished &amp;#8220;the Golden Compass&amp;#8221; today. It is definitely one of the
best kids books I have ever read. The story is fast and engaging and
follows a complicated plot as seen from a very convincing childlike&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real reason this book is a feat is that the main character (in
fantasy terms) has one and only one special ability. The singularness of
it is not what is amazing, but rather what it is. Her special ability as
far as I can tell is that she is a compulsive and convincing&amp;nbsp;liar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&amp;#8217;t really strike one as something that would be all that
helpful, but it turns out that the way she uses this tactic over and
over again is done with extreme deft and care. Also it is quite odd to
think of a hero as someone so weaselly without actually being an&amp;nbsp;anti-hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to picking up the next book in the trilogy even though I
may not do it immediately. I am in 3R and just bought a book that I have
been eying for a few years now. This one is called &amp;#8220;Conifers of
California&amp;#8221;. It is a very pretty and informative illustrated manual. Odd
the coffee table here we keep a collection of books about the trees in
the park and I am going to add this one to it. I, of course, have read
them all cover to cover but the rule is that I have to read them while
in Three Rivers. I probably should tick off all of the trees in there
that I have personally seen in the wild. Better yet, it would be neat to
take pictures with me by each one of them. This would be quite the feat
since some of them are quite remote and rare, like my favorite tree in
the world: the Foxtail pine. it lives only above 8,500 feet and there
are only two small region where they grow, separated by 300 miles or
something. Most people that see them don&amp;#8217;t even know what they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than all of that I am chilling in Visalia while my parents pick up
supplies. I did some work for my adviser, which could have taken a while
but I managed to alter some previous code and bust it out real quick.
Teh&amp;nbsp;sw33t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#8217;t look like Sean will go backpacking with us&amp;#8230;and it also
doesn&amp;#8217;t look like we&amp;#8217;ll be able to go rafting with&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This funny thing happened, but you had to be there. I was&amp;nbsp;^_^&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) The Zaca Fire: Where I am staying right now, at my parents, there is
a huge fire in the back country that had a big surge today. It has been
burning for a month and will burn for another as estimates project. The
sky was an unnatural red from all of the ash that covered a half-space
of the sky. I went outside today and all of the colors where surreal and
off. The trees where a disturbingly darker green. All of the browns of
dirt and dried grass were red-fuchsia. Shadows, rather than being black,
where a deep maroon. My skin was weired jaundice and sunburned color.
The sky was a fabulous yellow and red and brown and pink. My mother is
praying for our house to burn, but the winds are blowing wrong. The
house of Shaitan is&amp;nbsp;close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Gantz: My cousin told me he had seen this anime&amp;#8217;s first couple of
episodes at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AX&lt;/span&gt; and that it was wacky. I just finished all of it today
after starting it 36 hours before. It is amazing. Basically, selected
people who die instead of whatever else happening they get transported
to a room with essentially a sphere of annihilation in it. The sphere
starts making playing old exercise music before explaining the night&amp;#8217;s
hunt to all of the new and (few) returning players. Players get an hour
to be set free inside of a 1 km^2 region of Tokyo where they try to hunt
specific aliens. Those who survive are healed and then get to live
normally until the next game&amp;nbsp;date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you know the gimmick, I&amp;#8217;ll explain why it is cool. Let&amp;#8217;s start
with the fact that I think there are Two (2) main reasons for watching
anime: 1) Superior Art, it is aesthetically pleasing to look at in
traditional and experimental senses, 2) Long running, contiguous story
lines typically with adult and socially meaningful themes. Both of these
reasons are, for me, what distinguishes anime from other cartoon
production. That being said, I didn&amp;#8217;t find the art in Gantz to be
particularly great. I am not really a fan of the new style, computer
made stuff anyways. The story line rocks though. Unlike Eva, which
breezes through the battles quickly, in 26 episodes only 4 games were
run. It was much more like Slayers where there are these epic battles
that go on like 4-5 shows&amp;#8230;when you think about this it is an hour
long+ battle sequence. The Characters are similarly developed. Also the
special abilities of the aliens were exceptional and expected. I&amp;#8217;ll put
it this way, the fights (at least all but the first) were ridiculously
hard. Very very very much worth seeing. Very high on the violence and
language count, which allowed them to make the most natural Shaft
reference anywhere anytime. The male main character named Kei did
something stupid and cool and then one of the back ups said &amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s one
bad mother.&amp;#8221; and the other, frustrated because they were under fire,
said &amp;#8220;Shut your&amp;nbsp;mouth!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Because of Gantz and the Fire I had this dream last night where I was
systematically killing off all of the captains of the Enterprise in
order. Even people who were only acting captains. I killed Kirk, then I
got Picard with a nerf gun/football-thing in the mouth from the window
of a moving vehicle. I then got Ricker and then Data. I forgot Troi so I
will have to go back for her tonight. Then I got the Quantum leap guy
from Enterprise. I don&amp;#8217;t normally have dreams I like (I only have
nightmares), and while this was horrific, I found it amazingly&amp;nbsp;satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) I&amp;#8217;ll say this because it needs reiterating. I thought I was crazy for
liking Protomen. It is sweetness in my heart to know there are others.
Let this city burn through the&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am off to Three Rivers, catch you on the Kaweah or on the Flip&amp;nbsp;side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt; in Irvine with Andrew.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2) The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROTOMEN&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to play in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LARP&lt;/span&gt; with Andrew in Irvine. I played Razza as most
of the others were Silver Dawn Chars. The game was interesting and well
run. The idea was that we were ported to some demi plane with a room
with a bunch of artifacts on the second floor. If we took these
artifacts downstairs, the items would activate and fun stuff would
happen. I died. Trying to save people. And then was revived so no harm,
no&amp;nbsp;foul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I was playing Razza, and the distinct lack of anything to hit or
any clear enemy made it not really my forte. However, in typical Razza
fashion I did crazy and silly things that moved the game forward with
out anyone really realizing the accomplishment. Not really understanding
the idea of an artifact, I talked with everything that could talk. I
found a humanoid statue that had a lovely personality that told me they
could combine magical things. Being bored and wanting more death I took
him downstairs to start combining ad&amp;nbsp;nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, personally, figured out the key to getting out of the demi plane
(combining three magic tables) a couple of hours before it was done in
game by other players and only after several hints from the GMs. I
didn&amp;#8217;t tell anyone else, because hey! It&amp;#8217;s Razza. It wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been
a high priority for him and other &amp;#8220;more qualified&amp;#8221; individuals had taken
over the magic combining fun. Very tough &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RP&lt;/span&gt; session for Razza. But that
is why I like him so much. He almost never does what I would do, but it
has come to be exactly what everyone expects him to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin&amp;#8217;s new girlfriend, Kerry3, had heard of Razza only as &amp;#8220;That
Monk&amp;#8221;. Have I told you how superb that&amp;nbsp;is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the Protomen go&amp;#8230;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMG&lt;/span&gt; they rocked my&amp;nbsp;lobster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were so good. Their opener, the Megas, were pretty good to. They
played almost all songs that were ballads from the perspective of the
different bosses. Really neat. I hadn&amp;#8217;t heard of them before but will
have to buy their album when it comes out. Awesome prep for what was to
come and it was even cooler that they joined in among our ranks for the&amp;nbsp;Protomen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Protomen played their album basically straight through. This was
expected since it is a rock opera. The Protoman helmet had a microphone
built into it, which *is* the coolest thing I have&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the most orgasmic, auto-destructive thing I have ever seen is when
they played &amp;#8220;Unrest in the House of Light&amp;#8221;. The song goes through pulses
where it is slow and Dr. Light is addressing Megaman and then where the
guitar takes over and the place falls apart, and each time the guitar
takes over the situation is a little more extreme than before. This was
echoed by the audience fully. The band had complete control over this
savage&amp;nbsp;beast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was nice to know that I am not the only one who knows all of their
lyrics and blasts their sound in my car melting faces whither I&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all the concert was and amazing experience. Anyone and everyone
who is in Austin should, need, and, must go to their show in Austin.

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t wait to see them again someday and now I really am excited for
Nightwish (which we are all going to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt;). Because as far away and lame
as Tennessee is, Finland is much farther and a poor second to Belgium
when going&amp;nbsp;abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry Prime once said something to be about respecting and liking the
disconnect between the social climber, businessman sort of persona who
is really into punk&amp;nbsp;music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope rides&amp;nbsp;alone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which bring up an interesting point. Growing up I used to look really
effeminate and was made fun of on this front all the time. Which was why
I was so pleased to have facial hair. Then in college I shaved for a
brief time and within a couple of weeks I was getting &amp;#8220;Excuse me Miss&amp;#8221;.
The beard came&amp;nbsp;back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder how well I could shake the drag thing again. I&amp;#8217;ll need to

&lt;p&gt;We watched the Rutles movie tonight. My body is modifying itself in
strange and disappointing ways. I feel really healthy and my blood
pressure is 92 over 59 with a pulse of 62. The pressure is fantastically
low. I feel my pulse could be a bit lower. Shane&amp;#8217;s pulse was 53, but his
pressure was&amp;nbsp;high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211;Break&amp;#8211;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I just had a big argument with my mom. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; was showing some
monkeys that were being used in some sort of lab experiment. She said
that the monkeys shouldn&amp;#8217;t be tested&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Let this be said right now&amp;#8230;I have nut political views, a lot of
them in fact. One of them I think is that I really believe in science
and economics. Whether this extends to what would be called faith or not
I do not yet&amp;nbsp;know&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I made the argument to my mom that 1) most biologists and doctors
would rather not use the animals and where ever they can develop methods
that don&amp;#8217;t 2) animal testing has saved lives in the past, saves lives
now, and will save lives in the future and has improved life expectancy
otherwise, 3) animal testing in needed to develop methods that don&amp;#8217;t use
animals as we ramp up the tech&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She still wasn&amp;#8217;t buying it so I ended up pointing out the she either
values animals as much or more than people -&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt;- that she is essentially
a Christian&amp;nbsp;Scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sort of agreed to disagree and then mentioned as long as she didn&amp;#8217;t
join &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PETA&lt;/span&gt; or firebomb research clinics then we&amp;#8217;d be&amp;nbsp;cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of Course she mentions that she was thinking about joining&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PETA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is where things got weird. Neither her or my dad believed me
when I said that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PETA&lt;/span&gt; euthanizes their rescued animals. Of course I
didn&amp;#8217;t have enough time to show her this website:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/30/EDGC9DGTNV1.DTL"&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/30/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDGC9DGTNV1&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this is the San Fransisco Chronicle, which is supposedly the most
liberal newspaper in the nation, who you&amp;#8217;d think would be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PETA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sticks in my craw about all of this is that I feel it is another
expression of people feeling guilty about themselves or humanity
altering the environment. Naturally, this comes up a lot in power
generation biz that I am&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a guy who is really into systems and system dynamics generally the
way complex behavior functions, it really always amazes me to see how
little of a given problem people can see and still be wholly holy
warriors for their cause. I think very few people in this country really
understand where electricity comes from in this country. E.g. Electric
and Hybrid vehicles are all the range in California, a state that lives
on coal and natural&amp;nbsp;gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I am not saying that every little bit doesn&amp;#8217;t help, and yes animals
need activates too to argue for better, more humane treatment where ever
it is&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These issues are&amp;nbsp;complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately raw emotion won&amp;#8217;t solve them. Also, merely by being alive
every single person effects the environment in adverse ways. If one
really feels guilty enough about these things than the most honorable
thing one could do is suicide. Killing yourself is likely the best thing
someone can do to return the world to its otherwise natural&amp;nbsp;state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revolution is coming and I want to live to feel a face that isn&amp;#8217;t
mine. Seeya in Three&amp;nbsp;Rivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

Anchorage, Alaska where her family had moved. Always ready to paint or
travel she choose to study at the University of the Americas in Mexico
City, where to her surprise she stayed for 20 years. During that time
becoming an English Teacher in her children&amp;#8217;s school was her next career
goal. Painting had to wait. In 1990 she moved with her children away
from the problems of the big city and settled in the little village of
Cabo San Lucas, Baja California. Now there was time to paint and travel.
Her first works were Diego Rivera style portraits where the many years
lived in Mexico showed through with bright warm colors. Eight years went
by in Cabo and her children grew up and started families of their own.
One of her daughters married and moved to Santa Ynez and as visits began
so did the urge to return to the United&amp;nbsp;States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a resident of Santa Ynez she enjoys painting this beautiful valley
and its wonderful oaks. Local landmarks such as old barns, windmills and
churches are in many of her latest works. The many years spent in Mexico
are seen through the warm bright colors in her&amp;nbsp;landscapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Jenny has a terminal and debilitating disease known
commonly as Papermill Vagina. No known cure or cause has yet been found.
However, with your help and the purchase of one of her paintings, more
monies can be dedicated to easing Jenny&amp;#8217;s pain and go toward researching
this rare and awful condition. Up to now, Jenny has learned to cope with
her struggles by occasionally using her disease in her art. Once a
month, her vulva swallows one of the beautiful Santa Ynez Valley live
oaks and she makes a unique canvas out of it. On this canvas she paints
her landscapes in warm bright colors. Won&amp;#8217;t you&amp;nbsp;help?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;What do you call a River Rafting guide without a girlfriend?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Homeless.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a lot has happened since I last checked in. I believe that the
last issue was about &amp;#8220;The Godless Girl&amp;#8221; which puts this at a full week&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than explain in detail the joyous occasions I had in the Bay Area
(I am anxious to talk about the juicy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; tidbits) I will sum up my
further &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; travel by recounting this conversion between Kerry Prime and&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Me: It seems to me that the type of people into watersports are also the type of people into watersports.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Kerry: You really need to be around more.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerry also had some amusing anecdotes about Asians in the woods, but
we&amp;#8217;ll save those for another&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soooooooooooooooooo This weekend was&amp;nbsp;amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like&amp;nbsp;amazingawsomefunburgerw/cheeseLOLtehsw33tpimpmyridemtvamazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went down to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt; for my friend from high school Meenon&amp;#8217;s birthday
party. However, my cousin Andrew basically begged me to meet him in the
Valley before going to the&amp;nbsp;party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went to see Andrew and friends. It also happened to be Twiny&amp;#8217;s
Birthday. Twiny&amp;#8217;s real name is either Kerry, Kari, or Carrie but is
known as such since she is effectively Mowi&amp;#8217;s twin. I had never met her
before&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out Twiny is awesome and just moved out from Key Largo and owns&amp;nbsp;ferrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I don&amp;#8217;t say this enough, I&amp;#8217;ll say it now and again. I really love
everyone in my cousins greater friend group. They have been good friends
and true throughout the&amp;nbsp;ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, totally calmly while we were having dinner at the
Cheesecake Factory, Kai (who was sitting across from me)&amp;nbsp;asked,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;So how is&amp;nbsp;Shaitan?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I busted up laughing and then offered to settle this outside. Ok, I
lied. Kai didn&amp;#8217;t say Shaitan, but rather something quite close. (Hint:
It wasn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;Shaihulud)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately because of the Twiny festivities, I did not get to
socialize with Kari (Andrew&amp;#8217;s new attachment) as much as I was hoping /&amp;nbsp;planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meenon&amp;#8217;s party was most righteous and filled with hedonistic delights
Shaitan would have been proud of. I&amp;nbsp;partook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, The real reason for this&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so happy this visit to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;. There was so much love and warmth that
flowed through people among both, rather disparate groups. The
similarities were staggering and fulfilling. The old friends had nothing
lost between us and the new friends gains were so subtly accepted that
there was no, none, Zero awkwardness between us after the initial
introduction. I felt totally at ease with these newcomers even though I
know nothing about&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now here is what I noticed. Both of these groups are also a lot more
tactile than either the Bay Area or Texas crowd and certainly more so
than the ever distant Santa Barbara&amp;nbsp;crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think all of the touching and hugging and dancing and wrestling has a
lot to do with&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be utterly fair, my first hug with Twiny was somewhat awkward.
However, when I had to leave early from *her* b-day celebrations to go
to my other engagement, Twiny got up and gave me an enthusiastic hug on
her own volition. It was clear my presence was appreciated even by
someone who had only gotten into town weeks&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Kai started to undress me in the Cheesecake Factory. This was
superseded only by where I was undressed later that evening&amp;nbsp;^_-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Judy was a daughter of Godlessness&amp;#8230;Bob was a son of the Gospel&amp;#8230;Intolerance versus Intolerance.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8212;Intertitle for the Godless Girl&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This movie was one of the hottest films I have ever seen. So first off
it was amazing. Last year I also saw a film that became one of my
favorites called &amp;#8220;Girl with the Hat Box&amp;#8221;. That one was this hilarious
Russian&amp;nbsp;slapstick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Godless Girl&amp;#8221; is a Cecil B. DeMille flick and based on this one
films of his, I think I am a fan. Probably not in the way he was
meaning, but there really were some amazing shots (like the cut away of
the school house riot) that were chaotic and&amp;nbsp;gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is why the movie was so sexy though other than all of the actresses
being cute to hot. Most of it took place in a &amp;#8220;Reform School&amp;#8221; which was
essentially a prison. One side was boys and the other side was&amp;nbsp;girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite (read hedonisticly satisfying) is when the godless
girl Judy is being inducted into the prison and they forcibly cut her
hair. Now, her hair already only barely touched her ear lobes. The funny
part of the story is hat at first she doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to know what is
going on and sits down and asks Mame, the hair dresser, to style it a
particular way. Mame proceeds to cut just a huge part off of the top and
Judy&amp;#8217;s face drops. At the end of the ensuing physical struggle Judy has
this wild and unplanned, unorganized hair. It is like some black
mountain range jetting out in any direction the wind has shaped the
rock. Judy becomes an untouchable Daphne, at least until her hair grows
back out&amp;nbsp;some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the uniforms are amazingly&amp;nbsp;sexy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience itself was amazing. They would boo and hiss or laugh at
every intolerant Chirstian thing the Bob character said and they would
cheer whenever anyone from the Junior Atheist club did something&amp;nbsp;heroic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie was simply epic and you should really see&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophically, even though the movie was made with a Christian tone,
the Atheists were only anti-Christian. Now this is very interesting
because all devout Atheists that I know or know of that actively espouse
and proselytize their beliefs are essentially anti-Christian and never
or rarely seem to address other theistic belief systems that to me
personally make more sense. So as not to name friends, Penn Jillete is
one of these. Now you can say we are in America so it is the topical
group to fight against. But as a coherent philosophy, this is really
only saying their is no Christian god. Now before I get off track an go
on a logic using rant about the things that bother me about the modern
Atheist movement, I&amp;#8217;ll make my point. Most of the time I think Atheist
project themselves exclusively (or nearly so) as anti-Christians, where
as in &amp;#8220;the Godless Girl&amp;#8221; a Christian was portraying them as&amp;nbsp;anti-Christian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many things I have forgotten. But like muscle memory, I
have snapped back into place. However, I have a new perspective on this
place. It is like I am foreigner. Not a tourist, just a&amp;nbsp;foreigner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to say that if I was forced to live in a city, the city of my
choosing would be San Fransisco. Coming back I realize that, sans
weather, Austin is&amp;nbsp;perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENOUGH&lt;/span&gt;! Time to stop blathering and get down to the&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this story is the greatest story ever told, to me,&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to Berkeley last night at about 6 pm. Tommy and I went to the city
to try to get into a club to see a band but the venue was small and
wouldn&amp;#8217;t have made it in. We eat dinner and come back to Berkeley and go
to this bar called &amp;#8220;Raleigh&amp;#8221; I think and get drunk, as it seems I always
do when I go to&amp;nbsp;Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bar Tommy met up with one of his coworkers named Brendan. So this
guy is a friend of a friend kinda deal. Now his friend, Evan, was also
there. And Even walks around with the greatest story I have ever heard,
yesterday (Now keep in mind that I was in the car for 12 hours prior to
that and listening to nothing but the Penn Jillete radio show podcasts,
so I had heard a lot of good stories that&amp;nbsp;day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evan is from Alabama though you wouldn&amp;#8217;t know it. Now he would take his
car to this one body and mechanic shop out there. Apparently all of the
workers would make jokes and make fun of their boss, the owner about
&amp;#8220;having relations&amp;#8221; with sheep. Now the owner is otherwise a regular guy.
Wife and three kids sort of package deal. Finally, Even asked one day
about the sheep&amp;nbsp;jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shop owner took Evan in the back room of the shop and showed him
these boots that he had welded together that were specially made to keep
a sheep&amp;#8217;s hind legs secure &amp;#8220;so they can&amp;#8217;t run&amp;nbsp;away.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that isn&amp;#8217;t bad enough for you, the owner went on to explain how to do
the deed he liked taking the sheep out to the edge of a cliff to have
his way with them. He would face the sheep out over the edge of the
cliff and approach them from behind. This way the sheep would be too
scared to run away and whenever they would get a glimpse over the edge
they would frantically back up into his person. Apparently, this
increased the&amp;nbsp;pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if his wife ever let him on the boots and pretend she was
livestock&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before I go, I will take pictures of that stupid statue of the Ten

have the cable for the digital camera here so it must wait until I get
back to&amp;nbsp;California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My itinerary is roughly that I will be going to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLC&lt;/span&gt; by tomorrow night.
On Saturday I will meet up with my mother in Reno for lunch. Saturday
night I am gonna go into he city to go to a show with Tommy and then
crash at his place. Sunday night I will be seeing one of the silent film
festival shows, and then need to find a place to stay. Also someone
please go to the movie with&amp;nbsp;me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in summary, I hate this place and I am&amp;nbsp;leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this marks my last day at this nice coffee house. Makes me kinda
sad in some sense. With any luck I won&amp;#8217;t ever be back though. Some of
the only reasonable people I have met in this state frequent or work&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Why are cryptographers annoying to go on car trips with?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;They have a map, but they&amp;#8217;ll never stop and ask for directions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for the Bay Area are&amp;nbsp;forming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like I will be able to go to the San Fransisco Silent Film
Festival again this year! How cool is that?! I am thinking about going
to the last show on Sunday night called &amp;#8220;Godless Girl&amp;#8221; which is about a
Atheist girl in high school who gets into fights with one of her
Jesus-freak classmates. And get this, they both get sent to reform
school as&amp;nbsp;punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone wants to go with me I would be way&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on Saturday, it looks like I am going to stop in Reno to have lunch
with meine Muti, who will amazingly be on vacation&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my life is about to see the loss of a very important
Buddha Bed. This is my foam fold out mattress. I am going to have to
throw it away since it is all fucking moldy from this shitty apartment.
Oh well, it saves me from the $50 shipping&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Zen Joke:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;What did Harry Potter spend all of his boxing money on?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Ballet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been on my mind for about a week now because once I realized it
I was really delighted and also sickened and then enamored with the
genius of Frank&amp;nbsp;Herbert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that I have dropped the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FH&lt;/span&gt; name I know I ave lost at least half
of&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok here is the deal. We all know (all of us still reading that is) that
Lady Jessica is the not-so-love child of Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
Mohiam and Baron Vladimir&amp;nbsp;Harkonnen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a lot is in a name in Dune. Frank Herbert admitted that he chose the
name Gesserit because it sounds like Jesuit. Furthermore, there are
other examples like the fremen Jamis, which sounds oddly like Janus.
Furthermore Jamis can be said to be two-faced since he is wrong about
Paul and Jessica in life but his death justifies their further living.
Hell, even fremen is a thinly disguised &amp;#8220;free&amp;nbsp;men&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok back to our Reverend Mother. I believe that she, too, is an&amp;nbsp;Atreides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my&amp;nbsp;proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with recall your Ancient Greek and remember that Atreides
literally means &amp;#8220;Son of Atreus&amp;#8221;. As such, Atreides is a commonly used
epithet in the Iliad and the Odyssey describing Atreus&amp;#8217; sons. Namely the
heros Agamemnon and&amp;nbsp;Menelaus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, whether you know it or not the Atreides of Dune claim to be direct
male descendents of Atreus. Clearly then they are either from Menelaus
or&amp;nbsp;Agamemnon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say Agamemnon was kind of a shitty&amp;nbsp;father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Menelaus however was the right and proper husband&amp;nbsp;of&amp;#8230;.Helen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is right, Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam shares not just a
family name of the Atreides but arguably one of the most important
Atreides names. Furthermore, it is well established the Atreides hand
down names from generation to generation (eg&amp;nbsp;Leto).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more so, Gaius is a Roman name. Frank Herbert is playing a game in
that the Greeks and Greek thought essentially became the&amp;nbsp;Romans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for her last name, Mohiam&amp;#8217;s mother was probably Atreides herself and
Bene Gesserit to boot. Her mother however was ordered to mate with a
male from some other blood line. Mohaim is not known to have ever&amp;nbsp;married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is weird about&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this implies that the Bene Gesserit interbreeding between Atreides
and Harkonnen was going on much more than the one generation. They
wanted Paul who was both A and H to be female to wed with Feyd-Rautha.
However, if Gaius Helen Mohiam was also Atreides, then Lady Jessica was
also both A and H and she married Duke Leto and bore Paul! This is two
generations of first cousins marrying that we know&amp;nbsp;of!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, Frank Herbert is a sick but amazing bastard that rox my&amp;nbsp;sox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure you are all glad to know that I finished rereading Dune, so
*maybe* I will stop talking about&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through not getting the Zen Joke, you get&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

In response to other tagging: If you always spell always &amp;#8220;allways&amp;#8221;
you will always be a&amp;nbsp;retard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went camping this weekend in the Grand Teton and Yellowstone
National Parks. I&amp;#8217;d never&amp;nbsp;been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a god experience though I had some problems initially.
I stayed both nights in Grand Tetons. To list the&amp;nbsp;problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Ok so Tetons was ridiculously commercial for a National Park. There
were at least three full blown resorts that you could stay at inside of
the park boundaries that were privately owned and operated. Needless to
say this increased the price f my campsite to $17 a night. Apparently
this is because there are weird laws that grandfather out the land use
rights of the&amp;nbsp;park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) As a consequence of 1 motor boats were allowed on the lakes, to the
point of even allowing jet&amp;nbsp;skis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Because of 1 and 2, Yellowstone, even with its increased popularity,
was almost more&amp;nbsp;pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) I went up a hike in the Tetons that left from my campground and went
to the top of Signal Mountain. It was a good 3 miler each way. Nice Day
hike. But I get to the top and see all these people and a paved walkway.
It turns out you could have driven to the top. Rather than being alone,
I was surrounded by people who refused to walk even all of the way down
the path to get the best&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) The places looked so canonical that they were almost uninteresting
because of it. I know this is a strange complaint/observation. Tetons
looked *exactly* like you would expect so much so that it could be
said to have lacked an alluring character. You have already been there
in every book or picture of a mountainous wooded lake. Now to be fair
this was only in the part of the park that I was able to explore in my
limited time there. If I had been able to go&amp;nbsp;backpacking&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) One of the supporting points that really freaked me out was that none
of the trees really breached the 30-40 foot mark on average. Now being
from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; where the trees are 8-10x this size in the regions I tromp
around, a 30 ft tree is more like a nice friend than a monstrous
reminder of your&amp;nbsp;humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) Also my minds eye of a forest contains many gigantic boulders
everywhere. Their absence left me&amp;nbsp;altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) The first night I got there was the first night it had rained in a
month. And here I was thinking that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have to put on my fly and
could look at the stars all&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is all of my complaints. They really are beautiful places.
They are worth exploring. However, I was fully aware of the time I would
have and this was clearly not sufficient. If I had 8 weeks or so, I
might feel I had accomplished what I wanted in the&amp;nbsp;parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I basically went because I knew that if I didn&amp;#8217;t take this
opportunity I would never forgive&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Yellowstone I went to see a couple of geysers and the canyon. Old
Faithful was, of course, on the list. More interestingly I saw on the
map a place I had to go to. It drew me in. There is Lone Star Geyser in
Yellowstone. It is a 2.4 mile hike out to it which meant that there were
relatively few people on the trail. Unfortunately here were relatively
more people on the trail since it was&amp;nbsp;paved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, however, was happy for its asphalted quality and I&amp;#8217;ll tell you why. I
played fast and loose with this trip and for my day excursion up to
Yellowstone I forgot my hiking boots back at base camp and had only my
sandals. However, I wasn&amp;#8217;t about to go to Yellowstone and not doing any
hiking so I toughened it up and decided to go as I was. Stupid, yes. But
lucky too since amazingly the trail I picked was&amp;nbsp;paved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I ever go back? Probably. These aren&amp;#8217;t my first choice for parks to
visit but I think it is good every once in awhile to be put out of your
natural&amp;nbsp;element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, It was kind of sad to have gone camping alone. I haven&amp;#8217;t been
by myself sine I lived in Los Alamos. I enjoyed it, but it was clear I
am solo-camper out of practice. Thankfully I reverted quickly back into
all of the lone hiker crazy practices like talking to one&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Leaving Idaho soon,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Leaving Duncan soon.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A pretty gohla is like a pretty gohla.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8211;The Magnetic Fields, almost&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;What is wrong with this country is that when given the choice more people in this country would rather talk about the draft than breasts.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8212;Penn Jillette&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went and walked around the river where the fireworks were held last
night for the 4th of July. Initially I went just to do some data
collection about the populous of this &amp;#8220;great&amp;#8221; state. I figured it would
be a good opportunity to see a good cross-section of society&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is American; everyone like watching shit git blown up. (On a
side note I was likely the only person in the country and therefore the
world listening to Nightwish while watching fireworks last night and it
was a&amp;nbsp;blast!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data collection was useful. but nothing that you couldn&amp;#8217;t really
guess with the exception that I saw about 6% Asian females. I saw no
Asian descendant males. The fun part is what I started doing&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to start staring directly into peoples eyes as I walked by. If
they held my gaze I would try to stare them down as long as they were
within sight. Here is what I&amp;nbsp;learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people didn&amp;#8217;t even notice that you were looking at them. Most
people who noticed would quickly look away or flicker their eyes in a
different&amp;nbsp;direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those few who would hold your gaze most were female. Of the men that
would hold, almost all would not go out of their way. They would stare
at me back only as long as it was convenient. Some of the women however,
would move their head and follow me to keep looking. These women went
out of their way to lock eyes. Sometimes they (the women) would be
seamlessly be carrying on a conversation while doing this. I was&amp;nbsp;impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to degrade men too wholly in this exercise, there was one guy who
was amazing. He was standing in one place but was doing the same thing I
was! When our eyes met we both held steady until I was almost past at
which point we both realized what the other was doing. He smiled and
gave the canonical &amp;#8220;sup&amp;#8221; head nod. I smirked and responded with a head
jerk of my own. That man is deserving of&amp;nbsp;praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about this that I noticed is that man who had were
either hanging on fly babes or had their ilk clinging to them were more
likely to return the stare. However, they would also very nervously look
away almost immediately. I can&amp;#8217;t deny that this wasn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lest you think I was only picking on those weaker than me I tried to
stare down people larger and stronger than me. I even starred down a
cop. He was pussyfooting around the business I was bringing to his
table. I am certain that in a different situation this defender of law&amp;#8217;s
personality would have shown through a bit&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this were any measurement of humanity, most people would have&amp;nbsp;failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this wasn&amp;#8217;t a fair test since they did not know they were
being&amp;nbsp;tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a big crowd sometime and try this. It is&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure there are many theories for this behavior, but I won&amp;#8217;t go into
them. My purpose is to gain an intuition about people&amp;#8217;s behavior in
order to psuedo-predict it in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another data point, another link in the thought&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8212;Trey Parker &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Matt Stone, Pearl Harbor Song, Team America: World Police&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quote above, as funny as it is, is Completely&amp;nbsp;true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw &amp;#8220;Transformers&amp;#8221; last&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to preface this. Yesterday started off wonderful and ended
Awful. Job was being channeled pretty hard. It started off by me going
rafting on the snake which was a lot of fun. It ended with me realizing
that the garage I left my car at had scratched my car on the passengers
side and I drove off with out realizing it and with my apartment
flooding in about an inch of&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went to see &amp;#8220;Transformers&amp;#8221;. I wanted to watch some pretend violence
to relieve some of this frustration and I had already seen &amp;#8220;Live Free or
Die&amp;nbsp;Hard&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, &amp;#8220;Transformers&amp;#8221; was terrible. There I said it. Now this doesn&amp;#8217;t mean
you shouldn&amp;#8217;t go see&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, if they did everything else in the movie wrong what was done
correctly with an amazing clarity of purpose was movement. The
filmmakers captured the fluidity of movement of the autobots superbly.
In some sense, this is the entire point of the Transformers story. The whole
point is that there are these huge mechanical constructs but these ease
with which the artefacts are able to alter their very shape is
astonishing. It is even more impressive and shocking since they take the
form of objects that are, if not stationary, quite rigid&amp;nbsp;typically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they captured the basic element. However, all other elements of the
movie were bad to physically painful. For example, the script. If the
script were dropped on the Iran they&amp;#8217;d stop their enrichment program
from brain damage. Unfortunately, when airlifted into Idaho, the
populous beacame&amp;nbsp;smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most stories, the main characters were not the most badass. This
blows goats since they are the damn Transformers and should be sweet as
hell and make you sticky as honey. Optimus Prime wasn&amp;#8217;t even kinda&amp;nbsp;cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The support characters were all much much better. Bubble Bee rocked the
house, The main female lead was as amazing as all get out. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Air
Force squad were the most badass humans in the movie as they took down
Two (2) Decepticons without any&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually brings me to an interesting point. Almost all stories
have the coolest characters take a backseat or adversarial role. This is because there is a perceived
method by which the coolest people somehow take away from having a main
character who has some hardship to&amp;nbsp;overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some Examples: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YT&lt;/span&gt; and Raven are waaaay cooler than Hiro in &amp;#8220;Snowcrash&amp;#8221;.
Escaflone just kills off Balgus immediately (which is reason enough to
stop watching). Any Final Fantasy game. Anything in a horror genre has
to satisfy this sans maybe Army of Darkness. Star Wars: Luke is one
pansy ass&amp;nbsp;mofo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions to this rule and these exceptions are dear to
my&amp;nbsp;heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ancient world certainly function in this self-deprecating way. All
of the Heros like Beowulf, Gilgamesh and Heracles are far and wide the
most badass, most hardcore people around. Foxy Brown from the
blaxplotation film by the same name starring Pam Geiger. And of course&amp;nbsp;Dune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dune, Paul is the most powerful and smartest character in the entire
universe. To that end he literally starts off basically with his mom in
the desert and then becomes a Benevolent Dictator for Life. No one in
the Dune universe can beat&amp;nbsp;Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you were right, this was an elaborate excuse to talk about how
awesome Dune is. However I did get to point out that Micheal Bay really
made something that could have been good and campy and turned it into
something that was bad and crappy in part because of the fact that not
even Optimus Prime was noticeably heroic. He seemed more like a soldier
following orders. I pray they don&amp;#8217;t make a&amp;nbsp;sequel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was always more of a He-man kid&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 4th of&amp;nbsp;July!&lt;/p&gt;

By this, of course, was the process by which naming something gave this
person power over said things. In this case, if I remember and
understood clearly, the objects being named were&amp;nbsp;emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person claims that the naming of certain emotions grated the
ability to not Hate. The observational morsel that this all leads up to
is that this ability was viewed as a positive quality by the unsaid&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The personage and the situation in which this all arose are not of
importance to about half of the readership here and the other half might
simply find it quaint should they care. Therefore the basis for the
problem which I now present has been given in the most fundamental&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quandary: Is there a justification for Hate? Is Hate one of those
emotions that exists only to be conquered? Is the mastery of Hate one of
those properties by which ones own humanity may be&amp;nbsp;measured?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveat: I am not sure any of the questions proposed above are indeed the
question. They may in fact merely beat around some central question.
Therefore the point of this may be to find what the central question&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I will start out by admitting my humanity. I hate people. Certain
people. These are people I have met and those I have never known. I
shan&amp;#8217;t name them; that would be&amp;nbsp;rude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been taught not to hate. I have been taught that hate is a
strong word, maybe the strongest. I have been taught not to use it&amp;nbsp;lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the most beautiful things about this country (which I
Love by the way) is the implicit right to Hate. In the United States you
can hate anyone or anything. This is guaranteed by the philosophy that
thought crimes should be illegal. Even, treasonous thought crimes should
be illegal. (though this is a bit off topic, treasonous though crimes
should be illegal because the only method to defeat them is through
allowing them. If you allow people to hate the country you show them
that the government is better than they could have imagined because of
this benevolence. Oppressing hateful beliefs towards the state only
inflames them. Better to let the kindling burn itself&amp;nbsp;out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can tell me, as a citizen, how to feel. Now, expressing some of
these beliefs publically (especially if untrue) may be defamatory, and
that would be illegal. But I can&amp;nbsp;Hate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like with any right afforded me, I will not throw it out nor piss on it.
I treat this assumed right the same way I do voting. I am therefore very
selective in my hate. My hate is hard to&amp;nbsp;earn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosophically, I am allied with Dante quite closely on some issues.
Specifically I believe that betrayal is the absolute worst act one may
commit against a fellow human. As I think about it this is because
active betrayal is the first step to a series of other crimes. Being
Jewish, there is a mostly historical political movement you can guess I
Hate. My great grandfather fought valiantly in the Great War for the
Germans for God&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people in my time whom I Hate are not in a position where Name Magic
is going to subdue my hate. I have named the causes. I have named the
effects. I have this power over the situation. I consciously choose my
Hate over all other options. I daresay even that Hate was the best
solution to a most bothersome&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So mayhaps the situations for me and my friend are different. I have
clearly chosen Hate while this person is trying to avoid it. Now here is
what I do not understand: the avoidance of Hate. I feel that morally, in
their shoes, Hate could be justified (from what I know). This person my
be avoiding Hate thus because it is more comfortable to not hate. This
isn&amp;#8217;t a bad reason. If the situation doesn&amp;#8217;t require it, then humans
should be allowed to pick the manner in which they live their own&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also it might be seen that Hate could hinder this situation. Information
is always more important to have than ease of emotion. If Hate would
inhibit the gathering of data then it could be deemed prudent to not do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have babbled on for a while, it is important to restate the
question. Hate was being avoided to gather more information which
manifested as Name Magic. This Name Magic gave power over Hate. However,
once the Name Magic is obtained what reason is there to still pursue the
avoidance of&amp;nbsp;Hate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would claim that there is no compelling reason to avoid Hate once one
has power over it. One could keep avoiding it simply to prove that the
power over it is real and&amp;nbsp;absolute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there is also a severe difference of perspective. I am
using Hate, and most other emotions, as a tool. My friend is viewing
Hate as an adversary in and of its own right. Maybe it is this
perspective difference that bothers&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t that the viewpoint is alien; it is all too familiar. I held the
same opinion for many years and thought myself a good person. Now that
my stance differs, does this make me a bad&amp;nbsp;person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think where we meet is here. We both desire power over Hate, but view
it as two different heads of the same beast. My friends power comes
through Name Magic and degrading Hate to other, possibly less sever
emotions. This means that Hate isn&amp;#8217;t even itself. It is something else
that isn&amp;#8217;t worrying as much about. My power comes through its&amp;nbsp;manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have always been&amp;nbsp;sneaky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may then wonder why I have told you all of this. Doesn&amp;#8217;t this blow
my sneaky cover? This is because when I decide to Hate you, you will
have forgotten all of this. And after I remind you that you have been
warned you will Hate me all the more. Sneaky,&amp;nbsp;see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can play on a fair and open field, and&amp;nbsp;win!&lt;/p&gt;

have to be smokin&amp;#8217; hot?  It is such a conundrum to see them in their physical
glory while being throughly debunked&amp;nbsp;mentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had written this whole huge post this weekend that was amazing. But
I left it o my main machine at home which has no internet. It is a
little philosophically entrenched, so ya&amp;#8217;ll will have to wait until
tomorrow to not read it. I know I loose peoples attention whenever I go
off the deep end like this. But I think this one is important.
Furthermore I expect most everyone to disagree with me, so if you don&amp;#8217;t
you should really speak up so we each know that we aren&amp;#8217;t the only whack
jobs in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took my car into the shop today to get a tune-up, new back tires, etc.
So I am with only my feets to moves mes around&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I frankly do not know how I got any work done today at all. I listed to
the Penn Jillette radio show the *whole* 9-10 hrs at work today. The
show is now unfortunately off the air but the backlogs of the podcasts
are available&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were times when I wanted to just burst out in explosive, infantile
laughter but had to hold back since my cube-mate work totally not
understand Penn&amp;#8217;s whole day of people calling in and giving their own
obituaries was a work of comedic&amp;nbsp;genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the plus side of this side, I may, *may* get to go to ApocaLARP. I
might even get to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt; with my cousin and his new female&amp;nbsp;attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also if we thought we had it bad in Austin with the Anthonies floating
around everywhere, we were dead wrong. My cousin informs me that my
friend Rachel (with whom I have a near avuncular relationship) has
dragged Andrew 4 into their friend group. At dinner at Anime Expo (which
was this pas weekend) they had Four (4) Andrews in a party of Eleven&amp;nbsp;(11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A melody is like a pretty girl&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Who cares if it&amp;#8217;s the dumbest in the world&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s all about the way that it unfurls&lt;/div&gt;

He
picked it up and rubbed it and out popped a Jewish genie. The genie
said, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll grant you two wishes. Anything you&amp;nbsp;desire.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;The black gentleman thought about this for a while and then said, &amp;#8220;First, I wish to be white. And secondly I wish to be next to some warm, wet pussy.&amp;#8221; So the genie turned him into a tampon.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8212;From the Truly Tasteless Joke Book&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know if any one else has ever noticed this, but I have. In
Austin, walking around campus, I ofen see hot, hawt, or good-looking
guys going with gals that are not quite as attractive (in my skewed&amp;nbsp;book).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, this natural order of things seems to be reversed here in Idaho
Falls. I more often than not have seen the more attractive member of a
couple be the&amp;nbsp;female.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all working up to this couple I saw yesterday which was by far
the most dichotomous I have had the chance to observe along these lines.
The female looked to be healthy and well proportioned. Thin, but not
unnaturally so. Tall-ish and well developed. The male was a 5&amp;#8216;9&amp;#8221; - 5&amp;#8216;10&amp;#8221;
sasquatch who weighed 200-225 lbs. None of this mass appeared to be
mussle. If there is such a thing as a beer belly, he was packing a
kegger. The female was absolutely hanging on her partner like a gibbon
at an Ape&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;abitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If put seperately one would not place these two on the same level, or
even prime material&amp;nbsp;plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Interjection: I am sitting here at Villa Cafe, my home I&amp;#8217;d rather live
in, and there is this strange middle aged couple that keeps staring at
me. I stare back and they turn away&amp;nbsp;momentarily.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, Nightwish is touring&amp;nbsp;again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even better than this they are going to San Antonio in November. I am
going. Furthermore someone is going with me, beacuse going to concerts
alone is lame. Ya&amp;#8217;ll can volunteer now or draw straws as the sacrifice
or whatever. There must be one who will partake with me or be
unwillingly victimized otherwise. If persecution is the only option, I
will of course pay for the ticket. I&amp;#8217;d rather it not come to that&amp;nbsp;though&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been invited to float the Snake River on Tuesday with some
coworkers. I am not sure I am going to go. I think it is up to how I
(read my stomach) feels that day. I haven&amp;#8217;t tried my swimsuit on in
years. Ok a little more than a year but&amp;nbsp;still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am slightly less pregnant today. My doctor took me off of the
probiotic (which didn&amp;#8217;t really work) and has instead put me on an&amp;nbsp;antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thinking I guess is that there was some good bacteria that wasn&amp;#8217;t
populous enough and that is why I was all bloated. However since this
doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to be the case, there may in fact be too much of a bad
bacteria so now we must kill&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets hope this&amp;nbsp;works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If getting here in the middle of the week was bad enough, I am
absolutely dreading this weekend. I don&amp;#8217;t even have anything specific to&amp;nbsp;hate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a car now so I guess I could take off and go somewhere but I am
surrounded by&amp;nbsp;Idaho!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know why this place depresses me so. If anyone actually wants to
live here I say let them&amp;#8230;move them all&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to get out of here at the first opportunity, which means
next weekend I am going to force myself to go to the Grand Tetons and
Yellowstone. It would be a crying shame if I came up here and didn&amp;#8217;t go
to the National&amp;nbsp;Parks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really want to go either. I simply couldn&amp;#8217;t live with myself if
I passed this&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#8217;t that I am lonely. I am horrified by&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way people make their comings and goings is atrocious. I cannot
safely say that I want to kill everyone around me, rather I want them&amp;nbsp;dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I *know* I don&amp;#8217;t get to make this decision; I *know* it would not be
Righteous to have them all destroyed. If I were Lot, Idaho would be
rubble and I&amp;#8217;d never look&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also know I am quite misanthropic today. A true dystopia would be
preferable to this absolute atrocity of a&amp;nbsp;land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDAHO&lt;/span&gt;, I, a Latter Day Saint of sorts, have come to tell you
to get out while you can! Leave Before this place descends into a pit of
its own&amp;nbsp;awfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A pretty girl is like a violent crime&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;What is Helen Keller&amp;#8217;s Favorite color?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Corduroy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, I know Helen Keller&amp;nbsp;jokes&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to write about how awful getting to California was, but that
seemed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAME&lt;/span&gt; so I&amp;nbsp;stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I will tell you all about my movements starting with my New&amp;nbsp;Car!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically it is a 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder (he is our hero) Two
(2) door Convertible. I got it with a mere 70,000 miles. I bought it for
$5,000 which is about $2,500-3,000 under blue book. The main reason it
was such a deal was that the gentleman I purchased it from was moving
back to France in Ten (10)&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a four liter engine with a nice sound system. It can cruise at 80
or 90 mph without batting a metaphorical eye. It can theoretically seat
4 people. Two of them should be small or sort or&amp;nbsp;non-existent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very glad I poured the money I would have spent fixing my old
Mercury Tracer into getting this puppy. Humorously, the insurance on
this $200 cheaper every 6 months than my last car. I think this is
because of the Two (2)&amp;nbsp;airbags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also happy that I kept it within the less than 10 yro&amp;nbsp;margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after driving it all the way out here to Idaho Falls (port to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt;?)
I am still getting used to driving&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Unlike my other cars and some of the other ones I was looking at, you
can feel every bump, curve, and uneven patch in the road. While this is
aMAZing on the one hand, it is very different from the type of vehicle
that barrels over everything in&amp;nbsp;sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) 70 seems dreadfully slow. I daresay it is difficult to drive in
residential&amp;nbsp;areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll suffice it to say that the after the drive out here I know
Nightwish a lot&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough about my&amp;nbsp;car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up pregnant&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an illusion but a good one at&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stomach was distended again to all get&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really hate this bullshit (which on another level I purchased the
first season of&amp;nbsp;yesterday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have called my doctor and talked to a nurse but am awaiting the head
dudes response. The concoction I am currently on clears up to
constipation pretty well. I am still bloated. Quite&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is an interesting thing though. I have been having these problems for
at least two years. However for the first year I didn&amp;#8217;t recognize it as
a problem. This is because I was fat. Thus I thought that I was just
having slightly fatter days. Having lost some weight I am now able to
notice when I bulge out 2-5 times my normal size. Thus by being
healthier I found more&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me wonder what other ailments I have that I am simply to sick
to notice. This is likely true for many&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think cancer is a perfect example of this. Historically, cancer wasn&amp;#8217;t
a primary disease since people did not live long enough. However, as the
life expectancy grew, so did the cancer rate. The analogy is perfect for
my dummy&amp;nbsp;tummy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;But while you&amp;#8217;re here we will have a ton of fun in the sun and I&amp;#8217;ll shun every pun till your done when I&amp;#8217;ll buy a gun at which point you&amp;#8217;d better start to run.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my trip was fantastic, mostly. Basically sans everything that was
travel related and I rocked it. There is so much to tell I will
therefore save some for later. I&amp;#8217;ll start with some observations about&amp;nbsp;Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) I was waiting at a gas station to catch the shuttle bus from Idaho
Falls to Salt Lake City so I could take a plane out of this land. I had
gotten thee about an hour early to be on the safe side (I actually
didn&amp;#8217;t know how long it was going to take to walk there and I was
overcompensating for my small penis). I was sitting on the ground
outside reading &amp;#8220;Pride and Prejudice.&amp;#8221; I was on the side of the building
that was opposite the sun. A couple of 60-something men wearing baseball
caps and suspenders come round the corner a little after half past and
say &amp;#8220;Getting some shade, eh?&amp;#8221; I reply &amp;#8220;Certainly.&amp;#8221; They light up. A
couple minutes later the say, &amp;#8220;Hey young fella, do you have the time?&amp;#8221; I
stand up and tell them the time and they tell me they were just
wondering what time zone they were in. This piqued my curiosity so I
asked them where they were headed and they told me California. Further
inquiry revealed that they were visiting a bother in Montana and were on
their way home to Chico. They told me n amusing story about how just
before they left some of the college students piled Six (6) couches
together in the middle of the street and burned them in celebration at
the end of the school year. This brought back found memories of Isla
Vista. All in all this was the most pleasant conversation with a
stranger I have had here. It just goes to show that the nicest people in
Idaho are actually from&amp;nbsp;California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) More Graffiti Phun: On the road between Idaho Falls and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLC&lt;/span&gt; there is
an entire three story abandoned building that has every square in
covered with graffiti. The subject matter of all of this is simply
homecoming messages to those returning missionaries. For example
&amp;#8220;Welcome Elder So-and-So&amp;#8221; is all over this derelict. Those goddamn
mormon punks&amp;#8230;think they can just go about like they&amp;nbsp;do&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) People here call Idaho Falls &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;. This really confuses me because I
can&amp;#8217;t understand why anyone would ever want a port&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a car! I drove it out&amp;nbsp;here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look at it here: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://scopatz.googlepages.com/home"&gt;http://scopatz.googlepages.com/home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought this totally impractical toy for about $3k under the blue book
price. I am way pleased. It has a couple of odd issues like the gear for
the convertible top is stripped so you have to open it manually, but I
think I can&amp;nbsp;live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I got this baby so cheap was because the owner was moving
back to France in 10&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also my financial aid came through so I will no longer be under the
threat of&amp;nbsp;starvation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that is enough for&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be like Pardot Kynes. Is this such a crime? I am already
focused on high level system studies. Is planetology so far removed?
(Watch me answer my own rhetorical question)&amp;nbsp;No.&lt;/p&gt;

yesterday (more complaining about Idaho up&amp;nbsp;next!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julian Alexander Scopatz, whether you know it or not you are surrounded
by Wild Animals! Your Hebrew name, Ariel, means lion of God (which you
occasionally resemble). As a baby you were known as Taz, for the
Tasmanian Devil. Your first programming language was Python. Your first
Linux distribution was Gentoo, which is a species of penguin. (Shane
stands up and says âI am about to become an Anteater, you know&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCI&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be asking âSo what do all of these beasts ave to do with me?â
Well, for one, you are all ravenous&amp;nbsp;carnivores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question you should be asking rather is âWhat can I learn from my
fast and furry-ous&amp;nbsp;friends?â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Tasmanian Devil you can learn that life is often a frantic and
chaotic experience. You, Jules, can learn to survive only if you are are
able to match the pace of life. Adapt quickly and be off to the next new
and exciting&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Python we are going to go with the Ancient Greek view. In Greece
there were no poisonous or dangerous snakes. These animals were often
kept around the house as loyal pets. They were also rather clean and
thus became associated wit medicine in the ancient world. Therefore,
learn to protect the health and safety of family, friends, and loved&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Gentoo penguin, the lesson is clear. The world is a cold and
uncaring place. Sometimes you can make it through the day only by
submerging yourself totally in its frigid waters and hunting for
sustenance. Other times, there is safety in numbers and you can push
through by relying on the masses. Even the Stranger does not have a
heart of stone and their Kindness is a warm retreat from Icy Arctic
Blasts. Our People, have survived for millennia in Diaspora occasionally
relying on on&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Anteater comes the important lesson that you do not always have
to be exactly like your brothers. Shoot off into the world. Do your own
thing. Grow a 14â long tongue.&amp;nbsp;Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, Ariel, the lion disseminates his message. You are Holy.
Your people are Holy. What makes you, us, we Holy? You chose us! You are
Jewish because you chose to be. Mom being Jewish, the circumcision,
learning Hebrew, All of it. These are no more than rituals to let us
know that you should be Jewish. What makes you Jewish now is that, as a
man, you have cast your lot in with the people of your birth. Your
decision; your choice. This, as you know, is a path that once chosen,
cannot be veered from any more easily than a train being derailed. In
Jewish society you now have the âright to&amp;nbsp;vote.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with these rights come certain obligations, as always. As a lion,
these charges are doubly present. As a man you now take responsibility
to selflessly do what is best for your family. You must be Righteous.
You must be a light unto the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a responsibility to be noble. You have a responsibility to be
benevolent. You have a responsibility to protect those whom you can.
However, don&amp;#8217;t loose yourself in this work. If you are not for yourself,
then who will be for you? And if not now,&amp;nbsp;when?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay, we are all proud of you and we all love you. I love&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YMCA&lt;/span&gt; the other day and while I was leaving this odd fellow
shambled into the locker&amp;nbsp;room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out he is an Artist and his medium is old telephone wire. He
had a slurred speech pattern with many stop gaps in inappropriate
places. He claims to have done an American flag and a baseball cap that
made it into the&amp;nbsp;Smithsonian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there was this older, crazy man talking to me. He told me all about
life and how precious every day was. I am pretty sure he blessed me with
some heathen ritual. I smiled and&amp;nbsp;nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then found out he had brain cancer and had just passed the five year
mark from when it was&amp;nbsp;removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soundly put in my place I reevaluated my stance of this place as Hell;
maybe it is simply a Purgatory where people wait to die? It is still&amp;nbsp;Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also just saw my first two Punks in this place. They were walking out
as I was walking in. The male looked like my former roommate Josh only
taller, stronger, and with an actual Mohawk. The female had bright
orange short hair and was earing some sort of black, badass shirt. She
was wearing an incongruous white skirt and flip-flops&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were the most attractive couple I have seen here. I had to keep
myself from staring as I knew it would be&amp;nbsp;misinterpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the closest I&amp;#8217;ll ever come to a live &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLC&lt;/span&gt; Punk except that is
where I lay my head&amp;nbsp;tonight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of Idaho!&amp;nbsp;Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8220;A mountain is something you don&amp;#8217;t want to Fuck with!&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FZ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.1 miles&amp;#8230;what&amp;nbsp;bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;Q: Why is having a wife and a mistress better than getting a divorceand then remarrying?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;A: Atreides never as satisfying.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hung out with Jake and Josh last night at Josh&amp;#8217;s house. This was after
my crushing defeat at the hands of Google&amp;nbsp;Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked out in Josh&amp;#8217;s father&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMAZING&lt;/span&gt; home gym. We lifted weight ad I
was clearly the weakling. Which makes sense sine I do mostly aerobics
and the others were much taller and/or stronger. I did my personal best
and am paying for it&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake turns out to be an interesting person. He has some very interesting
and hard to deny political ideas. For one thing he is a hardcore
Capitalist to the extent only Kerry Prime can match. Politically he is
otherwise rather liberal/libertarian. He kinda reminds me of Tara in
these&amp;nbsp;respects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also he is buff. I want his body. To be in it&amp;#8230;not to just do floral
arrangements&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using my Mentat training to pump him for information about his
family and therefore his sister,&amp;nbsp;Ariel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariel is six years older than him. He expressed some intriguing ideas
about his&amp;nbsp;relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Because of the age difference, he didn&amp;#8217;t feel like he grew up with
her. Which is odd to me since I feel like I am growing up with Jules and
he is nine years my&amp;nbsp;youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) He claims she can be grating on him since she takes a sort of
&amp;#8220;better-than-you&amp;#8221; mentality, with him at the very&amp;nbsp;least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) Because of 2 he claims tat they don&amp;#8217;t hang out much and aren&amp;#8217;t that&amp;nbsp;friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly they don&amp;#8217;t have a perfect relationship (but who&amp;nbsp;does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Status: I have copy of &amp;#8220;Dune&amp;#8221; waiting to give to Ariel, on the condition
she passes it off to someone else after she is done, should I ever run
into her&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the interesting&amp;nbsp;stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Jake and I are new friends with this new information, it might
uncomfortable to make a pass at Ariel, especially through him. Which was
the Prime Projection before yesterday. Now, it would be even&amp;nbsp;stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is really intriguing is that in some sense, I want to hand off
this book and let her make the decision. This is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOTALLY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Weak!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think I have ever made a solid, boldfaced advancement in my
life. At least not to anyone who I thought was a serious possibility. I
always try to find all relevant facts and then manipulate others into
making the&amp;nbsp;call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even more odd about this situation is that even my minor pursuit
could jeopardize seriously the limited friend group I have in&amp;nbsp;Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some sense this makes me want to do it even more. Or be even more
bold. Just to see how people react. I would do this thing to add to my
knowledge&amp;nbsp;base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#8217;t it wonderful how selfish I&amp;nbsp;am?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would happen if I asked Jake to give Ariel the book? Her phone
number? &amp;#8216;Found&amp;#8217; her at her&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t settled on a strategy yet. I have decided to wait until after
the Bar Mitzvah to make my&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone I am related to has been touched by Loki. We all pull
this shit. Some of do it for the good of humanity while others just for
themselves. I used to be the former, but I am moving slowly toward the&amp;nbsp;latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apologize is this post was a little too Whiny. Was&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Q: Why was the God-Emperor of Dune complacent with the plot to kill him by throwing him off of a bridge?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;l&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Big n l Leathers&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Other &amp;#8216;L&amp;#8217; is right there! How did they miss&amp;nbsp;it?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news I lost a bet yesterday and had to pay up today. Here was
the deal. Josh, my coworker, has this insane sense of distance. He
claimed it was ten miles to the mall from where I live. It is less than
four. He also claimed that it was 15 miles from his parents house to&amp;nbsp;mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called him&amp;nbsp;out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said it was 5 or maybe six-ish at the most. This was at lunch
yesterday so we bet on lunch today. Loser buys sort of thing. He said
that anything above 6 was&amp;nbsp;his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consulting Google maps gave this heart crushing&amp;nbsp;answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distance: 6.1&amp;nbsp;miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the old as-the-bird-flies defense, and then the &amp;#8220;this is not the
most direct route&amp;#8221;. He wasn&amp;#8217;t taking&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So even though I was actually right and he was 2.5x off, I ended up
loosing and buying lunch today. Fine whatever. But then he goes and buys
one of the most expensive things on the menu and orders a couple drinks.
He really wasn&amp;#8217;t a graceful&amp;nbsp;winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I am a bit peeved. But I had the moral victory and I
will get back at him somehow&amp;#8230;.I can&amp;#8217;t be too mad because he let me
borrow his bike&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Stolen from some&amp;nbsp;website&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;if they had enough ink,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;they could draw a k5 on her chest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;What is difference between a Cell Phone and a Tampon?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Cell Phones only go into assholes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last Two (2) days walking, wandering, reading aimlessly
in a mall. Odd considering I freak out whenever I go into an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEB&lt;/span&gt; or an&amp;nbsp;Albertsons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I consider this all part of my Mentat training. I am gathering data points. I am desperately trying to understand this place. People I meet
in any sort of professional of formal environment (eg work or when I am purchasing something like a meal or other commodity) are always
wholesome, genuine and kind. The random person on the street, the Stranger, is a
complete&amp;nbsp;asshole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is easily imagined. The Stranger needs some examples. First,
many times since I have been here and twice today, folk have shouted,
screamed, yelped as they pass me by in their cars. I am always on foot on a
bicycle. Their purpose is clearly to scare me. Occasionally they just&amp;nbsp;honk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, some asshole in a 200X convertible Ford Mustang actually had a
megaphone mounted in the car. In between the unintelligible yips and
yelps they were essentially just spitting into the&amp;nbsp;receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clearly combines whatever idiotic tendencies this person had with
a certain amount of Promethean inspirations. Unlike the famous titan,
they were using their powers for evil and self&amp;nbsp;amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when I have passed pedestrians on a bike I have gotten more
than one slur and expletive to watch out even when I am nowhere near
hitting them. For some reason they think it in my best interest to do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time at the mall has helped me put all of this into some perspective.
The pattern has started to&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People here are fundamentally afraid of the Other, the Outsider. They
are scared of different ways of doing things. The Other has to prove
their own humanity before being&amp;nbsp;accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore the society is stale. There is vary little here that is
not an extension of some national or international corporation. Almost
everything is homogenized. Those things that aren&amp;#8217;t tend to be old and decrepit.
The failing and nearly vacated small downtown is a perfect instance of&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everything that is seen is repeated. The endless repetitions of
the tones of what is accepted has taken a huge toll on the communal&amp;nbsp;psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people here are so xenophobic that I am not sure they really know
what America means. To them it is simply a word. I don&amp;#8217;t think they have
an idea of what Democracy is. At the same time they assimilate what other
parts of the country they can, but only through their corporate colored
glasses.  Almost everyone here speaks with an accent that is half central
valley Californian and half midwest. Somewhere on the travel across the
country in their covered wagons, they grew weary, settled down and declared this
place god&amp;#8217;s country. They gave&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, the locals are waterfat and they do not even know it. It
is disgusting. I have never felt so removed from nature as I do here.
They claim this a high desert and constantly bicker about water rights
between town and country, county to county. However they use such a
precious resource with such impunity. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVERY&lt;/span&gt; lawn is watered. All parks are
green. Many trees are planted. Specifically the non-native disiduous
ones that suck up vast&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#8217;t believe me about waterfattness, they treat all resources
the same. Idaho was the only state whose governor did not attend the
Western State&amp;#8217;s Governors Association meeting last week. This was a
significant meeting since it had to deal with a unilateral way for all
states in the region to combat climate change and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. Idaho claimed there were more important things to worry&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas should really invade and show these people how to run a state.
California could, but I think they are too busy with other things right
now. All of the surrounding states are too small on their own. Texas though I
think could be convinced to take over Idaho for strategic resource
reasons. Texas afterwards would be unwavering in their control over the occupied
peoples. California would surely mess this part up. Texans I feel would
be more of the mind &amp;#8220;Well, you *had* your sovereignty, but You messed it all
up so now its gone. Oh Well. Here is how we do things Now.&amp;#8221; Idaho needs
some tough&amp;nbsp;love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idaho also needs some diversity if they are ever to recover from this
stagnetion and fear of the Stranger. They are too homogeneous to truly
be accepting of those not like&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously, the state has its fringe populous. These people have
given me accounts of growing up here that fit largely into the
formulation above. Some of them have moved away, but through various economic pressures
have had to move&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This land is a den of inequity. They have sold the soul of the Commoner
for a Starbucks and Peir&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Mullets, Bullets, Dope is what I&amp;#8217;m yearning for.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Southern Hospitality goes out the door.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Get in my Camereo put the pedal to the floor,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&amp;#8216;Cause in My Land we still rob liquor stores.&lt;/div&gt;

the last post as the third hit! Crazy,&amp;nbsp;huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately this will probably go away since I locked this post today.
I had originally intended it to be âfriends only readableâ since there
was some possibly sensitive material in there. I realized I hadn&amp;#8217;t after
I had left the&amp;nbsp;library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;#8217;s post was not all inclusive as I wanted to keep it to one
topic. I think this town is so suppressed that some very odd things
happen here. It is a matter of observing them as odd. While strolling
down various byways on the way to/from a bookstore, Two (2) things&amp;nbsp;happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) A repeat of the âCheese graterâ incident. Two youths were riding down
the sidewalk towards me. Female on point and male behind. As the 16 yro
boy passed me on my right, he said, with great clarity of purpose in a
voice only the three of us were sure to&amp;nbsp;hear,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;â&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOOOOOOOOONADS&lt;/span&gt;â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only there had been a leather couch or chair or even an ottoman
around, I would be rolling on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) A man (if you can call such a degraded beast that) rode past me from
behind. He was dressed as a hot dog and was riding a Vespa. To top it
off he had a sign on is back that I could clearly read as he rode off
into the sunset that simply said â&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOG&lt;/span&gt;â. You know, just in&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Bookstore I picked up âChapterhouse: Duneâ, which is the last &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FH&lt;/span&gt;
Dune book I have to read (I missed it before somehow). It turns out that
I must be somewhat Atredies. My prediction a couple of posts ago about
the Israeli&amp;#8217;s secretly being Bene Gesserit is completely true. Just by
another&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that throughout all of the crap that happens in the Dune
universe that Jews have survived and have formed a secret society that
they even the Bene Gesserit are not allowed to speak&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is more future Jews have their own Other Memories, have mastered
pain, can have sex with Honored Matres and not become slaves (the only
others in the Dune universe that can do this are Kwisatz Haderachs in
waiting can do), and they have their own separate breeding program. Of
course many of them are also Mentats and Suk doctors. Moreover, from
what I know right now, they can do all of this without&amp;nbsp;Melange!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being a Jew! Even in a fake&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I am currently contemplating: Ariel, Ana wrote emailed me this
week (twice), and Miss âGreen Sweatshirtâ Allison from Wheatsville just
called me and told me she has started reading the book I lent her and
that she is no longer working at&amp;nbsp;Wheatsville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday the pieces will fit&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;How many Bene Gesserit does it take to screw in a light bulb?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;One to screw it in and 400,000,000 to have bred the right bulb to be able to screw into many sockets at once. What&amp;#8217;s more it is screwed in a generation early!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Caveat: Thomas Edison was Greek and Fought in the Trojan war.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;I must drink beer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Beer is the mind-killer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Beer is the little buzz that brings total hardcore crunkness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I will face this beer.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I will permit it to pass into me and through me.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And when it has gone I will turn the barstool to see the rest of the bar.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;When the beer is gone there will be none left.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Only one Bourbon and one Scotch.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you couldn&amp;#8217;t tell I went drinking last&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is surprising because I was not planning on having a drop at all in
this hell-hole of a&amp;nbsp;state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sort of dragged out to this comedy club thing last night. I wasn&amp;#8217;t
planning on going at all; instead I was going to organize part of my
home file system. As I was doing this though I came across an old text
document that contained part of an old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt; conversation that Sean and I
had. It was like he reached cross the years and put me in my place. I
laughed so hard I was on the floor. I went to the comedy&amp;nbsp;club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy Jake, who Josh works with and I could easily call friend, was
not yet at the venue and was press-ganged into picking me up. This meant
I wasn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He picked me up at the Mormon Temple, wind blowing through my hair and
telephone receiver. However, there was a girl in the passenger seat.
Odd, Josh hadn&amp;#8217;t mentioned anyone else and by Jake&amp;#8217;s own account from
the day before he was&amp;nbsp;single.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was introduced as Ariel, Jake&amp;#8217;s sister. So I had heard of her, I
just wasn&amp;#8217;t aware of her presence in Idaho. Jake had mentioned she used
to live in the City. Other than&amp;nbsp;that&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made it over to the club, where precisely Two (2) events of note
occurred. The rest was a typical, well-played social encounter. You can
fill in the&amp;nbsp;gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) My eyes turned green. Real Green. The kind of color they only change
to on special occasions. Most of the time when I see a fine girl my eyes
turn blue out of defeat. Green. This is something&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) After they comedy was over they brought out a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ&lt;/span&gt; and laid some phat
beats. The group of like 9 of us went to the floor for various time
periods. The odd thing was that this big in all dimensions man
thuggishly tapped me on the shoulder after the music had stopped and the
floor was&amp;nbsp;clearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;âWe&amp;#8217;re leaving.â I said.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;âI&amp;#8217;m not a bouncer dude&amp;#8230;â he responded and I looked at him blankly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;â&amp;#8230; That girl over there wants to talk to you dude.â&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;âWhat the fuck are you talking about man. Go away.â I left.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girl was surrounded by a veritable posse of others. I am glad that
even in my much inebriated state that I could smell the stink on this.&amp;nbsp;Strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night was not without mistakes. Early yesterday I had planned to
tell all new people, when they asked me what I do, that I am a writer.
If they probed deeper I would be forced to tell them I am merely an&amp;nbsp;academic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I totally forgot to do this with Ariel, but I was with her brother and
another coworker so it probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t have worked. But if it had it
would hve been beautiful since she has a degree in&amp;nbsp;English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of unanswered question on how to proceed from here. My
intentions are not pure and that is the way I like&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if everything from here on out goes awful, at the very least this
is a good case&amp;nbsp;study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night was amazing. I really enjoyed myself. I guess some fun
quantum tunneled into&amp;nbsp;Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My son found a nice little vixian&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;He tells me she&amp;#8217;s a wealthy Ixian.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;But for my Jewish boy&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Never a Goy.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And besides she is such a shiksian.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There I said&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s look at the facts. This recent Palestinian civil war is an amazing
feat of strategy in terms of the Sisterhood&amp;#8217;s ghols. Think about it. The
Israeli goal is, more or less, to survive as a state. Unfortunately,
they are a country surrounded by countries that either don&amp;#8217;t want them
in the region (Iraq, Iran, Yemen, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UAE&lt;/span&gt;, etc.), countries they have
conquered and forced peace out of (Lebanon and Egypt), or Jordan who
doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be in the cross fire. Furthermore, internationally
Israel has gotten a lot of flack for some of its practices in varied
fields. yet they are still tolerated&amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing they aren&amp;#8217;t doing is a forced breeding&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is optional. This Fatwa-Hamas conflict has the Bene Gesserit
signature all over it. Israel is in ultimate control of the situation
here. They could move in at any moment and declare martial law and stop
the fighting, but that would be considered rude. It is possible that
everything in the past, their whole degradation of their own reputation
would just be to prove that they are fundamental more organized than
their opponents. They have the Other Memories. If they didn&amp;#8217;t plan this
then they are certainly taking amazing advantage of the&amp;nbsp;situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another note, I am pretty sure Isaac Asimov founded&amp;nbsp;Ix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I once followed the Golden Path&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To escape the Tyrant&amp;#8217;s Wrath.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Then I gave it up later&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;To become a Guild Navigator&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And now all I do is Math!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Mechanic: What seems to be the trouble?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Me: I think I got some sand in there. Can ya clean it out?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Mechanic: Well, let&amp;#8217;s take a look under the Shai&amp;#8217;hulud.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;To the ancient Greek writer, Herodotus,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Said a pretty young thing, &amp;#8220;My how hard it is!&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;I will hurt you, my dear?&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;And she said, &amp;#8220;Are you crazy? Thank God it is!&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Isaac&amp;nbsp;Asimov&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asimov would clearly trump both Lupin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;III&lt;/span&gt; and Duncan&amp;nbsp;Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library here is an interesting place. The only graffiti I have
noticed here is on the inner wall of the male down stairs bathroom stall
and it reads simply:&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOOK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they are still learning. Other choice bits I have read across town
include &amp;#8220;I believe in faeries&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Anarchy is&amp;nbsp;Cool.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit. I have been listening to Nightwish on my Zune at work. It
makes me feel cool. I can&amp;#8217;t explain it. I shouldn&amp;#8217;t even try to. For
some reason, in these moments all thoughts and feelings of camp in the
work are expunged and I fall into the simple joy of rockin&amp;#8217; out to the
best power cords in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNIVERSE&lt;/span&gt;. See how Idaho brings out the best in&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My cousin Aaron wrote the Wired Article about the last interview with
Mr. Wizard (which h actually&amp;nbsp;conducted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;Also&amp;nbsp;Asimov&lt;/p&gt;

I *hate*&amp;nbsp;Duncans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHY&lt;/span&gt; do I *Love* Duncan&amp;nbsp;Idaho?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be transparent but I have also joined the Dune bandwagon. My
stop is coming up soon though. I am rereading the fifth book. The more I
think about it they, just get better as the series goes on. Miles Teg is
a complete&amp;nbsp;bad-ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And speaking of bad-asses, I saw my first Lupin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;III&lt;/span&gt;. Specifically, The
Castle of Cagliostro. It was beautiful the older Animation way that I
love so much. But, back to the point, no character n that whole movie
was not incredibly&amp;nbsp;cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, naturally, brings me to my point. People are drawn to
representations of humans who that they can&amp;#8217;t relate to. The familiar
argument that humanity connects with its art through personal
substitution just does not always&amp;nbsp;hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now ok, that may be obvious that it isn&amp;#8217;t strictly true because very
little is strictly&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that there is so little that unites me to most of these
characters, likable or not from the, it is strange that I am drawn to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be some fundamental human truth this figures typically face
great adversity and hold up with astonishing resolve and wit. Now, all
must face adversity and fear and danger. The characters&amp;#8217; cleverness is
certainly&amp;nbsp;admirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, from a moral perspective, almost none of these characters win
because they are on the side of&amp;nbsp;Righteousnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok so now we can say that someone is bad-ass and deserving of praise if
they are good under pressure if not good&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not eclipse non-bad-asses from being&amp;nbsp;compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in answer to the original question I think that Lupin would be able
to beat Duncan Idaho in hand to hand combat &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUT&lt;/span&gt; only if Duncan Idaho did
*not* have his mentat abilities and was not in a Tleilaxu enhanced&amp;nbsp;ghola.&lt;/p&gt;

blitz style of reading through comics, manga, webcommics,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I originally said that I thought it was kinda a one horse town.
Well, I retract that after the Faye-comes-out-about-her-past strip. It
is now at least a three horse&amp;nbsp;town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I have&amp;nbsp;noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) While I was slowly, due to lack of effort, putting this together I
came to the realization that the indie scene is the modern day analogue
to the Mods. Now &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QC&lt;/span&gt; wasn&amp;#8217;t the only data point in this fit, but I think
it certainly brought the error down a lot. This is almost disconcerting.
Not that I didn&amp;#8217;t like the Mods; quite the opposite is true. What is
strange is that they are back, and so&amp;nbsp;subtly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) The author is obviously some sort of post-post-modern nerd humor
titan. A single Dune reference would have solidified this placement. The
âMom Jabbarâ pun however has only ever been matched by Hiro Protagonist
himself. (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt; Robin if you have finished Snow Crash we need to have a
talk ^_^ It has been at least 4 years since I have had a good talk
about that&amp;nbsp;book)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) All of the female characters have short hair (as well as all of the
male&amp;nbsp;characters).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of hair, I think I finally understand one aspect of my mother
that had previously mystified me. My mom tends to dye her hair
outrageous colors. She does this mostly for fun but it also as a device
to figure out who the people that are worth knowing and putting the
ignorant in her&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I think I experienced one of my first compulsions post-middle
school. I feel like I should shave my beard, cut, spike, and dye my hair
electric blue, wear embossed black leather cowboy boots, a leather
trench coat, sunglasses, carry around a gunsword, and paint my right
pinky fingernail red and walk around Idaho Falls just to see who would
talk to me. Because you know those people have got to be at least a
little forward thinking. Screw everyone else. Considering I live across
the street from a Mormon temple and walk&amp;nbsp;everywhere&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;They probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t take kindly to me yelling that they are a
heretical cult to a sect of my religion that accidentally believes that
Jesus was the Messiah and then mated with and slaughtered a bunch of
pagans. See how Idaho brings out the best in&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am justified, and I will tell you why. Right here. In the park
across the street from the Temple of the North Star or Neon Genesis
Evangelical or whatnot, there is a statue of the Ten&amp;nbsp;Commandments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am livid at this&amp;nbsp;statue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw it and just stood their screaming what the fuck at it for a while
until I was starting to get a couple of&amp;nbsp;looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more severe consequences aside from the fact that the
commandments are in English (which is most certainly not Ha-Shem&amp;#8217;s
language) and that they are so poorly translated that no wonder people
are ignorant (the imperative not to murder is given as âthou shall not
killâ, and the covet ones are all messed up). The two single most
assaulting things about this statue&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) At the top of each of the two tablets is a little monogram of the two
tablets. Ok cool whatever..self referential Mitzvoht. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOWEVER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WRITING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THESE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MINI&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TABLES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUNIC&lt;/span&gt;. That is right, there are Celtic
runes on the tablets. Now keep in mind that this appears in two places
on this statue, so the designer clearly knew what they were&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Underneath and in between these two monstrosities of cultural
con-fusion was an Ariel, a lion if god. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUT&lt;/span&gt; he was standing and
partially wrapped in a United States Flag! If this wasn&amp;#8217;t my brother&amp;#8217;s
Hebrew name I am not sure how personally insulted I would be, but I am
sure I would be hurt by it&amp;#8230;if not physically&amp;nbsp;ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topper of it all was a disclaimer plaque next to the thing that
claimed they weren&amp;#8217;t espousing any particular religious view but merely
trying to represent and pay homage to âmankind&amp;#8217;s first attempt to codify
lawsâ or some&amp;nbsp;such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOOOOOOOOOOOO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That isn&amp;#8217;t even trying. Any high schooler can tell you that the first
written law record that is presently referred to as such is Hammurabi&amp;#8217;s
Code. However anyone with half a brain could figure out that Ur or the
Egyptians must have had laws before the Israelites or the&amp;nbsp;Babylonians!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuck! Moses received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFTER&lt;/span&gt; leaving
Egypt&amp;#8230;you know the place with the oppressive leaders and slavery and

movies included. I hadn&amp;#8217;t seen it since I was 14 or so. For those of you who
haven&amp;#8217;t seen it, there are really three main age categories of the&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;1) 14 yro&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;2) 30-ish yro&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;3) Those older than 30-ish&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have changed much since I last saw it and have learned a lot about
animation and film and psychology since. I found myself stuggling with
it much more now than I had before. Early on I saw it mostly as an
interesting story about people who are generally rather whiny and not
really sure of themselves. I didn&amp;#8217;t personally identify with any of the
characters. In fact, I still don&amp;#8217;t. However my opinions about them have
changed. Or rather, the fact that they are inept and complain a lot
doesn&amp;#8217;t bother me so much&amp;nbsp;anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I lied, their is one character I identify with and that is Ikari
Yui, the wife of Gendo and mother to Shinji. It is eventually revealed
that her whole role (which may seem minor, but is the driving force for
all events prior to the first episode) is simply so that she can create
a symbol or record of humanities existence that will outstrip the even
the life of the sun. This is the ultimate dream of science combined with
the baseness of being human. To create something that will outlast all
else that we know proves our power, our intellect. As a scientist I can
respect Yui for both her work and giving into this desire and admitting
it openly. And after all, you&amp;#8217;re a scientist for god&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;sake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a story it had a moral and a point, like most stories. Furthermore
that point was something that I have thought about occasionally within
the years intervening my viewing and frequently within the past year.
Though the telling is convoluted, Rei eventually reveals the ultimate
decision that is placed in Shinji&amp;#8217;s hands and also the choice he has
made. My way of putting this decision is as&amp;nbsp;follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;If one had the capacity to instantly and permanently (no chance of
recovery) and without suffering erase all life, would&amp;nbsp;you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the way that people answer that question tells a lot about
themselves. It is an uncomfortable question for most people and the only
two people I have formally posed it two tried to shift the terms around
and declare that it was irrelevant. Eva is interesting in that they
actually ask this question but do it in such a roundabout way that
people don&amp;#8217;t know that they are asking it until it is too late (end of
last movie). What is even more interesting is that the character that is
given that ability comes (or was predisposed) to the same answer that I
have. This answer is that maybe such a state of affairs isn&amp;#8217;t entirely a
bad&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here the moral goes a little soft and for some reason the
characters life force is still around and is given a chance to reinstate
life should he choose to do so, and of course he does&amp;#8230;noting of course
that everyone he killed has to resurrect themselves. This is rather lame
but the point was made, they just cover it up so people don&amp;#8217;t leave on
such a&amp;nbsp;downer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that irked me this time that didn&amp;#8217;t before was that the
animation was so close to being just balls to the wall weird and out
there and convoluted in terms of the story telling. What bothers me in
all of that is of course that it *wasn&amp;#8217;t* as strange as the makers
clearly had the capacity to do. It felt like they were restraining
themselves. It was almost like they needed it to be approachable to the
masses rather than strange and invigorating. This consistently annoyed
me. Whenever they went into some psychedelic state there was always a
voice over walking the viewer through. I am smart enough to infer what
is going on; let me,&amp;nbsp;please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the pleasure I got out of this watching was from the neat things
I would notice that the animators did that are subtle but poetic. My
friend Justin noted when we were kids that there is a rather hilarious
moment when the creators are trying to be funny in the first episode
when the car is blown over by an N2 bomb explosion. He noted that this
is the one and only point where the animator specifically added in
things like that. However, there are in fact many more, right up to the
end, they are simply less blatant. They relive the tension of the show
with out the viewer even realizing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the real strokes of beauty however comes at the very beginning of
the second movie. Misato has hacked into some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NERV&lt;/span&gt; mainframe and is
trying to discover its ultimate purpose, why she is doing the things she
is doing. The document is flashed on the screen quickly before something
else deletes it. I however, thinking I could divine some juicy fan
trivia, went back and paused at the moment the document flashed on
screen. The document happened to be in English. The document is actually
a story that talks all about the creators of the anime and how they
thought of this in college and then eventually got signed to big
corporations etc. If it is not immediately apparent, I will explain how
awesome and hilarious and cool this is. Here is a character who is
trying to find the truth and reveal the truth. What is revealed to her
is the full, unadulterated truth. To her point of view it might be
considered a meta-truth. In explains, to us at least, in detail the
whole reason why she exists as an animation in the real world. But it
also explain it to her, which in some sense is forbidden knowledge in
any &amp;#8220;serious&amp;#8221; story. Furthermore since the document is in English and
flashed on the screen quickly, most of the original viewers would have
not understood and simply believed that the character had found some
truth within the story that she was proported to find and not the
absolute truth that is&amp;nbsp;given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I liked it this time much more than before. Most of the
characters are whiny bitches, but hey most of the characters are&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really should stop watching media. My feelings afterwards are always
mixed. Do I really enjoy consuming it or am I hunting the&amp;nbsp;past?&lt;/p&gt;

disseminate this&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright. On the drive out to Idaho, about 50 miles north of Las Cruces,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NM&lt;/span&gt; my car lost all of its coolant. I was driving along and within one
minute I got a check coolant light and then all of the water was
evaporating out f the top of my hood and I lost all power (while going&amp;nbsp;uphill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfazed I got out and plugged the fuel injector wire back in (3 out of
four had popped out) and poured all of my emergency drinking water that
I carried in my &amp;#8220;everything&amp;#8221; box into the radiator. This was a
calculated risk as I had great cell reception and figured if I could get
the car moving I would be able to make it to the next town and buy more&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was stranded in the desert in some beautiful country. I would have
taken a hike while the car cooled down but I needed to watch the
vehicle. Instead I read some of my book and watched some AMVs on my
zune. Unfortunately the car was deader than a doornail and I got a tow
after about an hour and a half back to Las Cruces. There I had the
garage do an $85&amp;nbsp;inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that in no known order the coolant pump and the head gasket
died. There may have been damage to the actual head which would have
cost me more. The known price to fix would have been almost $800. Keep
in mind I have about $300 to my name at this point and I had just taken
the car in two weeks prior to get it inspected to make sure it was
journey worthy, at least to Idaho. I dropped about $1000 in it this
semester that I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I needed to get to Idaho by monday to go to training which only
happens once every&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the car rental places in Las Cruces were closed by noon or 2 on
Saturday and didn&amp;#8217;t reopen until monday and I was sitting at the garage
at&amp;nbsp;four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is what I did! It turns out there is a shuttle to the El Paso
Airport that runs 12 times a day and I took the second to last one.
There I rented a car that I could only afford with my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAA&lt;/span&gt; discount.
Also, I asked on the phone when I was reserving it if I could pay with
cash even thought I could give them a credit card. They said yes.
However, I get there and apparently you need the amount of the rental
available on your card when you do this. I barely had enough to buy gas
all the way there. So I called up my credit card and begged them to
raise my credit limit. Jason at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAA&lt;/span&gt; Credit phone service is my
hero. I love his soft collected voice as I struggled with the inaneness
that is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AVIS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got back on the road, 100 miles behind, 11 hours after I left
that morning. I V-lined for Albuquerque. There I stayed at a Howard
Jonson express. Sunday Morning I went to the closest Trader Joe&amp;#8217;s to
Austin and it was divine. I have never been happier to be in
Albuquerque. I then finished the remaining 14 hours of my trip and
arrived in Idaho Falls at about 11:30 Sunday night. I unpacked and went
to bed for my five hours of sleep and woke up went to my training.&amp;nbsp;Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until this point I was calm and happy. Patience and some forethought
allowed me to effectively see through this challenge. Besides, I got to
spend some extra time in New Mexico, how could one even think of being&amp;nbsp;mad?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idaho Falls however is a crying shame. You&amp;#8217;d think there would be some
mountains here, but there aren&amp;#8217;t really. They are small and in the
distance. You&amp;#8217;d also think that there would be some waterfalls. There
are but they are artificially created by a hydroelectric dam and only
drop like 6 feet. This town is the definition of&amp;nbsp;Lame!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also all the cool stuff in Idaho is far away and needs a car to get to,
but since I left mine in Las Cruces&amp;#8230;.. Also most of the worthwhile
stuff in the city is out of walking range. I am lucky enough to live
within a mile and a half of work. Also my place doesn&amp;#8217;t have internet so
I have to sit in the library with my laptop. Also the library won&amp;#8217;t give
me a card since I am not a permanent&amp;nbsp;resident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so out of here in six weeks. I don&amp;#8217;t know how I&amp;#8217;ll leave since I
only have $200 mostly to eat with for the rest of the month. But I will
find a&amp;nbsp;way&amp;#8230;..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say that I have now achieved one of my life-long goals of
staying in Howard Johnson&amp;#8217;s. This is an obscure hotel chain that is
briefly mentioned in an even more obscure Zappa song. Furthermore the
song is *not* on 200 Motels, which is the album where you&amp;#8217;d figure a
chain such as this would&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;

Awesome as always.
Their Synth player rocks hardcore as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection of women there would have delighted a Turk. There was a
woman there who had a face quite similar to Jessie&amp;#8217;s. Even weirder was
that she wore her hair in a style that Jessie also had. I guess it goes
with the&amp;nbsp;face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was short girl who was cute in that
average-but-short-so-still-cute-and-probably-hates-being-short-because-of-it-kinda
way. There also was a girl there who kinda looked like Maria Thayer from
Stangers with&amp;nbsp;Candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lest you think I was think I was *only* noticing women, there was
a guy who looked a lot like Jon. Also the bartender sort of looked like
Andrew 2. The cut of his jib was very prohibition era and consequently
he could call the woman with Jessie&amp;#8217;s face &amp;#8220;sweetheart&amp;#8221; and other such
affectionate and distancing addresses. I approved as I typically&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;

haven&amp;#8217;t really gotten up the&amp;nbsp;nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today that was shattered. I saw both Shrek 3 and Stranger&amp;#8217;s with Candy.
As you may have guessed, Shrek 3 was good and had some shots that were
straight out of Buster Keaton (Steamboat Bill Jr. if I am not&amp;nbsp;mistaken).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranger&amp;#8217;s with Candy is a must see. Much of this film, apart from being
downright hilarious, had an amazing attention to detail and subtlety.
Stephen Colbert plays a near psychotic in-the-closet gay science teacher
part of the joke being that his out self is a born again Christian. The
periodic table shaped like a cross on the back wall is spectacular and I
covet it. Amy Sedaris had a wonderful role as a quirky and insane woman
in her 50s who returns to high school. While it is an All Star cast in
every sense of the word. Many of the important role are filled by people
who are excellent actors with at least regards to what roles they are
playing. Maria Thayer plays an uncomfortable foil to Amy Sedaris&amp;#8217;
big-house lesbian domineering. Carlos Alban plays an awesome geeky
Indonesian student whose accomplishments go largely unrecognized even by
his&amp;nbsp;peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all the movie had a sound moral which was delivered in a humorous
but unpleasant fashion. For a film that relies mostly on words to convey
its message, this one is certainly high up there on my&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am furthermore pleased that, like riding a bicycle or throwing a
Frisbee, watching a film, truly watching a film hasn&amp;#8217;t quite left me yet
and it is not a wholly uncomfortable experience and I still find it
pleasant. This pleases me.&amp;nbsp;Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that is super disgusting it is a distended belly.
Having lived with this for the past three years, I know what it is like.
The method my doctor prescribed works. In the process I tried a bunch of
different eating habits and have run across one I like. I am going to
need to become more active. In truth I let this slide as I had no energy
and was bunglingly fat even though very little of it was truly blubber
but rather prior meals. I know this is all terribly interesting but I
think it marks an important point. I still don&amp;#8217;t feel perfect about the
way I look but I do feel a lot&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have to love you for who you are, but part of who you are is what
you look like. Not wanting to be who I was, I think this is a positive&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beard/chin dilemma remains. For those of you who don&amp;#8217;t know, I don&amp;#8217;t
have a chin. One has started to slightly appear having lost some weight.
However I do have a beard, with which I cover it up and fake a chin like&amp;nbsp;nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for those of you who do not know, I think beards are the social and
biological equivalent of boobs. Allow me to explain. Men, naturally, do
not get to choose how much facial hair they grow, like breast size for
women. Furthermore, certain sizes and shapes are more socially
acceptable than others (or desired). Because of this a lot of money,
effort, and time is spent augment ones natural appearance, beyond what
is needed. The difference in maintenance here is that women have a large
one time cost for permanent augmentation where men have a a contiguous
upkeep cost. Women, if you don&amp;#8217;t believe me, then fine, but this
actually happens; men get discriminated against based solely on the
quality and style of their facial hair. Beards, like boobs, when longer,
bigger, more natural, and uncovered ones tend to appear on hippies and
bikers. I happened to be born with a large bushy, Muir-like, Rebbe-esque
beard which is socially&amp;nbsp;undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about keeping it shaved again, just as a social test,
again. I don&amp;#8217;t recognize myself without it. Though I can&amp;#8217;t stand to
watch the show, the best comparison I have to how I keep it now and what
I would go to is Rikker from Star Trek:&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? I know some of you haven&amp;#8217;t seen me in a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;

my favorite programming language. Initially I was appalled, frightened.
They are doing a couple of things that are scary but take a lot of
courage. First, they are breaking backwards compatibility. Furthermore,
knowing how I code, nothing I have written so far is inane enough to
make it past this barrier. This partially because they are making print
into a function rather than a syntactical element like for, if, etc.
This really annoyed me until (who wants to type parentheses anyways?)
they pointed out that as a function it could be overwritten in your
module! How fun would that be to have a version of print that highlights
every letter &amp;#8216;e&amp;#8217; in red when it prints. Furthermore, I think this helps
with some of the otherwise weird issues in running external programs
inside of python with respect to printing&amp;nbsp;stout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of the main philosophies about Python is that everything
(that can be) is a list. This makes refereeing to elements inside of
otherwise bulky structures ease, and iterating over them simple
(imported files for example are lists of lines read from that file, or
can be). This adherence is going away and being replaced for some
structures (like dictionarys) with iterators. The dict.keys() object
won&amp;#8217;t be a list&amp;#8230;which is odd, but instead will be an iterator over the
list of the dictionary&amp;#8217;s keys. Similarly, range() will be an iterator
that is know known as xrange(). Iterators tend to be more effiecent than
lists, especially for large lists. This is good as it will force me, and
others, to write better code. I like the idea of going to iterators
where you can. I hope they make this a full Philisophical change though,
rather than simple a couple, often used special&amp;nbsp;cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is amazing because of its solidness of philosophy and adherence
not &amp;#8220;natural coding&amp;#8221;. The obvious fear is that if the excitement to come
up with something better they may make the product more unusable.
All-in-all I am still excited to see how it all works. It should be fun
to dick around with at the least. It just seems that all of my favorite
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; projects out there are changing or dying. First my window manager has
ended support and the project is dead. Python is changing. Gentoo had
some internal shake up earlier this year. If all I have to look forward
to is Ubuntu on a Dell, then I will be one Peeved Panda&amp;nbsp;v16.&lt;/p&gt;

juice selection and I choose apple. They brought it to me in a can which
I stared at for a while before before drinking. After consuming it and
setting it down I said something like, &amp;#8220;Why did I get apple juice, I
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HATE&lt;/span&gt; apple&amp;nbsp;juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;I told the nurse all about how I wanted to be a computational&amp;nbsp;physicist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;When Anthony first walked in he asked me how I was. I said, &amp;#8220;Oh man I
am so relaxed. I feel like I could go into my parents basement and smoke
weed and listen to Pink&amp;nbsp;Floyd.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I find out about any others I&amp;#8217;ll let you know but I think that was
all of the good ones. All in all, yesterday was by far the most pleasant
day I have had since coming to&amp;nbsp;Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is much better than I remember it being when I took my class
with it. Mostly because it was supplemental and not helpful to the
mathematics being taught in the class I was&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However this book and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu/research/rddeegan/cornstarch.avi"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; movie have convinced me to go back into
physics &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASAP&lt;/span&gt;. But don&amp;#8217;t tell anyone. I still need to make it out of
Nuclear Engineering with a degree. I think the only way to sever ties
happily is to convince them that it is best for me to leave. I kinda
don&amp;#8217;t know how I am going to do this nor exactly how I can guarantee my
getting in here at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UT&lt;/span&gt; Physics dept. I have certainly learned a lot
in my year off. Most importantly I have learned that I accomplish much
more when I am not in a relationship or near family or any of my
traditional distractions. I think that is why I do very well whenever I
jump from place to place. Is settling down an&amp;nbsp;option?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Sean and Nick are both living in Santa Cruz and I am very envious.
It looks like Shane and Andrew will both be in Irvine and I am seriously
jealous. I have always relied on Andrew to provide the friend group
where I wasn&amp;#8217;t a dominant personality (read Extrovert). Now that he is
forming his own, second friendships (and integrating them with his
current and past as he always does) I would like to be there for it.
Furthermore, How tight would it be to go to college with my brother
albeit Grad and Undergrad&amp;#8230;That would be more fun than a keg of drunk&amp;nbsp;monkeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I am moving to&amp;nbsp;Idaho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin will be hard to leave and I don&amp;#8217;t think my time is up here yet. I
don&amp;#8217;t foresee myself dating anyone while I am here, which may be
compelling enough a reason to leave. If I can find no suitable method of
occasionally satisfying my carnal desires, then I&amp;#8217;ll be pretty sick of
this place after about three years I think. Also it might be culture
shock moving back to a place not Texas. I have carved out a home here
and I am loathe to&amp;nbsp;leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this because of Chaos. I am working diligently and strongly for
my professors. They give me unreasonable demands that I was once able to
fulfill, but now that I am having all these weird stomach aches and
vegan-ish, I am having trouble accomplishing with, if you pardon the
pun, any regularity. I feel if I am going to work my tuchas off and not
really make a livable wage, then I should at least be doing something I
love. Something I can get excited about. Something I can jump up on a
table and shout about how cool it is. It is weird, but I finally found
something that is intuitive and challenging and fun to me; and yet I am
not doing it. Step by Step, I will get there. My five year plan has
changed every year for the past three or four years. Sometimes it has
vacillated more than once a solar&amp;nbsp;cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so easy to pretend I was lactose intolerant and use that as an
excuse. But I am not and can now eat all that stuff should I choose&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so sick of changing diets all the time it is almost worth it to
stay where I am. Also being vegan was much easier than I anticipated. I
still have some of the problems that plague people who live with these
restrictions in that it is hard to go shopping for food and furthermore
I find it expensive. I am not sure one&amp;#8217;s dietary habits should be based
purely on what is economical&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I do not have all the hangups about animal cruelty that most vegans
do. I already am essentially vegetarian. Furthermore if I was to stay
vegan for purity of body reasons, this doesn&amp;#8217;t quite hold. While
Veganness certainly holds to the Jewish ideals in this matter, Kashrut
is not nearly as restrictive as all that even in its strictest sense. If
I was&amp;nbsp;Hindu&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t been having the cheese or meat cravings that I was having
initially&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the problem rests that I have no compelling reason to stay vegan but
no real reason to give it up&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you&amp;nbsp;think?&lt;/p&gt;

certainly has a talent for dealing with computers and other algorithmic

at modularizing information and processing it quickly. Hopefully at his

I didn&amp;#8217;t go outside at all. Instead I have
dedicated this day to hedonism and science. I finished writing up a lab
report that took me two weeks to write. I learned a lot of Mathematica
in this and probably increased my skill level from passing fair or
moderate to expert or veteran. I am still not a Mathematica super-gawd
or developer or wolfram&amp;nbsp;clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly than all of that I finally sat down and learned TeX,or
LaTeX rather. Now that I know it, it is the most indispensable piece of
software ever written. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GCC&lt;/span&gt; and Emerge don&amp;#8217;t touch this baby. It is
absolutely clear why everyone uses it. My one complaint is that trying
to get figures to do what you want them to is a bit like teaching an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADD&lt;/span&gt;
child whom is also suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder. They
really want the blocks arranged in a certain position and even when you
can convince them that they look better in a different arrangement, they
still move them back to where they originally put them. But literally
everything else about writing a paper is made easier. It looks totally
professional and I can write it in nano&amp;nbsp;*&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GASP&lt;/span&gt;*!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More importantly than all of that, my family just left town after coming
for Pesach. It was wonderful to have them here and now I am a bit lonely
again. Unfortunately, while my brother did make it into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt; for dance he
did not make their academic requirements. Also despite is amazing
audition for Juliard, they also declined his application. This means he
is not going to New York, yet. He did, however, make it into both the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCLA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCI&lt;/span&gt; dance schools. Many congratulations on those fronts are in&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lactose free diet is going well, even though I have gone to Amy&amp;#8217;s
twice this past week. I am simply relegated to eating nothing but dark
chocolate for desert&amp;#8230;Oh Darn! Other than that it has mostly been
vegetables and eggs since I can&amp;#8217;t really have any bread either. Carrots
are about the sexiest food in the world. Move over Cucumber. Carrots
have that nice other-worldly orange coloration and are conical. You can
bisect them with a plane (knife) and learn some math at the same time.
This all reminds me what I came on here originally to say. Doesn&amp;#8217;t it
suck when you can&amp;#8217;t even remember your wet dreams? If you are going to
go through the pain of having become that frustrated without release,
you might as well enjoy&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

Even if you don&amp;#8217;t like
Punk read on; you&amp;#8217;ll come to see that I define it very generally and
reach some interesting&amp;nbsp;conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punk is like Rice. Rice is one of those canonical foods that goes well
in any culture across a huge variety of foods and tastes. Indian,
Mexican, Chinese, Greek, You-Name-It! Rice can be bland or&amp;nbsp;spicy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punk is the same way. Just as that rice is consumed, but rarely a food
unto itself, punk is listened to in a similar manner. It is chameleon
like in its genre. You can add Punk to nigh any style of music and
barring one actually getting a better product, you at least get a more
poignant&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify Punk here extends far beyond what is known as Punk Rock. Punk
is that quality of anti-establishmentallity that forces one to take a
more extreme and critical stance on the state of affairs. This Punk
attitude manifests in music as a declaration of free speech and
nay-saying of the standard bearers of the formulaic industry. My claim
is that this happens across musical genre lines, just as rice transcends
the taste boundaries of culture and&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, Punk Rock certainly exists (Punk being an operator
acting on the variable Rock). Punk Rock, like the Ramones, actually
suffers from the fact that Rock is so out there and self-critical and
campy and fully admits all of these things that there is less room for
Punk Rock to comment on Rock that Rock does not already comment on. Rock
already hates itself; Punk is needed. That being said, the Ramones and
other Punk Rock bands make neither great Punk nor great Rock, or are at
least limited to good Rock sans the social&amp;nbsp;comentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not far from the Rock Regime, but with significantly less self policing
is the field of Surf Rock (Surf Guitar). A perfect example of Punk Surf
Rock are the Dead Milkmen. Their songs are structurally Surf Guitar
songs and they would be well suited if they could play their instruments
to a Surf Guitar&amp;nbsp;standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting variety I have found is certainly the Punk Folk or
Punk Country. This is most fully (and possibly only) engendered by Mojo
Nixon and Jello Biafra on their album &amp;#8220;Prairie Home Invasion&amp;#8221;. In some
sense this is merely updated Folk music. Traditionally Folk is all about
the laments of the people in the time that they lived. These songs,
transfered, lost their connotations but retained their charm.
Reappropriating their charms to the modern day we get the same sort of
music commenting on the laments of our time. While I don&amp;#8217;t claim that
traditional folk music (in this country at least) is or was Punk, I do
say that the pathos of folk is that of&amp;nbsp;punk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as he might hate me to say it, Frank Zappa and the Mothers wer
very punk in some of the work, especially in their earlier stuff. but
retaining this later on as well. The vocal songs on Freak Out may be
seen as a sort of Punk Doo Wop while other songs of his may be
considered Punk Jazz or dare-I-say Punk&amp;nbsp;Classical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I would also classify bands like Green Day as Punk
Grunge and Bad Religion might be more of a Punk version of Metalica
which would make them Punk Metal rather than simply being&amp;nbsp;rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The punk message is strong and&amp;nbsp;tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

for a walk. I walked down the Shoal Creek trail and down to Town Lake
and then back up though the city proper. Shoal creek is actually quite
nice and very close. I am quite pleased and surprised that I had never
been there before. The connecting trail from Shoal Creek to Town Lake is
terrible though and I do not recommend it to anyone for any reason other
than that I am pretty sure there are some bats living under a couple of
the bridges. All in all my mood was very much in swing on this trip. I
felt very good about Austin in parts and then disgusted by the
metropolis in others. I would be so much happier on a ranch in West
Texas. I don&amp;#8217;t know. Maybe I am one of those few people who doesn&amp;#8217;t need
others. That can&amp;#8217;t be entirely true however, as when I am in the city I
am very reliant on other people, especially socially. I could be happy
alone on the border between the wild and civilization. Or with others. I
am fine with loved ones living with me there. Nothin&amp;#8217; too complicated
though. I swear, Austin has been the move that has given me the least
access to nature. Nothing of substance is over the back fence, like all
other places I have been, or the really cool places didn&amp;#8217;t have a back
fence. Maybe I should find a job in&amp;nbsp;Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

I
managed to visit three of our glorious National Parks in this time,
including one that is among my favorites. Mostly we did hikes that
Garrick would have hated but Kerry would have loved. I had a total blast
and I am now depressed to be back home. For all of its charms, Austin is
still a city and unlike Santa Barbara there is no way to pretend it is
not. You can&amp;#8217;t even see the stars at night. Here is how the trip went&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday: I woke up at 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; and was on the road by seven with Michael and
Patrick. We reached the Chisos Basin Campground of Big Bend with enough
light to set up camp. We spoke with Bob, the campground host, about
acquiring a site the next day. We made arangements with a funny man for
a site for the next&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday: Michael and Patrick and I went on a couple of day hikes. We
first walked the paths around the campground. We then went down to the
Rio Grande Village area of the park and hiked the short but effectual
Boquillas Canyon trail where we walked around the banks on the river. We
saw at least four border patrol guards on this trail. Two of them were
mounted. We then traveled down a rough and tumble, unpaved road to make
the hike up the Gateway trail. The rest of our party, Tony and Sierra
and Ana showed up at about Ten O&amp;#8217;Clock that&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday: Michael and Patrick and Ana and I went on the Window trail out
of the campground at Chisos Basin. This lead us down the only outlet for
water in the Chisos Basin. It was very pretty and the end lead us out to
a precipice that was at the bottom of a water carved canyon whose walls
were maybe 20&amp;#8217;. The overlook out onto the desert was certainly one of
the best on the trip and definitely the best view per mile needed to
attain. We then went to the Panther Gap visitor center to procure a
backpacking permit which had its own intricacies which I will explain
later. We then traveled to the Rio Grande visitor center, ostensibly to
see a ranger talk about the Agave family. However! I totally misread the
location and the talk was actually at Panther Gap. Since we were in Rio
Grande though, we just decided to walk part of the Hot Springs trail
until sunset. It was very&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday: Backpacking! So we decided to do the Blue Creek trail and got to
know it quite well. However, all of the primitive sites were taken by
the time we arranged for a permit. But never fear, they gave us
something else which turned out to be actually much cooler. They allowed
us to do a thing called zone camping. This basically meant that we were
given a whole area of the park (along the Blue Creek trail) in which we
could camp anywhere as long as our site couldn&amp;#8217;t be seen from the trail.
This meant that Patrick and I got to run a scouting mission for the rest
of the party to find a suitable campsite. We hiked as far in as we could
and remain in the&amp;nbsp;zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday: The negative part of the zone permit was that we had to eat all
of our food each day since there was no bear box, but you know you live
and you buy a bear barrel. This meant that on Tuesday Patrick and Ana
and I did a speed run back to the cars. Ana needed to go to the store so
we took her. We got back to base camp the same time that Michael and
Tony and Sierra were packing out. After Patrick and Ana and I broke for
lunch we continued on our day hike. Our goal was the highest point in
the park, Emory Peak at an elevation of 7825 feet. for starters we set
out to finish the climb up the Blue Creek trail which became
significantly steeper nigh immediately after our camp. The end of the
blue creek trail meets up with the last mile of the Laguna Meadow trail
and ran us right into the middle of the Chisos forest after climbing out
of the remnants of a fire from fifteen years prior. Finishing off the
Laguna Meadow trail wee took the Colima trail to cut off the rim trails
and go straight to the end of the Pinnacles trail. About a mile down the
Pinnacles trail we met up with the Emory Peak trail and hike to the top
in a last grueling leg of the journey. We reached the peak at about 5:45
pm or about five hours we left base camp. Believe it or not coming down
off the mountain was more difficult than the ascent. Patrick hadn&amp;#8217;t
brought enough food so was nearly feinting and after the sun set was
having trouble retaining his body heat. He wore an emergency blanket for
most of the way down. Ana had forgotten to pack a coat so I let her
borrow mine. Luckily everyone remembered their flashlights. The going
was slow, however, and we didn&amp;#8217;t return to base camp until 10 O&amp;#8217;Clock.
All in all, this day had a grueling 18.6 miles covered with a total
elevation change of 3700 feet over 14 hours of&amp;nbsp;hiking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday: Ana and Patrick and I packed out and drove to Carlsbad, New
Mexico! We rented a room at a Motel 6. I recalled a very tasty Italian
place from my prior trip and we did find it. However the establishment
was for sale! I nearly cried. The restaurant, Pasta Cafe, was closed due
to bankruptcy. Word on the street was that the owner was a cocaine
addict. This night, drinking&amp;nbsp;ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday: First we went to Guadalupe Mountains National Park and were
lucky enough to find a campsite in the Pine Springs campground, which is
the only one in the park. We then went to Carlsbad Caverns National Park
for a change of pace. This visit was particularly neat. Since the bats
were not around at this time of year, the visitors were allowed to hike
down into cave through its mouth rather than being forced to take the
elevator. A group of cave swallows greeted our descent. Returning for
the evening to Guadalupe, Patrick and Ana and I saw went to a ranger
talk about the Butterflies and Moths of the park. The ranger, Anne
Marie, had taken some of the most beautiful pictures of wildlife I have
ever seen. She was a very skilled photographer. Patrick and her had a
pleasant talk afterwards where they compared cameras and&amp;nbsp;methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday: This ushered in the last major hike of the trip. Though we got a
late start due to some possible car trouble, we did fully accomplish the
Guadalupe peak trail. This trail hikes you up 3000 feet to an elevation
of 8749 feet in 4.2 miles to the top of Guadalupe Peak, which is the
highest point in Texas. We were leisurely and tired about our way and
the trip took something less than seven hours. Much of the time spent at
the peak was doodling in the log book. One former hill-topper had
written about how he and his party were feeling Mexico and escaped the
Zapatistas and were staying there for the moment before hopefully
completing their delivery (vital to the revolution of course) to Santa
Fe. Patrick responded by writing an entry that describe how his party
had hunted down the rebels using a tip off from the Zapatistatas. I
wrote down the definition for the Mandelbrot set. Ana wrote &amp;#8220;I feel
free&amp;#8221;. The peak itself had some amazing views. One could see out over
all of Texas it seemed and really understand how it had all been under
water. Luckily we made it back for anger Dave&amp;#8217;s talk entitled &amp;#8220;Island in
the Desert&amp;#8221; which was all about the three areas of the park. These areas
are namely the desert and the forest and the strange region in&amp;nbsp;between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday: We packed up and drove home. The trip is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am back in Austin I feel oddly depressed. The city is not for
me. I can&amp;#8217;t see the stars at all. I can&amp;#8217;t really go hiking. For all of
its charms in the human world, Austin is distinctly lacking in those
charms of nature. Not that it isn&amp;#8217;t beautiful in its own right. I do not
feel safe here; I do not feel at home. I do not feel that I could
disappear. The City has gone on without me. Society continued and left
me behind. The Street didn&amp;#8217;t care. The Frost Bank didn&amp;#8217;t care. I was
here and then I was gone. Upon my return, nothing noticed. I am not
needed here.&amp;nbsp;School.&lt;/p&gt;

To be
more illuminating I proctored this exam today for a graduate class I
have not yet taken. I was ostensibly doing research during this time,
but more on that later. I was also signed into my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt; client and I was
talking to Meenon. At one point she said something that made me actually
laugh out loud. Of course all of the studious students vigorously
working take a short reprieve to stare at me. It was most&amp;nbsp;humorous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get some actual work done, however. I had been having trouble
fitting this data I have to any sort of reasonable function with
anything resembling accuracy. The key however was to take the natural
log of the data. The plot of this oddly enough looked like a log plot
which then became a line. This, of course, let me know that there was
both an x dependence and a Exp[x] dependence. This gave me a general fit
which looked like a*x*Exp[-b*x], which worked like a dream. It was
cool because this is not one of those functions that people have a lot
of familiarity with and no one looks at its plot and says &amp;#8220;Blamb! I know
what that is!&amp;#8221; I knew something was weird about it this weekend because
it is a monotonically increasing function whose second derivative is
zero in two places over our domain. That is to say that when I plotted
the line of best fit, the data crossed this line twice while keeping its
positive slope, it is just that the slope changed. Of course that was
just the dependence of the data on one variable. The other variable was
not nearly as difficult. Right now I am busy recalculating the data
adding in a third independent variable. This will likely take&amp;nbsp;overnight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that was certainly aimed at the not-quite-modern cross section
literature.&amp;nbsp; There are many and varied other categories of books, to my
mind that would be much better suited especially if you are going to
muck up such a collection of incoherent works as this.&amp;nbsp; I am personally
involved in reading the works of John Muir and have found them to be
much more satisfying than all save three of the ones that I had read.
Furthermore they didn&amp;#8217;t include any of the books out there that I had
read and ultimately loathed that were not written by Dickens.&amp;nbsp; They
listed all of the Harry Potter books individually and all of the Lord of
the Rings books.&amp;nbsp; Substance!&amp;nbsp; For&amp;nbsp;Me!&lt;/p&gt;

on this Technology&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I have been into listening to a variety of extremely simple and
cheesy dance songs by the Europop group E-Rotic. Most of their music is
delightfully hedonistic to listen to. They have their style and they
totally run with it, no holes barred. Most of which consist of the
standard techno elements but with slightly less repetition. They sing
almost exclusively about sex with heavy overtones of the female
vocalist&amp;#8217;s moans. I don&amp;#8217;t think, and so I have read, that they are
native English speakers. Most of their lines are quite short and contain
a lot of rhyme and syllable matching. For example: &amp;#8220;Max don&amp;#8217;t have sex
with your ex, it will make your life complex.&amp;#8221; Somehow this endears them
to me all the&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I have also mentioned before newfound appreciation for Blondie.
Normally repeating one&amp;#8217;s self is a sign to stop&amp;#8230;but not&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have started eating bulk trail mix that I mix myself from the store.
Sometimes I worry about myself. Often. Now I know I am repeating&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, not much is really going on as I spent nearly the entire
weekend at home doing work. I am looking forward to the White Ghost
Shivers 1920&amp;#8217;s concert on Friday. It should be fun. I hope I can
convince someone to come with me. I hate going to that stuff by myself.
Also, I have all this 20&amp;#8217;s aesthetic that is trying to desperately to
get out and I have been neglecting it. The Alamo Drafthouse was showing
Battleship Potempkin last Saturday and I failed to leave because I was
writing a&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In not totally unrelated news, I have resigned (happily!) to not having
much &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; time in the near future in order to do this project that I
am on right and do it&amp;nbsp;quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worry that I am no longer sending out the right pheromones. Charles
Mingus was a&amp;nbsp;motherfucker.&lt;/p&gt;

I saw Obama speak today at his one and
only Texas stop on the campaign trail. The man had a lot of &amp;#8220;kunos&amp;#8221;,
which is an ancient Greek word for cunning that is a common epithet for
Odysseus. It has somewhat negative connotations which is exactly how I
am using it. Obama spoke in a way that way not verbose, and used as few
of what Patrick called moderate sized words, and when he did they were
ones that every bumpkin in their bumplands would know. Not such a
terrible thing and will certainly earn you appeal to the pleabs.
However, is mannerisms alluded to a personality type that almost implies
he certainly know the words he is not saying and that his act is just
that. Even so his speech was certainly well spoken and well worded and
crafty. Ideologically I agree with him on all his main points and it
does take strength to say such things. In my heart of hearts I was
hoping for another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JFK&lt;/span&gt;. This man is not&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about the rally was not the weather. It was like 70F and
raining. Still, there was a lot of eye-candy and I did my best to avoid
staring, but I forgive myself as I had just finished a blitz portion of
my project and have let myself out of my cave. As a subset of the ocular
treats, a disturbing number of them were Duncan look-a-likes.
Fortunately, many of them were clearly lesbians, but that is something
that is never all that clear, now is it? It is almost a reason to become
politically active.&amp;nbsp;Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined the Sierra club. I am not sure if I had mentioned that but I
have. I went to a little meet and greet tonight and it was fun.
Definitely an older crowd, but hey, that is life. I believe I am one of
few people my age who know about it and only because my parents raised
me well and I pay attention. Or at least I used&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met a girl from Hillel this week who is from San Diego by way of
Berkley. I could have guessed that she was from San Diego; she exuded
it. Just something I thought was interesting.&amp;nbsp;Quaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel I am months away from any sort of satisfying relationship, if not
years. The way my adviser talks, I will be working like mad for the next
ten months, which is fine since I get a lot done. The prize at the end
is a three semester masters. It will be a challenge, but such a task is
always something I am up for. In any event, I am quite busy.
Furthermore, I don&amp;#8217;t yet know the type of person here I would be
interested in. What is worse, I am tackling the problem as an engineer
would. Well, that is a lie, I am looking at it as a system&amp;#8217;s study and
seeing society as a fractal (which I swear to you it is!), and trying to
(time-permitting) guide my life along a trajectory I desire it to go on
rather than letting life run its course. Basically all this amounts to
is me being able to make more informed&amp;nbsp;decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is tough to cram a whole week&amp;#8217;s worth of mumbo-jumbo into a&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got a haircut! People tell me it looks good, but they might be lying.
Erich just said, &amp;#8220;You got a haircut.&amp;#8221; which was an awkward interaction
(my adviser, you&amp;nbsp;see).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I am more social than I like to admit. Maybe I am not a happy
person by myself. Maybe I went with shitty friends for so long that I
forgot what it was like to be around people you truly loved and cared
for&amp;#8230;and then have no time for. Real life probably lies somewhere in
between high school and college. So much of what I do is fighting a&amp;nbsp;memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Fez can set me reeling. And not even a real fez, just a picture of&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is escapism. Arbeit Macht&amp;nbsp;Frei.&lt;/p&gt;

I have recently started listening to some of Neil Young&amp;#8217;s non-radio
tracks and he is spectacular. Albeit in a different direction, his music
is every bit as impossible to wrap your mind around as Zappa&amp;#8217;s from a
musicality standpoint. When he is making social commentary (which is
often enough), it is typically about a more common human experience or
is much more direct social justice message than Zappa&amp;#8217;s immersion into a
decadent society that lies and cheats and manipulates the masses.
Interestingly enough, their methodology of taking a well-recognized form
of music and running with those themes off the deep-end and adding in a
little moral whether you are aware of it or not, is strikingly similar
and is not something most musicians do, or artist for that matter.
Listening to the works of their pathos is a far cry from the indulgence
in camp of Susan Sontag&amp;#8217;s world. Mrs. Sontag is of course correct that I
fundamentally enjoy the experience, so I allow myself to continue
listening. I guess what I am trying to say here is that Neil young is
really good, and not just because he is really&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worthy of note, also, I went to a Gay hour at a cafe, because one of my
friends didn&amp;#8217;t want to go alone. The funny thing is that I think I liked
the place a bit more than he did. Interestingly enough, I would say that
an unhealthy proportion of the people in there were extroverts:&amp;nbsp;90+%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valentines day was. I hardly noticed but I did get some free flowers
today from someone who was getting rid of them&amp;nbsp;post-festivities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been getting excited about a possible Big Bend trip. I really
want to go. It has been too long. Oh &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OH&lt;/span&gt;! I am now officially a member of
the Sierra Club. They are sending me a free backpack. It should be
pretty sweet I&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to a really interesting seminar today about Ancient Greece, its
relevance now, and Western Civilization. The speaker was amazingly
perceptive. I would have had his babies. He basically made the argument
that &amp;#8220;western&amp;#8221; was geographically independent and has been for 2,500
years as it originally applied only to those on the western Aegean. It
also goes the other way, and claims that countries such as Japan and
South Korea are western in every sense of the way he means it. To
illustrate the list of interesting points he made would take longer than
his lecture, but suffice it to say that he expressed very well a lot of
things about society I had noticed since my Myers-Briggs awakening,
which basically amounts to my awareness about systems of&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have now rambled on long enough such that no one will have made it all
the way here. If you have though you can leave a little comment saying
&amp;#8220;Screw You Scopatz!&amp;#64;! I should kill you where you stand for saying&amp;nbsp;Guad-a-Loop!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

such a manner that the information control could be contained. Maybe I
am not feeling creative enough&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew leaps and bounds this week in my study of Chaos. I have never
ever felt so at home thinking about something that people might label
difficult. I see fractals fucking everywhere. I always have, but now I
think about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore I found out that the Second Law of Thermodynamics, you know
the one that states mathematically how the universe is tending toward
states of greater Entropy, is false. I want to recreate the experiment
myself to see. I have always struggled with this one. On some level,
Existence doesn&amp;#8217;t make that much sense with this little guy floating
around. Humanity is certainly an orderly force in a spiritual sense if
not a physical&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick and I argued last night on the benefit of gasified coal plants
but not necessarily on the sides you might think. I, as a nuclear
engineer, was for them. This is because my Prof has taught me the
importance of economics. Therefore I feel that any step in the right
direction and you can&amp;#8217;t expect people to have an overnight transition.
Patrick didn&amp;#8217;t disagree; he just thinks an instant transition would be
best; I don&amp;#8217;t disagree with that. Not much of an&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to Karaoke last night. That was a lot of fun. Not as much fun as&amp;nbsp;sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about Jessie lately. If anyone knows where she is
please let me know. I have been thinking about going to Burning Man just
to look for her and run into her and then pretend that I hadn&amp;#8217;t planned
it out. She would know I had. Mr. Rodgers taught me it is fun to&amp;nbsp;pretend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met a girl the past couple of days who looked like Kerry Prime, but
with the right hair color, and who had the fashion sense of Meenon. It
was a pretty spectacular phenomenon. I wonder would Ryan appreciate
that? I could ask him but Mr. Rodgers taught me that it is fun to&amp;nbsp;wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have made a little box in my closet. It is equivalent to a shoe box. I

This will be a slice of life post rather than
one with a meaning directed at individuals who know who they are or
something more&amp;nbsp;philosophical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday I woke up rather late and then got a phone call from Tara. She
sounds a little on edge with life in San Diego. She is holding down like
three jobs. It sounds pretty hectic. I am sure she will make it through&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the first part of my day cleaning my room and it now looks quite
nice. In all of this I got my website back up. I have decided it needs a
complete&amp;nbsp;overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then did some watercolors which I am quite proud of, but have yet to
put on my little board. One of them, while not being necessarily
artistic, satisfies all other conditions that I have for&amp;nbsp;Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then went over to Anthony&amp;#8217;s and Robin&amp;#8217;s place and had to beg to slice
carrots. Our nominal purpose was to cook soup and watch &amp;#8220;My Neighbor
Totoro.&amp;#8221; We did and both soup and film were of tasty and supper-b
quality. The movie was pleasant, but certainly not my favorite Miyazaki
film. The company also consisted of Anna, Ashley (who looks very nice
with her short hair now), Patrick and much later Alex. We had a
conversation about women and the draft (if it is to be re-instituted).
The female members (sans Robin, who wasn&amp;#8217;t in the room) of our troupe
were very much against a co-ed draft &amp;#8220;on biological ground&amp;#8221;. Not many
equalists in the group. Somehow this lead to me making a comment about
boning grapes, which cleared the room of all&amp;nbsp;women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I went to &amp;#8220;Pan&amp;#8217;s Labyrinth&amp;#8221; with Robin and Anthony and
Robin&amp;#8217;s Madre y Hermano. It was quite good, if somewhat unsatisfying. I
love the Alamo&amp;nbsp;Drafthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went to the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REI&lt;/span&gt; on 6th and Lamar to check it out. I wanted to
look at boats, but was&amp;nbsp;disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I went to BookPeople, which is right next door, ostensibly to look
at the hot girls that work at large independent book stores and find a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLBT&lt;/span&gt;/Women/Men Studies book to read. I was tricked though. I ended up
spending a lot of time flipping through their books in the World
Religions, Philosophy, and Science &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Mathematics sections before I made
it to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLBT&lt;/span&gt; section. When I got there I found only two books about
Bisexuals, the stuff on men largely didn&amp;#8217;t resonate today, and the most
interesting stuff were the books on Techno-Feminism. I then realized
that the questions I wanted answered would addressed in books in the
Sociology and Personality Types section. I was too lazy, however, to go
find this section and pick out a suitable purchase. I ended up buying a
book about&amp;nbsp;Chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, the hot girl that I remember working at BookPeople when
I went there in the holiday season was working today. She was a bag
checker for both times. In December she wore a canary yellow skirt but
today she was wearing jeans. Apparently, she is going to be going on a
first date with someone she has corresponded with online. It is a
roller-date. That is, they are going to be going rollerskating.
Creative. So I now know that she is kinda single. This one is out of my
league, but not by much. More incentive to continue my exercise regime,
which I am of course doing totally for my own&amp;nbsp;health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of this story is that it pays to listen in on other peoples&amp;nbsp;conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then came home, and watched South Park and made myself&amp;nbsp;dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

We played Diablo
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; and there was much&amp;nbsp;rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also watched this movie tonight called &amp;#8220;But I&amp;#8217;m a Cheerleader.&amp;#8221; I
highly recommend it. It plays off of many homosexual stereotypes for its
humor, but also has some genuinely witty and ironic moments.
Interestingly enough, of the main-ish characters, all of the female
characters were white and Christian or defects of that faith. On the
other hand, most of the male characters were not one or both of those.
All in all it was a very cute, feel good movie, as most movies about
repressed minorities that I have seen tend to be. They make their point,
which is typically very powerful, but somehow need to justify this by
placing the movie in a happier perspective somehow by the end. Almost
every Israeli film I have seen has had a similar format. &amp;#8220;Water&amp;#8221; by
Deepa Metha didn&amp;#8217;t do this, but then she wasn&amp;#8217;t a member of the class
who she sought her movie to educate about. This is likely healthy. The
slice-of-life phenomenon or the movies about normal meaningless living
of normal meaningless people are ridiculous. At least at the end of
these minority flicks there is a message of hope. Furthermore conflict
is the life-blood of every story. Does this make conflict good? Well,
maybe. But it certainly makes it&amp;nbsp;human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some sense the movie was a coming of age film, which really interests
me all the more. Coming of age films are always about conflict, usually
between self-desire and how that fails to mesh with society. In some
sense, this movie was more refreshing in that it was a coming-of-age
film about an group of people whom were atypically old. I personally
feel that I am constantly learning and changing and the idea that you
have one defining adolescence is kind of a hack job. Maybe this is true
for some people. Most films featuring similar problems with an older
crowd (say a married couple who wants to get a divorce in the 1940s but
it is taboo) tend to be much agnstier than their childhood counterparts.
Do adults truly loose this malleability of form or are they just&amp;nbsp;pretending?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender&amp;nbsp;Exists!&lt;/p&gt;

feel somewhat alienated from random contact with strangers because I am
constantly trying to determine their temperament without faithful Keirsy
in my hands. People can tell&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wrote some stuff and then deleted it, because I didn&amp;#8217;t like it.
$5 to the first person who correctly guesses and posts what it&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh also I have found a new roommate and she is working out much better
than the last all of them ever. This is good for it means I may have a
life.&amp;nbsp;Huzzah.&lt;/p&gt;

best of me this evening. Some of you may have been guessing this
already, but here&amp;nbsp;goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have decided to drop the label of nerd. There exist a field of
definitions with a myriad of flowers growing in it for what this word
means and its origins [1]. It is further distinguished from the words
&amp;#8216;geek&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;dork&amp;#8217;, both titles I have never nor intend to hold. None of
these things are for me&amp;nbsp;anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict as our generation meta-morphs into adulthood, and more
importantly the prior generation (the X-ers), the ideal of Nerd will
become mainstream and more accepted in &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; society. This is in
large part due to the word &amp;#8216;nerd&amp;#8217; becoming synonymous with &amp;#8216;technocrat&amp;#8217;,
and technology has always been cool. The the more we grow up, the more
relaxed about what our generations free-time acceptable activities will&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, nerd is no longer for me. I made this decision a while
ago, but thought it might be a transient response to a former life. I
have waited and thought and decided that it is not as transient as some
have&amp;nbsp;hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A specter from one of these past lives once mocked me by saying that my
belief in change was ill-founded as I had failed to produce a lasting
change in myself. The funny thing is that many psychologists agree with
this [2]. People in the Humanities and Social Sciences tend to believe
that, placing mood and other incidental factors aside, one&amp;#8217;s personality
is set from a very early age with possible changes in adolescence. This
scientist screams out that they are simply making the problem of
understanding the the incomprehensible easier by removing any and all
time-dependent effect. This is fine well and good for a base case, but
dismissing the problem doesn&amp;#8217;t mean the concern is&amp;nbsp;illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in change, and believing allows the foresight to harness it. I
also believe in revenge, which is certainly what triggered a lot of
this. In short, however, my methods have improved many-fold since I last
undertook a major personal&amp;nbsp;restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have learned that is pertinent, is that change is more
fundamental the longer it takes. Epiphany is needed, yes, but forcing
one&amp;#8217;s will onto one&amp;#8217;s environment is a seed that requires the proper
care for wholesome&amp;nbsp;growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be naysayers who say I cannot do it, that I have already
failed. The will &amp;#8220;But you just bout the Diablo box set and the World of
Warcraft Expansion, how does that make you less&amp;nbsp;nerdy?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To them I say that I have, made many friends with and I am related to
people in the gaming industry and culture. For me, this things are
simply a social activity which I will be weening myself and others off.
Furthermore, as some of you have pointed out, it is how our generation
(as I pointed out earlier) communicates. I do *not* intend on loosing
any friends in this as most of the people I know who style themselves
nerds are genuinely good&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it is and has been a purely social phenomenon of late. My heart
just isn&amp;#8217;t in it&amp;nbsp;anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, what my heart truly longs for is being interrupted,
distracted by the presence of the word &amp;#8216;nerd&amp;#8217; in my title. My wanderlust
must take me to my more pure and reasoned&amp;nbsp;pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my choice; I only ask for your acceptance. I do not judge you
for your choices. Understand that we are all truly individuals and
alone. Please do not attempt to comprehend me through any vector; no
good can come of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you couldn&amp;#8217;t figure it out, n =&amp;nbsp;0.[3]&lt;/p&gt;

personally no experiance with any more than 1 other at a&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, simply stated, is &amp;#8220;Assuming that one&amp;#8217;s brain can only
comprehend up to 7 different signals at a time, what is the optimum
number of partners in the&amp;nbsp;bedroom?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say you had a 5-on-1 senario with five partners primarily
focused on one other partner. Let us limit every partner partner to
having 6 body parts with which they can contact meaninfully the one
partner: their loins, two hands, two legs/feet, and their mouth. While
where on the One they touch may matter for pleasure&amp;#8217;s sake and for
geometry (not two body parts may touch the same part of the subject [an
exclusion principle]), the subject may only recive a maximum of seven
signals so clerarly one partner is not enough but two is too many. The
5-on-1 is a complete waste, mathematiclly (psycologically it is likely a
home&amp;nbsp;run!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To return to the original problem, let us now try to satisfy or at least
excite everyone. This is an 0-on-x senario where x is an element of the
natural numbers. Everyone has 6 signals to give and seven with which to
recieve. For normal 0-on-2 sex (where there are 2 people who both want
to be fully satisfied), both parnters are unsatisfied, by one signal for
a total of two unfufilled signals. If you add one to x, then you also
add another 6 signals and 7 slots. Therefore the total number of
unfufilled signas is increased by one. By Induction, 0-on-x sex is
always unsatisfying. Everyone cannot always be&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hunt continues. Restating the problem, find x and y elements of the
natural numbers such that y-on-x minimizes the number of unfufilled
slots. The problem, of course, gets more interesting when you allow the
number of slots and signals to varry. Sadly, that is beyond the scope of
this&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I know is that I am now wishing I had stayed in my group theory&amp;nbsp;class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had this dream last night that featured most of my friends from Morgan
Hill. We were trying to build a pier out of 2x4s ala Jason Christopher
style. Everyone was their current age and in their current relationships
(mostly). I remember swimming around a lot and treading water while
Julie Sullivan was there hitting me on the sole of my foot with the nail
end of her nail board. I asked Jason to make her stop after my pleas
went&amp;nbsp;unheeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General is still in the fog, however, much more has been revealed.
He no has a map of the area and a fighting chance for some of the
company to survive if he can navigate his way out of this gauntlet of

to post the sentence of the last post of each month, December excluded.
That makes this list very short. You will&amp;nbsp;live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;August: I mean maybe not to Heinleinian depths&amp;#8230;but at least a little.&lt;/div&gt;

entirely unexpected as I added some of them as friends and they in

&lt;p&gt;For the old guard: These, naturally, enough are my friends in Austin. I
believe some general references have been made to them&amp;nbsp;already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new: Welcome! This has previously been my place to keep in
contact with some old friends. However, I welcome the new readership and
the changes it implies. If you haven&amp;#8217;t noticed already, most (half-ish,
the other half being babble) of the information is loosely encrypted and
intended toward specific individuals with the information capable of
decrypting what I have written. With the addition of you there will
likely be some posts directed towards you. However, now that you are
here, any possible post about you will be more obscurely written as to
throw you off, if this is the desired effect. If you manage to decrypt a
message, through actual knowledge or a lucky guess or otherwise, and you
feel it was something that was not intended for you, then you should pat
yourself on the back. Furthermore, if you do this, you are wholly
expected to keep this accomplishment to yourself. I do not want to hear
about it nor field questions on it. There are other, more time honored
ways to get information out of me. I am beyond the childhood state of
directly answering questions about anything other than my many and
varied Academic pursuits. That said,&amp;nbsp;enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came on here to say that I feel that whenever people have an easy or a
difficult way to do things, if they sat down and thoght about the
situation, most people will instincually do things the difficult way. (I
am not free from guilt on this) This is really frustrating&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, as you may know, am having roommate problems and these people make
every possible move to put them in my bad graces. I think they like to
see if they can get a rise out of me. I am doing well to ignore them,
usually, to their faces. However, they are giving me emotional
flashbacks to a time when two of my closest friends killed themselves in
haste. I do not need this stress in my life. I do not need this drama in
my life. I am one of the more reslient people out there. If I wasn&amp;#8217;t
then I would not have survived. If I had not come here to Austin, I
doubt I would have made it. I certainly wouldn&amp;#8217;t have in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that I will always lead an unsatisfied life. This is positive in
the sense that it drives me, it is my method for perserverance in the
face of extreme challenges such as Graduate School. However it leaves me
bitter and&amp;nbsp;unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see all of the uplifting posts comming out of Thanksgiving and know
not whether this is a sign of a positive turn of events or just more
evidence that I walk a seperate&amp;nbsp;path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, it is likely time that I sought out a therapist again.
(note: all paragraphs have started with &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;s. Signifigant? No; chance.)
All-in-all I am doing ok, this was just a rant. I am kinda sad and
lonely, and The people I know here, don&amp;#8217;t yet know me well enough to be

explanation here before moving on the the dare-I-say content of this
post. She was an eminant scholar and otherwise academic person in the
1950s and 1960s. I found out about her a couple of months ago from Kerry
sending me an article which included some of her diary&amp;nbsp;entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work of that gave Susan her permenant residence in Academe is
entitled &amp;#8220;Against Interpretation.&amp;#8221; Having read this I woud say that it
has influenced me as much as other life-changing works fr me such as
Socrates&amp;#8217; Apology and Neil Stephenson&amp;#8217;s Cryptonomicon. &amp;#8220;Against
Interpretation&amp;#8221; deals with one of the previously troubling aspects of my
knowledge: Art. For a few years now I have not ben satisfied with my
understanding of Art. I first realized that I did not understand what
Art was about my sophmore year of undergraduate studies. I thus went
around and asked those various producers of the subject what it was. The
answer was consistenly vauge. &amp;#8220;It is what I make.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;It is many things to
every viewer.&amp;#8221; While these may have been true, it is not satifying.
Furthermore, they may not be true. I felt that for something that has
sch effort dedicaed to it for so long, there must be more substance to
such a&amp;nbsp;discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subtext to all response I ever recieved, even if not explicitly
pointed out, was that Art is fundementaly subjective. A work is produced
and even if it portrays one thing and is meant to coax out a certain
emotion, it is the viewer, the consumer who always decides what the
product yeilds for themself. Susun Sontag, however, through breif
illustration of historical thought, points out that the interpratation
of Art is a relatively modern phenomenon. And even more recently was the
advent of Art being self-aware. That is to say Art is now aware of its
own interpreattion and being prodced with the interpretation in mind.
This serves to promote Interpretation&amp;#8217;s near stanglehold on the whole of
Art. Art is now made to be&amp;nbsp;interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Sontag claims that before Art was interpreted and formulated and
stylized it was first experianced for what it was. This still happens.
Whenever one approaches a work of Art, before ones cognative processes
are allowed to decompose a peice, on must first experiance&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will now make a leap (which I will take as an axiom, although I am
sure there are deeper levels and more meaningful assumptions that can be
made). I invite the reader to recall their Heidegger. For Heidegger, in
a temporally independent universe, dasein was the most fundemantal
aspect of an object. A being&amp;#8217;s physical existance is what matters. This
is typically thought to be in direct opposition, or at least a passing
alternate, to the Aristotillian veiw where the soul engenders the
physical existance and renders the world meaningful. I claim that an
existance in a localized region for a finite amount of time is an
experiance. I will make no effort here to back up my&amp;nbsp;claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art as an experiance is aesthetic. One&amp;#8217;s perception of a work of Art,
while still subjective from the point of view that the veiwer
experiances it, is not open to interpritation. Ms. Sontag points out
that some Art is more subject to the rigors of interpreattion than
others. Painting and Literature are among the most interparted works.
Film at the begining and Dance and Orchestral music are some of the less
interpreted and much more experiential. Now, in this age, we can add
Video Games as an emerging experiential artform. As an Art, most video
games undergo little to no interpetation, much like movies, and are not
treated as art. I expect that this mentality is changing and that within
the next 20 years we will see and to some extent have already seen
concepts such as Autuership and possibly even a Classical Japaneese Game
come&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, other forms of purely experiential art have arisen since the
writing of &amp;#8220;Against Interpretation.&amp;#8221; The advent of Non-linear, Chaotic,
and Fractal Mathematics has added art which can be nothing but
experiential. Many people have called various fractals, like the
Mandelbrot set and its variotions like the Buhdabrot set, Art. Let us
suppose that such works are indeed art. If so, then they are certainly
not produced by any one person. This shouldn&amp;#8217;t bother us since most Art
is made by a collective, especially the more technilogically advanced
ones. On teh other end, the fractal art is neither produced by anyone at
all! Instead, the math that forumlates these graphics could have been
written down at anytime prior to its initial disover and will remain
producable in the same way irrespective of who produces it. Fractal art
is infinitely&amp;nbsp;availible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artists have long claimed that they were merely vessles. They translate
messages the gods gave them into their work. No wisdom, no
interpretation. They were simply the method used to create; artists were
not the creators. This task of becoming the perfect spiritual medium has
now been acomplished. However, it was not done by an artist. Instead,
mathematics happened to fall on something that was then experianced. And
when this newfound methodology was experianced, it was experianced as
Art. What is more is that it would be proposterous to say that fractals
are meant to be interpreted for the same reason that it would be silly
to say that experiancing nature is saying something about humanity or
any other abstracts. Nature is real; it is neither implicit or explicit.
Like existance and experiance, nature is inescapable. There are ways to
relate these fundemantals to concepts, but that is beyond my scope here.
What is important is the distinction. Mathematicians achieved what Art
found it couldn&amp;#8217;t and then abandoned. However, in this process Math
became&amp;nbsp;Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, Art is an experiance. Since, the time of Susan Sontag, new
and different forms of art have been produced. What is more, these new
forms are, while not free from interpretation due to the imbeded
mentality of Artists and critics, at least adverse to interprataion for
the moment and are free to be experianced in the raw brutality of their
own existance. Art may be free to be what it&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt really
down on friday because I work had basicly eaten my soul the week before.
Friday was much better though because I met this group of people calling
themselves the Austin Cosplay Defense Force. And low and behold most of
them were women!&amp;nbsp;Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So life was good and then came Saturday basicly sucked the lifeout of
me. I played HackMaster in the mornign and tried to convince the post
office not to send back my package to Houston for the second time to no
avail. Then I went and hung out with Seekatz and Robin and Patrick and
had an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; time but was still very stressed and tired and lost what could
have been my first win at scrabble. The only truly good thing to happen
was that we went to Dragon&amp;#8217;s Landing and I *was* going to blow the 50
bucks on the &amp;#8220;Game of Thrones&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPG&lt;/span&gt;. However, they where closed and I
kept my money in my moment of&amp;nbsp;weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday was another story. Sunday, October 29th, was Syd&amp;#8217;s Birthday. It
is funny how some dates stick with you. Instead of this being an
all-to-gether negative day, though I had originally planned it as such,
I choose over the High Holy Days to pursue an as of then unthought of
positive path and at that time pursued it. I was still left with a
feeling of axiety. However, there was a Record (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LP&lt;/span&gt;. Vinal, etc.)
Convention on Sunday and I went. I spent the money I didn&amp;#8217;t spend on a
silly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPG&lt;/span&gt; book on buying records. Mostly I bought a lot of Zappa and
Zappa related material, but I spent a fair amount collecting things that
I missed from Syd&amp;#8217;s modest collection. Also on Sunday, as some of you
may have noticed, I put &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.scopatz.com/"&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt; back on the intar-web-net. This
involved putting it on my new old machine. I also in this process threw
out the old iMac that Syd&amp;#8217;s parents gave me that I was running my site
on formerly. I also went to Ross and bought some black socks in the
stead my white gym ones. Sunday was very much a day when I replaced
things in my life Syd related and thereby replaced her and all-in-all
was a positive&amp;nbsp;experiance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Then! Today I woke up and wanted to die and then went and worked for
12&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is a new&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

your computer, at least if you are running&amp;nbsp;linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reboot your life and in the process of bring up all of the necissary
system functions you get little [ok] or [failed] messages and then move
on to the next step. But you really do start from the ground up and as
things come on line you feel more and more comfortable with the place.
And I am saying this as a person who finds moving to a new place
relatively&amp;nbsp;easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have observed that my behavior here has been that of making certain
goals, achiving them and then moving on to the next goal. The first was
obviously moving in and feeling comfortable and obtaining all of the
furniture I need to feel like a &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; person. Then, I got my school
situation adequately up and running. The next was finding a group of
people to game with. After that came the establishment of one or two
stable friend groups. Now I am left with two goals that like the gaming
group and friend group in some sense run&amp;nbsp;concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must discover what sort of ways in which I wish to improve myself and
pursue these in my spare time and I must find a suitable mate for the
Austin area. I hate to chalk things up to chance so I won&amp;#8217;t. I figure
since my self improvement goals include finding new people to exersize
with (which is a shame I left &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SB&lt;/span&gt; since I had found again a good group of
people thanks to the Garden Court Apt.) I will do this one first. This
goal should impove my desirability to the potential in theory. I feel
the last system critical function to boot up are always the ones that
give you the most trouble since you have already developed something of
a routine. What I need now is&amp;nbsp;perserverance!!!&lt;/p&gt;

ReiserFS in the dust really bothers&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;

people and experiances but I will keep everything&amp;nbsp;clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I am going to tell everyone about my supercool HackMaster game.
So I think I mentioned that my campaign had too many players for one
game and instead we have formed two parties that will coexist. Well, it
got even wilder. So we have 12 slots open but a potential 14 players so
I am forced to come up with ways to get players to leave the game
tactfully! How nutso is&amp;nbsp;that?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Evil Party is really hyped and definitely my type of role-players.
The party thusfar is made up of one Mute Monk, a Bounty Hunter, a Wild
Mage and a Blood Mage. They are so screwed until they get a Cleric, and
they know it. On the other hand they know they will have to be creative
to solve most problems. Also, It is nice that they all understand that
they can&amp;#8217;t be Stupid Evil and are prepared to rock my&amp;nbsp;socks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good party still needs to get fully up and running but I am hoping
to play sometime with them sometime this week. Their theoretical makeup
is a monk, thief, cleric, ranger, and some sort of magic&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Campaign has the potential to be my Magnum Opus. It would be hard
to top this set up. There is just &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOOOOO&lt;/span&gt; much fun stuff you can do when
yuo are playing one group off of another that is simply not doable with
one party. Also, I am positive that it makes the game much much more
interesting for the players since less of the creative output they see
is coming directly and only from me. Also since I am blatantly stealing
characters (with justification) from at least 3 other campaigns as
initial main NPCs, I am certain that helps increase the creative
content. These players are really in for a treat like no&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so nice too, being able to design campaigns with contingents. The
sucess or faliure of one party with thier tasks can and will have direct
effects on the game world that the other party sees when they play. In
addition, to make things suitable ambiguous, the parties may
occasionalyl have the same goal but for different reasons, goals which
can only be achieved through their cooperation&amp;#8230;which would rock since
I am going to give them suitable enough reasons to be&amp;nbsp;enimies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after the goal is achieved&amp;#8230;Battle&amp;nbsp;Royale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be spectacular. Keeping the parties roughly balanced will be
the hard part. But really if that is the least of your worries, you are
sitting&amp;nbsp;pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok Ok, I know, I know, a total groaner. You laughed on the inside. So I
just got back from Spider House where I went through a cheese shop
senario. I had to order three drinks before they had any of them. But I
eventually sat down with my matgerita and settled into rereading
Lysistrata. It is so funny and very interesting. I had totally forgotten
about the part where some of the women initially object to the plan with
a series of &amp;#8220;What ifs?&amp;#8221; One of them was, &amp;#8220;What if they should take it by
force?&amp;#8221; To which Lysistrata replies, &amp;#8220;Submit, but in a bad grace. There
is no pleasure in that which is taken.&amp;#8221; or somesuch. To my mind that
seems like such a sophisticated response. Not so much in the phrasing of
it but more that such a tactic would sucee against the average&amp;nbsp;joe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also one of the footnotes noted that appearently Athens utilized
Scythian Archers on their police force! How Bad-Ass is that? It almostr
makes me wonder if this is a source of Athena&amp;#8217;s weapon being the bow
(probably not, but it is a cute parrallel&amp;nbsp;nonetheless.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to contiune the tour of greek women, I saw a couple of girls at the
cafe who were clearly proud of their heritage , being from the island of
Lesbos. (Neither of them looked greek &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt;) Most of the time when you see
couples in general, one person is hot and the other isn&amp;#8217;t so much so ya
know. Well these were two blessed girls. One still wasn&amp;#8217;t my type but
they were evenly matched I&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;

I know what you are going to say so
I&amp;#8217;ll start off with &amp;#8220;It was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt; bad.&amp;#8221; Alright we are now all on the
same page. However, there were some positive aspects which I&amp;#8217;ll get to
later. To start off with I picked a realitively inocuous seat in the
middle. Three spaces from anyone to the right and pleanty of room on the
left. But No. Three teenie boppers rolled up and sat right in those
three. Keep in mind that there was pleanty of other room in the
thearter. The one girl to my left asked durring previews for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ME&lt;/span&gt; to kick
the seat of the chair in front of me where a 20ish couple was making
out. I naturally refused and then they said loudly &amp;#8220;There will be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;
making out durring the film&amp;#8221;. Which clearly embarssed this young couple.
They then proceeded to talk the whole movie about how hot each guy was.
What the&amp;nbsp;Hell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you know nothing about the film know that it was produced by the
same people who did &amp;#8220;Underworld&amp;#8221; but instead of vampires/werewolves,
there was a group of four psions who had basicly sworn off their powers.
But no there is a secert fifth psion who comes and obviously wants to
kill the main (read most powerful) character. The last half of the film
is those two going Kameha-Meha back and forth. I expected it to be
better than Underworld because frankly Underworld was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt; bad++. But
no. I was&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my good friends Myers and Briggs pulled through once again. To
my pleasant suprise out of the four heros, each one displayed obvious
characteristics of one of the four temperments, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NT&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NF&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SJ&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt;. The main
character, while still kind of a douche was clearly the &amp;#8216;thinker&amp;#8217; of the
group and gets &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NT&lt;/span&gt; status easily. The best friend of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MC&lt;/span&gt; was the more
emotional one and was identifiably an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NF&lt;/span&gt;. The one who got his rocks off
annoying the main character showed a naturaly tendancy towards ideals
matching him as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt;. Now the last one, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SJ&lt;/span&gt;, we didn&amp;#8217;t see much of.
But this may be the most important aspect of SJness. They realy don&amp;#8217;t
make good subjects of stories (unless you are Hemingway (which would
have made this movie genius!)). He basicly hung around with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt; and
did what the smarter/more charismatic characters told him to do. At the
start of the movie I was hoping that they would do the whole four
horsemen of the apocolypse thing&amp;#8230;but having identifiable temperment
was pretty good too. In some sense, this even makes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHC&lt;/span&gt; movies easier to
predict, because you can not only indetify major plot and story elements
way before they happen but you can also from scene to scene predict what
characters will say to each other. And since you already know waht
scenes there will&amp;nbsp;be&amp;#8230;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one line which really took the cake. A doctor, a medical
doctor, you know the kind that know about life forms and all, said this
&amp;#8220;It is as if she was bitten by hundreds of insects, like spiders.&amp;#8221; Now
the man on the street might not find much wrong with this peice of
dialouge. But we are discerning here, no? Spiders are not insects. At
least it was worth a laugh. There was other stuff wrong with the
film&amp;#8230;but that took the proverbial&amp;nbsp;cake.&lt;/p&gt;

Only after
my last post did I admit to myself that I was actually sick. My inner
ear had been all messed up and I was inflamed underneath my jaw. I
basiclly went home as soon as I could and passe dout for four hours. I
took yesterday off and just played WoW all day. I know, pitiful. I was
about to go out many time but I was really calling that one in.
Conseqeuntlly, I felt much better&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today however, I have just returned from my 12 hour extravaganda into
the world. First I went to Costco and bought some shelving so I can
finally stop living out of boxes for once in my life. Tomorrow I get to
unpack, Yeah!! It is the little things ya know. Then I went to Thor&amp;#8217;s
Hammer. If you are having trouble, this is one of the local gaming
store. There is an open to the public D&amp;amp;D game here. We ran through the
first part of converted 2nd Ed mod. Very fun. Afterwords, Je (pronounced
Jay)(from the game) and I went to a pub downtown to watch a free showing
of &amp;#8220;V for Vendetta&amp;#8221;. Suprisingly poingent. I must say I really liked it
a whole lot. I almost feel bad for saying this beacsue it was such a
philisophical film (Aesthetics is Philosophy, Ha!) but Natalie Portman
with no hair is Hot. Hott I daresay. Hawt! Ok enough of that. A lot of
interesting moral dilemas with no right answers and a ton of char.
development. The Wisochi Bros. may be redeemed yet. It also was funny
that the main villan looked a lot like Syd&amp;#8217;s dad. Je and I spent the
next couple hours walking around downtow. Had a couple beers. Good
times. I didnot intend on being out all night but hey, who can deny a
fun&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;This test measured you according to four criteria: Philosophy, Pride,
Involvement and Citizen&amp;nbsp;Status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Philosophy&lt;/em&gt; reflects whether you agree with the philosophical
foundations of the United States, such as: liberty, equality, democracy
(though limited, not absolute), capitalism, checks and balances,
constitutionalism,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pride&lt;/em&gt; reflects your assessment of the factual reality and history of
the United States as a nation. It is your opinion as to whether the
United States has been a &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; country and whether it has acted rightly
or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Involvement&lt;/em&gt; reflects your level of political activism&amp;#8212;whether you act
to stay informed of what is going on in the world, and what you do on
the basis of that&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citizen Status&lt;/em&gt; simply reflects whether you claimed to be a citizen of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; when asked by this&amp;nbsp;test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the opinion of this test that, of these four factors, the only one
that matters when it comes to being considered a Patriotic American is
one&amp;#8217;s score in the first category&amp;#8212;Philosophy. Therefore, if you scored
between 0-33% in that category, you have been rated &amp;#8216;Unpatriotic&amp;#8217;;
34-66%, &amp;#8216;Somewhat Patriotic&amp;#8217;; 67-100%&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;Patriotic&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the other categories provide interesting information for your
(and others&amp;#8217;) consideration. However, they are not crucial for
Patriotism, and they do not necessarily reflect a love, or its lack, for
one&amp;#8217;s country. Regarding &lt;em&gt;American Pride&lt;/em&gt;, some people will be surprised
that it does not affect the outcome of the test; some people will be
upset by this. However, if a person supports every military action the
United States has ever engaged in, but does not really support his
neighbors&amp;#8217; right to live their lives in the ways that they see fit, then
they do not truly love the United States. Further, and despite much of
the rhetoric some political pundits engage in, a truly Patriotic
American can be highly critical of many of the actions undertaken by the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; throughout history. Certainly, much of what the United States has
done has been done poorly or for the wrong reasons. And while the author
of this test believes that the United States has been mainly a force for
good in the world (and the most-free, best nation ever to exist), he
respects the opinions of those who would disagree with him and fully
supports their right to dissent. For that is what America is all&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;em&gt;Involvement&lt;/em&gt;, it has been said that eternal vigilance is the
price of liberty. This is true, however it is also true that liberty
means that people can be as involved, or not involved, as they want.
Choosing not to vote, while perhaps unwise, is as much an exercise of
political liberty as anything else. Certainly, however, a low score in
involvement might mean that a person could stand to try to be more aware
of current events, or more actively involved in shaping them, because
sometimes they&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;em&gt;Citizen Status&lt;/em&gt;, I am certain that many people will believe
that to truly be a Patriotic American, one must be a citizen of the
United States. However, that is not so. One of the traits that sets the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; apart from many other nations in history, is that it is a country
not organized specifically around a particular ethnicity, language,
religion, culture or common historical origin, but a shared political
ideology. The United States is organized around a common love of
liberty, individual rights and free expression. This, in part, accounts
for the unending stream of immigration starting from the very conception
of the nation and continuing on to the present day. In today&amp;#8217;s United
States, there are many thousands who are not citizens, and yet who live
in the United States and share its dreams (and many of them will be
citizens when they are able). The author would even argue that there are
many Patriotic Americans who have never yet even set foot on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; soil.
There are no requirements of language, skin color, religion, sexual
orientation or particular condition of any other personal detail to be a
&amp;#8220;true American.&amp;#8221; Just a love of&amp;nbsp;liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that the test was either entertaining, educational or some
combination of the two. I appreciate your taking it. If you have any
serious question/comment, the author is always glad to discuss this
subject or any other (though please keep in mind my initial
warnings&amp;#8212;you knew what this test was about when you decided to take
it). Also, you might want to check out some of my other tests if you&amp;#8217;re

I got not one, but two roommates&amp;#8230;which
means slightly more for&amp;nbsp;rent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their names are Josh and Eliot. They are the Social networking types.
Not ness. the people I wanna live with my whole four years here, but
they Definitely know other people and I will surely be introduced to new
and exciting crowds though them. Very amiable&amp;#8230;excessively so&amp;nbsp;even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, I went to this really cool documentary, once again outside
a coffe shop, called &amp;#8220;Dildo Diaries&amp;#8221;. It was all about the Texas Sodomy
and Obscenity Laws. Better than the film (which was amazing by the way)
was the number of drop dead gorgeous girls there. I litereally could not
keep track of the number of women I could easily spend the rest of my
life looking at. There were at least six girls there all with short hair
and kinda mousey faces and just beautiful builds. Unfortunately, I think
the hottest one was barely underage as she was also the daughter of the
owner of the coffe shop. There was a girl therewho sat next to me who
whore 1920s man wear (stripped pants, white shirt, vest, tie) which I
find to be about the hottest thing a girl can put on. I told her I liked
the cut of her jib, and she said thanks and that afterwards she was
going to a dressup get togther. I also thought I saw someone who I have
been in coorospondence with on OKCupid at the&amp;nbsp;flick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I came home and my new roommates invited me out to 6th street
with them. I accepted and made friends with Uli, a German Comp Sci
person into&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, a good&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;

being shown by the French Alliance. The movie was really funny. It is
about an 11th (although the costumes were more 14th) century Knight and
his squire who want to go back in time to correct a wrong the night did
by shooting this barron in the head with a crossbow (he was drugged by a
witch). Instead, of course, they end up in the 20th century. Very Star&amp;nbsp;Trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, due to some malfunction they couldn&amp;#8217;t get the subtitles to
work. But I stayed anyways and watched the whole film. It is amazing how
much information you can still get out of a film even though you can
only catch one out of every 20 words and that is&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Mossiuer&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any event, you should try it sometime&amp;#8230;or see that movie. Either&amp;nbsp;works&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I will have a roommate soon though. Also the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELO&lt;/span&gt; cover band
concert I thought I was going to today is actually not until tomorrow
which sucks. Oh well. I should probably do more chores now like run out
and get some groceries and find a telephone&amp;#8230;but that is too much

however, there is a cute girl with blue streaks in there hair. I really
shouldn&amp;#8217;t say girl since she looks 2-6 years my senior. However she is
busy flirting with an coworker of clear Irish&amp;nbsp;descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was kinda a non day, and today is poised to be the same. I
forgot Costco doesn&amp;#8217;t take credit cards and felt like a big jerk when I
had to walk away from my&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did see &amp;#8220;Snakes on a Plane&amp;#8221; However. Super funny. It is clear to me
that the internet contributions of this movie made it so much better
than it would have been otherwise. Also the main villian looked
suprisingly like Eric Ballo and had a simillar weapon choice. Go Fig&amp;nbsp;^_^&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; any event my place for the day are to go to a thrift shop and buy
myself a tie and maybe a hat and maybe a vest and definitely a pocket
watch if I can find one. Then I might go to the Sexuality seminar if I
can find and do some food shopping and definetly go see a late showing
of Snakes on a Plane. My God I can&amp;#8217;t escape internet culture even when I
don&amp;#8217;t have internet for a week and a half. Like this morning I got up

We basiclly spnt all day
mulling around waiting for the real estate agent to call. Not that we
didn&amp;#8217;t call him of course. But the paperwork has been held up on the
other peoples end and while we were suppossed to close on friday somehow
that got delayed until today, monday. This again, because they did not
finish, was held up until tomorrow. Now, we are suppossed to meet them,
of course, not in the morning but at 2 in the afternoon. Theses guys are
relly lagging and it is pissin&amp;#8217; me off. We arived on Sunday which was a
day late. Now we have been delayed an extra two days while in Austin.
Everyone&amp;#8217;s nervousness is simply feededing everyone else&amp;#8217;s. So moving in
to my new place and thus getting situated is now being forstalled until
tomorrow afternoon. Which in all likelyhood means that I won&amp;#8217;t even get
internet by my birthday. The phone situation at my new place is, believe
it or not as complicated as getting the new place. Everything is a
headache. When it is said that purchasing a home can shave years off
your life, I believe it. Whatever happened o the good &amp;#8216;ole days of
homesteading where if you wanted a peice of land you would just kill who
was ever on it. There are some nice houses in The City that I would
like&amp;#8230;maybe near Golden Gate&amp;nbsp;Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck tomorrow. (must buy pocketwatch&amp;#8230;I am so much less cool
without&amp;nbsp;one)&lt;/p&gt;

out here I decided that I would like to start a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LJ&lt;/span&gt; and hopefully it
won&amp;#8217;t take the bitter tatse th old one did nor will it end as
catastrophiclly as the old one. In any event, since this seems to be

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNCOMFORTABLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SURVEY&lt;/span&gt;. (lets see if you can get through it. if not,
you&amp;#8217;re too scared about your&amp;nbsp;past)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Longest relationship: 2 and a half&amp;nbsp;years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Shortest relationship: Kerry Vineberg, a quarter and a&amp;nbsp;half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-How many boyfriends/girlfriends have told you that they love you?: At
least 2, no more than&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you ever thought that you were going to marry the person you were
with?: No, Hell&amp;nbsp;No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you ever loved someone so much that it hurt?: No, these emotions
don&amp;#8217;t really work together with me. If I am hurting because of somewhere
then I love them less&amp;#8230;I&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you ever made a boyfriend or girlfriend cry?: All of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you ever cried over a boyfriend or girlfriend?: Yes, but the tears
were lost in the&amp;nbsp;dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Are you happier single or in a relationship?: I am definitely satiated
in a relationship in a way that I am not outside of one. Also, when not
in near constant sexually overtoned physical contact I am put in a bad
humour. Some, I daresay most, relationships are not&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you ever cheated on a boyfriend or girlfriend?:&amp;nbsp;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you ever been cheated on?: Oh Definitely. It seems to be a pattern
in&amp;nbsp;fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-What is your favorite thing about the opposite sex?:&amp;nbsp;Estrogen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-What is your favorite thing about the same sex?:&amp;nbsp;Comraderie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you ever had your heart broken?: Yes and it as driven me to&amp;nbsp;drink&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you ever broken someones heart?: I think so, In fact I think the
only time people walked away relatively satisfied was Kerry Moore. If
not That was definelty the&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Talk to any of your exes?: People named Kerry haved turned out top be
top of their class. From their respective schools they are some of the
only people I keep in contact with from said schools. Dionne; No. Jessie
I contacted every once and a while for 4 years or so but we have
basiclly fell off by now. I hope she is allright. Sydney I trust will
get her just returns. If not by me then by something else. I wish I
could say I do not ever intend to talk to her&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-If you could go back in time and change things to where you could still
be with one of your exes, would you?: Hard to say. Probably&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Think any of your exes feel the same way?: Yes I&amp;#8217;d say they all would
answer about how I&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Do you believe that you are a good boyfriend or girlfriend?: I think I
have a good foundation. I have had enough Experiance to know who I am
and what I what out of a relationship, and when to cut it off, and what
my faults are and how to manage them. I tell every new person all of
this very early on. But I have found that even knowing and accepting and
haing had the other person know and accept does not mean that the
relationship will be successful. If the other party does not know
themselves nor how to change themselves as needed then it is ultimately
doomed. Furthermore these qualities are typically deeply covered up by
the other&amp;nbsp;party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you dated people who were not good to you?: Yes but only Dionne
and Syndey. Dionne I only&amp;nbsp;suspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you been in an abusive relationship?: Not&amp;nbsp;physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Name your most memorable ex: The one I most remember is naturally
Sydney; The most memorable is&amp;nbsp;Jessie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Have you dated someone older then you?: Yes. by about a&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Younger? Yes. by about a&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Do you regret anything that you have done with a boyfriend or
girlfriend?: I assume this means physically. So no. Emotionally very
much so. Once again with all of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-When is the last time that you were in a relationship? 4 months&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Do you believe everyone deserves a second chance?: Fuck No. Especially
if you are their second&amp;nbsp;chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Believe in love at first sight?: I believe in hottness at first&amp;nbsp;sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ever dated two people at once?: Not&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ever been given a promise ring? If this is what I think it is then&amp;nbsp;yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Do you want to get married?: Undecided&amp;#8230;The Academia makes it&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Do you have something to say to any of your exes? If you are a terrible
person, or are dating a terrible person. Please contact me when you die
so I may dance on your graves when you&amp;nbsp;die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ever stolen someones boyfriend or girlfriend?:&amp;nbsp;Nope&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Ever liked someone elses boyfriend or girlfriend?: Sure, almost all of
them. I have yet to act on such carnal desires&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Do you believe in true love?: If true means true, unadultered romance
then yes, but only in the short&amp;nbsp;term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Does heartbreak really feel as bad as it sounds?: Must&amp;nbsp;kill&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

However,&amp;#8230;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let
me reiterate. This is a Private Journal. It is strictly read at your

response. Through reading &amp;#8220;Please Understand Me&amp;#8221;, I understand that a
lot (about 40%) of people can only have a knee-jerk response. I am
capable of more as are most of my friends. If you feel uncomfortable
about this site, understand that this is NOt how I necessarily feel or
think about people. Only what I think. Would you dare venture into the
inner workings of anothers mind? Do you even think about yours? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This
takes a skilled proffesional, of which I am not. However I am being
introspective and am thinking about my thoughts and this helps. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUCKING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAFE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HERE&lt;/span&gt;!!!! &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MEANS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;!!!! &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUCK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUT&lt;/span&gt;!!!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Brendan, Jon, Kerry, If this journal is too disruptive to you and your life I beg of you do not read.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syd,
This ceratinly was not intended for you. But am I suppossed to
apologize because you snuck into my closet and think my dity closes
smell? I think not. Besides it is impossible to determine who soiled
this landaury in the first place. Whoever pointed you here, if they did
so knowing you are an introvert, then they only did so to hurt you. If
this was me, then it is pretty obvious that some part of me wants to
hurt you and this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUCKING&lt;/span&gt; Journal is how I control it. What do you want
from me..to join a convent. Do you really want me to physically attack
you or dan? I don&amp;#8217;t. Give me some outlet and stop torturing me by
trying to change me into you without giving back at all! If you are
upset abou the emails, know they were for my therapist. Oh wait&amp;#8230;a
holier than thou moment coming&amp;#8230;.At least I don&amp;#8217;t involve any friends
in a relationship who can be affected by it. This may be an exageration
but&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;Hmmm Dan, should I break up with Tony and instead suck &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOUR&lt;/span&gt;
cock?&amp;#8221; Dan may have the capasity to be rational but he still thinks
with his dick and not his head or heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like everyone
to please note that I have never, ever said an unkind word about Syd or
Dan. To me only actions count. This is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MY&lt;/span&gt; stream of conciousness..not
yours. This does not count as an action anymore than thinking these
thoughts and keepeing them bottled up or telling Dr. Wax. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whenever
anyone has ever said &amp;#8220;Syd, what a bitch&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Oh I used to like Dan&amp;#8221; I
have always defended you two. I have always encouraged my friends to
come to their own conclutions and Know that I, despite everything,
wanted to remain their friend. If truly pressured I have always told
the truth, which is that I feel betrayed by both but for some dumb
reason I still feel Syd has value in my life. Even now; this very
moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I know that my thoughts if ever expressed would only
drive Syd and Dan Closer. Watch as it does. What did I do to desvere
such total and utter rejection from two who once called me friend? To
my mind, very little. To express such thoughts is not publiclly
acceptable. As intimate as two people get, it is still public. This,
fortunately is not the public in any local sense&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It interests me
that Syd would suddenly, after I broke off contact with her, be
interested in how I am thinking. For the last year and a half of our
relationship she showed no inkling or care at all to what I was
thinking or even how I was feeling. Wanting to be alone in my grief di
not mean that I didn&amp;#8217;t love her and she was wrong to think so. If you
are still reading then It means you are a Voyer and I hold no duty to
you. I feel no social kindness to not offend. This is my mind and not
yours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I realize that things I associate in my mind with Syd and
Dan still hold value apart from them. I hope they do the same. I also
understand that I inherited the Dan curse and can only pray it has run
its course. I fear that with this speci-man it has only just begun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I have rejected the more nerdy activities which make them such losers now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syd
would only make such an incendiary post about me on her live journal if
she still cared about me in some manner. Clearly the number of posts on
mine about her indicates that I still care about her. I think a lot of
her anger comes out of her being rejected by me. She had yet to be
dumped. Now she in some small faction knows how it feels. What must
really kill her about all this is that I haven&amp;#8217;t gone off the deepend
and called her anything crazy like a &amp;#8220;pedophile&amp;#8221;. I really did cut off
contact with her because I felt it was in my emotional best interest,
which is something akin to why she broke up with me and started going
out with Dan. Life works in mysteroious ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Self-Referential
of the day: Posting about how stupid it makes a person when they have a
Holier-than-thou post, makes your post Holier-Than-Thou and thus you
just as stupid.

Well, I did it.  It was hard to do, but easier than expected.

&lt;!--
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I told Syd in not so many words that I don&amp;#8217;t think we can be friends
right now. What I actually said was more along the lines of &amp;#8220;I think it
is in my best interest if we stop contacting each other.&amp;#8221; We made it
through the rest of lunch without any arguments or screaming or crying.
She thought the Picture I painted for her yesterday with me in a rocket
going to mars was about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;. Little did she know. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a while
now everyone from Shawn to Dr. Wax to Tara has been saying that it
would be good for me to cut off contact. This realization came slowly
to me. Ultimately it is that Syd did not start treating me any better
after the breakup. Instead she still wanted me to think well of her no
matter how she treated me. I was not game for that in our relationship
and I reacted by being apathetic towards her when she did that. Oddly
that apathy was her main reason for ending our relationship. Now
however it was my turn to end the relationship because of her
distateful behavior. This behavior essentially is that she was treating
me as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EX&lt;/span&gt; and not a friend. She would purposelfy (consious of it or
no) bring up sensitive topics and anger me. It was always a crapshoot
as to whether she would treat me well on a given day or not, both in
and out of our reltionship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This all started because she could
not, can not (and this may be a function of her personality type more
than anything, which is why I hold out hope for the future that she
will settle down and stablize in one personality type and be able to
accept that rather than being internally torn), treat me as an equal.
She could &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; accept the fact that I was depressed about my family, I
knew I was depressed, and she could not trust me when I said I knew how
to work it out on my own but that I also just needed her faithful
support not her advice. For some unknown reason this pissed off her
inner psyche and she still doesn&amp;#8217;t know what to do with me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like
Sean or Garrick or Nick or Meenon or Josh (Noel) or Mowi &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Kai, Syd
is family. I feel like my mom must have felt about Shane after he
turned them into Child Protective Services. In the end, I think
everything will work out, but I have done all that I can for now. For
whatever reason, Syd has rejected me. There is nothing I can safely do
but give her the rejection she so desires.
&amp;#8212;&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fell bad about this.  
On the other hand, now I am truly single&amp;#8230;.Hellooooo Ladies!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

Sooo the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SB&lt;/span&gt; crowd has started to find out about this journal. This will be
interesting. Brendan told me today that he had found it (because I
added him as a friend). He described it as &amp;#8220;intense&amp;#8221;. I should have

became rather decadent for me and I wanted to leave but for Shawn&amp;#8217;s

Ok so I disappered for a few days and I realized that my previous post indicated none of where or why I went.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok
so I was really flustered and after the bullshit of last week so I went
to visit my cousin Andrew and the whole (or what is left) crowd from
the Valley. Here was the beautiful thing about this weekend I only made
two decitions the whole time, when I was to arrive and when I was to
leave. On this trip I really only didn&amp;#8217;t see Racheal (and Other Andrew
of course). I didn&amp;#8217;t see Kai for as long as I&amp;#8217;d like since he was
working. I did get to where this bitchin&amp;#8217; Cowboy hat of Mowi&amp;#8217;s though.
Mowi and Kai now have these three adorable kittens. I love these
people. They are really my friends. I know that they have polotiks
within themselves and I am thankfully not a part of that. However I
feel that even if I was a less transitory member of their friend group
I would still manage to stay mostly out of it. The clear comparriosn I
am making here is Morgan Hill. While I may date someone, I will be the
first and then not terribly embroiled after all is said and done. I
still manage to be a part of them though. I feel I am a trusted friend
of all of them. Andrew and I tend to satisfy the same social niche even
though we have very different life styles. The proximity of our
birthdays (no accident by the way) only enhances the mood that I am
some sort of twin who was seperated. I got to see Josh for a good bit
which is good. He made the hard choice of taking off school to help his
family while his mom recovers from cancer. I am so proud/envious. I
wish I could have made a similar choice. Of coruse, my families
problems were a bit more insidous in terms of timelines of information.
I also saw Eric. He is a great person too. So at one point it was Eric,
Andrew, Josh and I hanging out and I realized that, on some level, we
were all Jewish. Thus the kabalists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I met Andrew 3 or Other
Other Andrew. Seems like an ok guy. He is going to Cal Poly in Physics.
That kinda took me by suprise. Up to then he seemed like the
sterotypical Valley nerd-dork (whole different breed than NorCal trust
me guys&amp;#8230;I&amp;#8217;ve lived both lives). Andrew was noticibly bitter&amp;#8230;as well
he should be, but then why invite them to the movie if it would just
upset you. Once again, I feel trapped into having to let my less
experianced friends make their own dumb relationship mistakes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile,
I realized that, escpecially if I move to TexAss, no one else I ever
meet will meet as my childhood friends. 
&lt;!--
Syd was around long enough to
meet them all basiclly. I had some shitty flashbacks to going down to
the valley with her and Dan. I tried to escape, but escaping into my
past present and future didn't work. Those two are fucking persistent.
Just like family.
--&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And Next weekend I do it all again!  Isn&amp;#8217;t life&amp;nbsp;quaint.

So Yesterday when I woke up I was Graduating but not doing comencement.  
Today I am now doing comencement but not graduating.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stupid System; 
Stupid Man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I
have two blocks on my graduation. The first is that I need to petition
for the physics department to accept 8 units of Upper division Math for
the physics elecive courses. No biggie really (I think) as they already
said they would. The other is this really dumb thing where we have this
writing requirement which means that we have to take 6 classes off of a
dumb list which count as writing classes. I made the mistake of
believing that the classes I took from the Writing Department would
count towards this. Nope. I only have 5 of the six classes. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAAAAME&lt;/span&gt;! So
now I have to petion for some of my Physics lab classes, which have had
an extensive amount of writing in them, to count for this. Almost all
of them work except for this fuzzy 25% of the grade clause. In any
event I am hoping that saying hey I have grad school to go to and so
summer is not an option and at least one of these three classes totally
satisfies your needs and hey &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt; class in my major is on you stupid list
will have them count one of the classes for me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If this doesn&amp;#8217;t happen then 
I am basiclly screwed.  I just wanna get outta here on time&amp;#8230;is that so much to&amp;nbsp;ask?

So I am sitting here at a terminal in the library. It is superbly
beautiful day and I feel well dressed. Perhaps a little too warmly for
this weather. I hope I get to go to Irvine this weekend. Since Other
Andrew can&amp;#8217;t make it out we are looking for alternitive ways to have
fun. With Andrew, of course, this means exploring my more nerdy
pursuits. In all likely hood I will end up raiding with the guild and
then playing some DnD. This might be a nice change of pace for me.
Also, it means I get to see Mowi and seriously, how many more times am
I gonna get to do that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There
is some weird Abortion campaing goingon outside. I am not really sure
what there deal is, but I now know I have an instictual reation to run
when I see a seven foot tall fetus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think I may have relapsed
into caring about the Dan-Syd thing which is bad. This morning was
tough after it hadn&amp;#8217;t been bad for a couple of weeks. It wasn&amp;#8217;t that
bad but I gotta nip it in the bud now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other than that there
is a lot of stress in school right now. Not really in my classes but
more involved with getting out of them. At this point my classes are a
drop in the bucket for the rest of the quarter. However, They are doing
my final requirement check today and I&amp;#8217;ll know tomorrow one way or the
other whether I get to graduate for sure or not. In addition to that,
even though the deadline is next week, I am not able to register for
comencement online. This is bad because it might mean that even though
I will get a degree saying I can talk the talk they might not let me
walk the walk. The people are real slimeballs about it too, just like
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETS&lt;/span&gt; or the College Board. Their website, The Office of Student Events,
only lists their phone number (which leads only to an answering
machine), an email (which no one checks), and a mailing address (which
on a university campus has no relation to the actual location). They
literally make it impossible for you to walk in and ask a quick
question. Brilliantly, however, after visiting the Registar today I
popped by the Visitor&amp;#8217;s Centor on campus and asked them. It turns out
the office isn&amp;#8217;t even on Campus!!! It is at an off campus research
center, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt;! I didn&amp;#8217;t have time to go to my car and go there today but
I will tomorrow. If they don&amp;#8217;t listen to my pleas of &amp;#8220;I paid $100K to
go here, let me walk in the silly ceremony. How many years have you
been doing this again?&amp;#8221; Then I will get my parents (who actually did
pay the 100K) to go in and do the same. It really is the only way
things get done around here. Or in this case, it is the only way things
get done &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; around&amp;nbsp;here.

of leaving in the first place. i have been thinking so much about that
lately&amp;#8230;i so sorely hope to continue to see people into the summer&amp;#8230;&lt;br&gt;i
do, however, continue to think of it as my responsibility. if only i
had been more in touch with my feelings and more realistic we might
have effected a much healthier separation. and if i had had the

happened&amp;#8212;except of course for the pain and suffering of
leaving/graduating&amp;#8230; &lt;br&gt;i am not sure that the solution you hinted
at will ever occur to him, however, especially since he is aware of how
much you seem to prefer avoidance. he would probably feel bad
contacting you even in an apologetic vein. and i do not think it will
occur to him to apologize&amp;#8212;i think he has a strong impression of our
relationship having been pretty painful for me as he was always there
in your room when you gave me the cold shoulder and of course never
there at the moments of our greatest intimacy. so you have to realize
that to a certain extent he usually saw us acting unhappily. if this,
my estimation, is an accurate one of his mindset (and who knows) then
he probably thinks that *you* should apologize instead. maybe I should
tell him that both you and i have apoligized to each other and then he
would understand the complexity of the situation. tell me what you
think about this please&amp;#8212;i won&amp;#8217;t make any move until we&amp;#8217;ve discussed it.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;I guess he was at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; when he thought you were in lab.  he will make a more concerted effort about that if you like.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;i&amp;#8217;m glad i saw you today&amp;#8230;&lt;br&gt;baci,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tony:&lt;br&gt;Dear Syd, My Response:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8221;

violated. You kept it a secret. You lied (includes withholding key
information) about at it to my face. I have, arguably, been through
more relationships than the entire rest of our friend group
(discounting Shawn if you count one night stands). I made it very clear
(I thought) at the beggining that if you were ever thinking about a
relationship with someone else, I would need to be told about it. This
was the opposite of what happened and what had been going on for many
months I suspect. I do not feel bad, therefore for doing the same to
you. However, I may have saved the relationship by telling you but all
things considered I doubt that. He who shall not be named lied many
times to me as well. This only adds to my anger against him. It is one
thing to commit a dishonorabl act, it is another yet again to conceal
it. People in my situation are not stupid. Treating us as such only
makes the situation worse. But we live and learn and my hope is that
you won&amp;#8217;t be epimethian for the rest of your life.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8221; i am
not sure that the solution you hinted at will ever occur to him,
however, especially since he is aware of how much you seem to prefer
avoidance. he would probably feel bad contacting you even in an
apologetic vein. and i do not think it will occur to him to
apologize&amp;#8212;i think he has a strong impression of our relationship
having been pretty painful for me as he was always there in your room
when you gave me the cold shoulder and of course never there at the
moments of our greatest intimacy. so you have to realize that to a
certain extent he usually saw us acting unhappily. if this, my
estimation, is an accurate one of his mindset (and who knows) then he
probably thinks that *you* should apologize instead.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of
course, he has to deface me so that I am less than who I am so that he
may justify in his mind the actions which he has committed. In effect,
he became not my friend so that he could get a quick lay and not feel
bad about it. Also, as much as I hated it coming from your mouth you
were right we never were friends in any traditional sense. Even when I
was noticlby feeling bad he would never approcah me and ask if every
thing was alright (as even a moderate friend would). Even, at your
prompting, when I would tell him things with out being asked he would
shrug them off and offer no support and be generally very cold about
it. I let sleeping dofs lie, and figured that he simply did not what to
get involved. I however made the mistake that he was an actual friend.
How many years has this man been apathetic towards me&amp;#8230;waiting. How
much do you wanna bet that he didn&amp;#8217;t apply to Grad school hoping that I
would leave just so he could interject himself into your pants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I
am a good person and have done him no wrong, and have done no wrong to
you that was not the result of a mutual disagreement (for which as you
have pointed out we have already both apologized for).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe
he does not understand some pretty basic things about relationships,
such as not butting into others business and that they are all
categorically painful. Even my relationship with Kerry Vineberg, which
was the most casual and whimsical one to date, hurt me and her deeply I
am sure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The oint of this is that if he is too blind or scared
to apologize and try to make amends then that means to me that he must
not want to. One of the central things we agree on, philisophically you
and I, is what I label as existentialism. Really, only actions count to
me. If he wants to apologize it will not count unless he does. I did
not make this situation, I will not be the one to unmake it any further
than I already have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not the type of bitch to bend over
and take it in the ass when my friends abandon/hurt me. I get the Fuck
out. I have seen to many of my other friends destroyed by hanging
around too long. At this point I could care less about how he feels. I
hope you understand&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8221; maybe I should tell him that both you
and i have apoligized to each other and then he would understand the
complexity of the situation. tell me what you think about this
please&amp;#8212;i won&amp;#8217;t make any move until we&amp;#8217;ve discussed it. &amp;#8220;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He
was not/is not in our relationship. Do not overstep your boundries.
Doing this would ruin any chance of ever having a resolution. My terms
are that he does not get specific guidance in this matter, and the only
person you control is yourself. Also, I do not kiss and tell, I would
prefer you do the same. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;I.E.&lt;/span&gt; if you repsect me at all, do not discuss
our relationship in any detail with any future partners. I deserve my
privacy. General situation ok, but he hardly needs that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8221;    I guess he was at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; when he thought you were in lab.  he will make a more concerted effort about that if you like. &amp;#8220;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That
is either an outright lie or an oversight. He &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KNOWS&lt;/span&gt; that lab is never
held on friday for either section. All that I ask in this last month of
Hell that I have here on campus is for me to never have to see his ugly
mug again, at least until such a time as some resoultion can be
confered, at which point the subject is once again open. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I
should be able to be free to eat at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; anytime I wish, just as he is
free to eat at Carrillo any time he wishes without me showing up to
piss him off. I want to be gentelmanly about this. He is not to eat at
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; again, period. I shall not eat at Carrillo, it is really that
simple. Another observed violation and my methods for broaching the
subjcet will be more direct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8221;    i&amp;#8217;m glad i saw you today&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me too! I hope to see yo at some point this week before the weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I
am sorry If this letter was a bit harsh. I really don&amp;#8217;t like talking
about it, but the whole &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; thing brouhgt it up again. I apologize for
the severity, but I assure you it is not one hundredth as severe as I
feel. I am sure teh same goes all around. It is funny how we mask our
feeling to get through the day. Reminds me of Los Banos or Lancaster
for some reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be Well&lt;br&gt;Anthony&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

Ok, instead of bitchin' about how much I hate Dan and how much of a
Pussy he is for taking advantage of the closest slutty girl he could
find, instead of illustrating the multitude of ways I would like to
find him at graduation with his parents and scream "Fuck You, I hope
your dick rots off and your mom eats it in front of you and you know
what she enjoys the tatse...too bad it is a one time thing!" Instead of
this I will post some of the email conversation that Syd and I have
been having.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me:&lt;br&gt;Hey All,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We
will be playing again tonight. Same deal as last time, I&amp;#8217;ll try to find
a place and then you can call me and see where I am am. Also we will
once again start at 8 and plan to go till 11. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just looking at my calander This may be our third or second to last game, so be prepared to kick some ass and take some names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope to see you there!&lt;br&gt;Tony&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syd: &lt;br&gt;Tone
I am not sure if I will be there tonight. I am really exhausted this
week and though we have so few games left I don&amp;#8217;t know if I&amp;#8217;ll make it.
Maybe I will but be prepared if I don&amp;#8217;t show up. I don&amp;#8217;t know how I got
so tired&amp;#8230; Did you go to sarah&amp;#8217;s last night? I left early I have been
tired all week. Are you eating lunch in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; at noon any time soon? I
was there on Friday expecting to see you but didn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;br&gt;SIGh&lt;br&gt;syd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me:&lt;br&gt;Syd,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ok
perhaps it is for the best. There is always a place at my table for yo
uas long as I have a table. I did not go to Sarah&amp;#8217;s last night, but
that is a long story for an email and I care not to discuss it here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I
will be at lunch at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; at noon every day this week with the possible
exception of friday. I was not there on last friday at noon which
brings me to an interesting point. I spyed a certain Cassius eating at
my Dining Common on friday. If good will is to remain in this world, I
trust this behavior will cease. Unspoken agreements mean nothing on
this campus as I have come to learn once again, so now I have committed
it to words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would like to see you, and to hang out in my
limitted time left. If, however on the off chance (though I do not
rationally believe this, yet), you are avoiding me, then please I beg
of you to tell me straight up. If you want to fully break off contact I
can accept that. No harm, no foul. I am also willing to admitt that I
am completely misreading the situation. The truth, as always, likely
lies somewhere in the middle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Know that I always think better of you in person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be Well&lt;br&gt;Anthony&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; there is a squad of ducklings in the lagoon.  Have you seen them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syd:&lt;br&gt;dear tone&lt;br&gt;yes i saw the ducklings on friday aft when i skipped my section to watch them!&lt;br&gt;actually
i skipped my section because i was tired and lazy and wound up being so
glad that i had because i saw the first ducklings of the year.&lt;br&gt;he
who must not be named ate in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; on friday? sorry, ill see about
that&amp;#8230; funny i didn&amp;#8217;t see anybody who must not be named there. unless
you mean somebody else i dont know about, erstwhile stalkers and so
forth.&lt;br&gt;you know you are not the only one to be upset about the
situation between you and he who must not be named. he who must not be
named is pretty upset about it too, and about the discomfort it causes
our friends. it is all really my responsibility&amp;#8212;it is i who should be
accused, and if there is anything i can do to resolve this between you
too i insist that you let me know.&lt;br&gt;it is not true that you were not
friends. your friendship simply did not look like any friendship i have
ever had&amp;#8212;but as another distinct individual i have no right to impose
those standards on others.&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8212;i just saw a japanese man frighten himself with his own umbrella&amp;#8230;the things you see in here&amp;#8230;&amp;#8212;&lt;br&gt;i
have however kept mum about that option you hinted at to me (vis a vis
working toward resolving situation) as you also hinted that if i did
not keep mum all options would be null and void.&lt;br&gt;what a cryptic conversation this is.&lt;br&gt;hope to see you at lunch tomorrow&amp;#8230;&lt;br&gt;i am not avoiding you although i have thought many times this week how it must appear such as we have not hung out lately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Me:&lt;br&gt;Dear Syd,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for being frank with me.  It joys my heart that you are not avoiding me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also
I owe you an extreme thanks for handling the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt;-The-One-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named-Here situation. I have been fretting
since friday trying to find a socially acceptable way to approach the
matter. I am sorry for putting you in this position and this was never
my intent. However I believe it will work better than any other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8220;he
who must not be named is pretty upset about it too, and about the
discomfort it causes our friends. it is all really my
responsibility&amp;#8212;it is i who should be accused, and if there is anything
i can do to resolve this between you too i insist that you let me know.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore,
You know that I do not belive the situation is your responsibility
(besides it wasn&amp;#8217;t in the stars, more tomorrow). Part of the
responsibility is mine, for I knew and accepted such terms to a
relationship with you. The other part is squarely his. If you are ever
in my situation (which I hope you won&amp;#8217;t be) you will understand more
directly. In fact the responsibility in this situation have very little
to do with you specifically and more with who you are abstractrly and
percieved violations to a possibly outdated code of honor which I
adhere to. I have spoken to you of this before and you know that I have
my reasons and compulsions for believing in (at least for myself)
things like monogomy etc. It pains me as well how this has affected us
all and our friends. Although I think I have trouble distiguishing this
hurt from the sadness of leaving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you for keeping mum about it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8220;it is not true that you were not friends.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;This means more to me than you know.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;i just saw a japanese man frighten himself with his own umbrella&amp;#8230;the things you see in here&amp;#8230;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;That
so reminds me of Trigun&amp;#8230;which you would love at least the first half
of&amp;#8230;actually you might like most of it. After the halfway point it
gets a little darker (which is cool for a kids show) but sadly less
slapstick. On the other hand, the second half contains way more of this
super bad ass priest character.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#8212;&gt;
I hope to see you tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be Well, Kaire&lt;br&gt;Tony&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you read all that, I salute&amp;nbsp;you.

Why is Dan Such a fucking Dork!   (&amp;lt;---Note: not a question)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I
thought we had an implicit understanding That in terms of dining
commons I would fucking eat at the far away ones (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt; and Ortega) if he
would fucking eat at the close one, Carrillo. My Schedual was thrown
off today because I had to pick up my mom from surgery and sure enough
he is fucking sitting in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLG&lt;/span&gt;. What the fuck? Un-Fuck you, Dan. Some
people have no respeto. Is he that dumb? Does he want a fucking
confrontaion with me. I half wanted to go in there and yell at him, but
since I saw him first I just went on over to Ortega. Still this really
upsets me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to kick his ass eight ways from sunday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;In all seriousness, I don&amp;#8217;t really want to hurt or kill Dan or for this to
happen to him, I just think that the world would be a better place
without asshole cowards like that in it and he should have never been
born. It is my understanding that he is an accident anways. So I say,
Un-Fuck You Dan.

&lt;br&gt;Sleceted portions from a conversation with Kerry:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(16:39:38) AvilinFaithful: Sure, In some freudian twist of events I have developed an attraction for chicks with short hair&lt;br&gt;(16:39:49) onsede: hehe&lt;br&gt;(16:39:52) onsede: i&amp;#8217;ve noticed that about you&lt;br&gt;(16:40:09) AvilinFaithful: I think it is possibly a lifestyle and world view indication as much as I am actually attracted to it&lt;br&gt;(16:40:55) onsede: i used to be kind of intimidated by girls with short hair&lt;br&gt;(16:41:11) AvilinFaithful: To be perfectly fair Jessie had long hair when we started out&amp;#8230;.but she was cuter with it short&lt;br&gt;(16:42:45)
AvilinFaithful: See to me it indicates that they might be more willing
to look at society critically than others, obviously this is gross
generalization, but it is more true than not in my experiance&lt;br&gt;(16:42:56) AvilinFaithful: I need that in a woman&lt;br&gt;(16:43:32) onsede: to me it indicates that they don&amp;#8217;t need feminine hair to feel pretty&lt;br&gt;(16:46:27) AvilinFaithful: which is surely implies that they have tried different veiw points than the normally accepted ones&lt;br&gt;(16:46:39) onsede: pretty much&lt;br&gt;(16:46:47) onsede: or that they&amp;#8217;re just above it all = P&lt;br&gt;(16:47:12) onsede: now of course, being older and wiser now i know that&amp;#8217;s not completely true&lt;br&gt;(16:48:02) AvilinFaithful: I mean the occational chick with long hair will be smokin&amp;#8217; but&amp;#8230;&lt;br&gt;(16:48:51)
AvilinFaithful: That is why I feel kinda wierd with short hair myself,
sure it is practical and everything but I am certainly not challenging
any norms with it&lt;br&gt;(16:49:29) AvilinFaithful: On the other hand, I am trying to do that in other ways now&lt;br&gt;(16:50:14) onsede: i&amp;#8217;ve always been for challenging norms in less superficial ways&lt;br&gt;(16:53:18)
AvilinFaithful: Well, but the superficial ways have a benefit. I
realize that this applies far less to you than to me at our current
points in life. But when you first get to a new place and are meeting
new people, what is gonna indicate to people that you are worth talking
to before you exchange any words? Your appearance matters a lot in
those sorts of situations&lt;br&gt;(16:54:03) AvilinFaithful: Since I am
trying to attract a certain type of person, I have to, in some sense,
accomidate my appearance top thier desires&lt;br&gt;(16:54:31) onsede: ahh&lt;br&gt;(16:54:36) onsede: see i always love the enigma though&lt;br&gt;(16:54:46) onsede: the straightlaced looking guy who does experimental music&lt;br&gt;(16:55:03) onsede: the hippy looking guy who dreams of working on wallstreet..&lt;br&gt;(16:56:19) AvilinFaithful: well, see I have changed from the second to the first now&lt;br&gt;(16:56:49) AvilinFaithful: And not really to the first&lt;br&gt;(16:57:48) AvilinFaithful: My aesthetic mind has grown/altered a lot recently and I want my appearance to reflect that&lt;br&gt;(16:58:25) AvilinFaithful: There is a certain pleasure in dressing well, too.&lt;br&gt;(17:00:05) onsede: i&amp;#8217;m wearing a button up shirt and slacks right now = P&lt;br&gt;(17:00:12) onsede: some day i may even master makeup&lt;br&gt;(17:01:29)
AvilinFaithful: I mean we have this perception that people in the
twenties dressed well not because they had the money to and thus could
show off (some of them certainly didn&amp;#8217;t) but because it was important to&lt;br&gt;(17:02:36) onsede: yeah&lt;br&gt;(17:02:43) onsede: things have really gone downhill in that regard&lt;br&gt;(17:04:15)
AvilinFaithful: It certainly has. I am trying to dress more according
to that philosophy but radical wardrobe changes are expensixve so it is
taking me longer than I&amp;#8217;d like&amp;#8230;I think my next step is&amp;nbsp;socks.

in my limited contact with her has done the same. &amp;#8220;I would love

she does respond, but we still don&amp;#8217;t do anything, Gaaah. I have decided
to wait a week before re-attempting contact. I contacted her 3 times
last week and we only did the one thing. Is a week enough? Oh well, I
am busy myself right now because of&amp;#8230;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grad School! First Texas
really wants me. Then, they say they are concerned about how my grades
took a dip Junior year (They did &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; read my personal Statement wherein
all of this was explained.) Which is essentially saying the same thing
as we don&amp;#8217;t want you (to my emotional state at least). But in the same
breath as &amp;#8220;concerned about my grades&amp;#8221; they also invited me out to texas
to tour the place. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt;. I think this trip to Austin will essentially
make or break my grad school oppertuinity next year. Which really means
that this is an interview from which I cannot go home and cry. I think
I will just have to tell them straight up why my grades fell and then
explain that those problems will go away if I move 2000 miles from
home, and then hope they have mercy on my carrer as a scientist.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Mixed Signals, Man.  Life is really weird.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

Dan has instilled in me a real hatred for him. I am experiancing feeling I
have never experiance towards anyone else. This leads to compulsions
which would give a criminal record if carried out. Being the better
person is not wholly satisfying me with regards to Dan. I dislike him
so intensely because I percieved that he has betrayed me. I think this
is a general feeling amoung my friends but I will not claim that how I
percive events is what actually went down. Dante was a large influence
on my young psyche (with other classics as well). In Inferno, one may
recall that Satan appears as a large dog with three heads one each of
our national colors. In the Maw of each head is a different corpus
screaming in eternal Agony. They are Judas, Brutus and Cassius. Judas
is obvious and Brutus and Cassius of course betrayed Julius Ceaser. As
a Jew, the meaning behind this is largely allegorical, but the meaning
is important to me. Trust is the highest quality one can have in
another person. Renegging on that trust is the largest offence. Notice
how those in the worst damnation all committed crimes against their
fellow humans, while mere atheists were all chillin' over starbucks in
Limbo. Fuck Dan Stuart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Syd confuses me. I love her. I think she
is a good person; in general. She did me no great betrayl like Dan.
However she did lie to me if not explicitly then by withholding
information through a semantic cop out. It will take time for me to
forgive her, but today she did apologize which goes a long way in my
book. I might even be able to let Dan back into my gaming group after
his dishonorable actions if he were to apologize on his own free
willrather than smugly thinking he has done no wrong while Janus-like
trying to prevent me from being hurt by the damage he has done. Still
sometimes Syd pisses me off since she is not wholly removed from guilt
in the matter. She is irrationally, incredibly stubborn. Once she takes
a stance on something she will not waver from it ever. She cannot even
be persuaded to think about other options once she has taken a stance.
Even if every other option has a better outcome for her she will not
think about it for weeks or months after the fact. She is Epimethius
Incarnate on some issues. It isn&amp;#8217;t just big emotionally charged issues
either, it can be small stupid things. This was the source of much
conflict in our relationship. If she was as grown up as I would expect
a hyper-analytic person to be in this manner we would not have had half
the problems we did. Not that we all don&amp;#8217;t go through simmilar things
ocassionally. However, recently all of those sorts of things in me I
was consiously using as a way to control my depression so as not to go
off the deep end while my family was in crisis. I even explained this
to Syd many times. Somehow I don&amp;#8217;t think she ever really accpeted that
for a time I had to be sad no matter what else was going on. Our
breakup is a perfect example of syd doing something that with some
thought could have been avoided and a better result for everyone would
have resulted. I think she just wanted us to have a better
relationship, and really who can blame a girl for that. Just don&amp;#8217;t go
with the first random solution. As much as I want to break Dan&amp;#8217;s
kneecaps, I think the pain of knowing he actually is incapable of real,
true friendship may be enough suffering for that maggot infested crap
pile. See, my first compulsion would have been bad for me ^_^&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#8212;&gt;
Now,
Terrorism. Paul Krassner back in the sixties had &amp;#8220;Fuck Communism&amp;#8221;
Posters printed up and sold. They were offensive, but to whom? If
anyone dared to ask him to remove the sign, he would shout them down by
saying that they were soft on Communism. It worked on anyone, police
included. Most Decency-In-The-Media people were the same ones who used
anti-communism propoganda to create blacklists and the like. &amp;#8220;Fuck
Communism&amp;#8221; was a brilliant move. There is a story of some high school
student who for the graduation pictutre pulled out a &amp;#8220;Fuck Communism&amp;#8221;
poster at the last moment. Since the school could not simpily white out
the word Fuck &amp;#8212; leaving only Communism &amp;#8212; they whited out the whole
poster and there is a funny student holding a white sign in the final
version of this grad picture. Terrorism is the new Communism, so I
thought it worked. I hope to make a Fuck Terrorism poster and flash it
at Paul Krassner when I go to see him in&amp;nbsp;June.

So yeah, I went out to the apartment last night to visit Shawn. We tried
to take a bus downtown but we missed it. Instead we stayed at his place
and saved a bunch of money by making drinks there. I cannot tell you
what I had to drink last night. Actually this might be a funn exercise,
I&amp;#8217;ll try.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Half a beer&lt;br&gt;A shot of Whiskey&lt;br&gt;Coke with two shots of rum + lime.&lt;br&gt;Caipeirosca (that is totally misspelled, it is a really good brazillian drink)&lt;br&gt;Another half a beer&lt;br&gt;Another Shot of Whiskey&lt;br&gt;A Shot of whiskey in a back alley way&lt;br&gt;and a Shot of Whiskey to finish it off.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This
is good, it helps me predict when I&amp;#8217;ll be sober again. But yeah, Pretty
early on, Syd came and joined us and then when we were about to leave
the house to go to a ba and walk down &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DP&lt;/span&gt; I made Jon leave his Woman
(World of Warcraft) and come with us. Unfortunately &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUCKS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASS&lt;/span&gt;. It
was 11:40 and the bars had already given last call. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt;! It just meant
I saved more money. In any event, we went on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DP&lt;/span&gt; (I was far and wide the
most shickered btw). Obeying the Scopatz principle of Equishittynessall
music was equally bad. However there were two crappy live bads. For the
record, I really enjoyed myself at the time. Howevere much the two
bands were alike in shittyness, the second band had a far better
drummer. So I liked those guys more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the key to getting
to the point where you are kinda out of it is not just a lot of booze
but also the will power. Also I am pretty certain that not drinking
water really until you are done drinking helps a lot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw
Duncan Neilsen Last Night! He goes to City College and we totally ran
into each other on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DP&lt;/span&gt;. Syd knows Nick so I introduced her. What is with
getting tipsey and then seeing people from my past.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am
secretly hoping that I can get inebriated enough that I can then induce
a high that will resemble a drug trip. I can already kind of do this
with more (un)natural stimuli. The occassional movie will be so far out
that by though some process of enchantment I can induce a faux-high.
Last night was the first time where I felt this sort of
conncertion/release-of-self was possible after having imbibed.
Typically I in some sense feel dulled. Not this Time! I&amp;#8217;ll have to
perfect my methodology&amp;#8230;maybe I need to get kinda out of it and then
watch 200 Motels or Tetsuo: The Iron Man. I&amp;#8217;ll find something that
works. I really wanna experiance a Paul Krassner type &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSD&lt;/span&gt; trip. Ya know
people&amp;#8217;s heads turning into rainbows and fun things like that. However
due to a strict moral code, I feel it is wrong to do illegal drugs
while they are illegal. Civil Disobediance and all that. Unfortunately
I don&amp;#8217;t think people will take to the streets in droves of protests
just so I can drop Acid. There is always Amsterdam. Just don&amp;#8217;t think of
David Bowie when you go there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All right Peace&amp;nbsp;out

So I went out hitting the bars &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; clubs in Santa Barbara last night with Shawn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Man
was that fun. It turns out I really like the two drinks I ordered: A
White Russian and a shot of Don Julio tequilla with salt and a lime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By far the best music I heard was when I put a buck into the Juke Box.  My Playlist?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZZ&lt;/span&gt; Top - Cheap Sunglasses&lt;br&gt;James Brown - Papa&amp;#8217;s got a Brand New Bag&lt;br&gt;Frank Sinatra - Forget Domanni (sp?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By
Far the Sinatra was the most danceable music I heard for the entire
night. This makes me really look forward to spending Christmas in Las
Vegas. My family and the Rowes are planning on meeting up there. I
wanna go get drunk in a lounge casino bar with my cousins and listen to
Jazz malet ensemble or Sinatra Cover band. That would be bliss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In
other news, last night I ran into my friends Tanya and Irene. That
first time was fine. The second time reminded me of Neil Young&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;The
Needle and The Damage Done.&amp;#8221; Here he says that &amp;#8220;Every Junkie is like a
Setting Sun.&amp;#8221; Tanya was about as wasted as I have ever seen a friend
and Irene was more on top of things but that was because she had just
thrown up every drink she had that night. So one was super drunk and
one was just sad. I could type the whole saga, but really, why bother?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cheers!
