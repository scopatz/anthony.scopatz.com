  <div class="entry-content"><p>/begin&nbsp;Rant</p>
<p>I was rudely awoken this morning to the sound of jack hammers after a
mere 4 hours of sleep. But this time it was <span class="caps">NOT</span> from my pool area which
is being removed and worked on. It was the from the guy&#8217;s unit who
*happens* to be the <span class="caps">HOA</span> Treasurer who lives one down and over from me.
Let&#8217;s call him Dan, for various reasons (none of which being his actual&nbsp;name).</p>
<p>Background: Our <span class="caps">HOA</span> needs a good bit of work since the prior property
manager company was screwing up. The pool needs to come out, the fences
and railings need to be replaced or painted, and a bunch of stuff was
damaged in the hail storm. Dan boldly stepped forward in order to get
this stuff done. To cover these extra expenses Dan has assessed an
additional one-time payment of $1400 to cover these&nbsp;expenses.</p>
<p>This past weekend the pool was being jack hammered away and is still not
done. Thus when I was awoke to these sounds I thought that our little
treasurer had some double dipping going&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>I went down to investigate. I asked the worker at Dan&#8217;s place when the
work was going to be done and he said three days. It should be noted
that the worker appeared to be the same who was working on the pool this
past weekend. Same height, same skin tone, eye <span class="amp">&amp;</span> hair color, and both
had&nbsp;mustaches.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">So I sent out this message of inquiry:</div>
<div class="line">Dear *Dan* and other <span class="caps">PSC</span> owners,</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
A couple of points have been brought to my attention:</blockquote>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1) The same man (didn&#8217;t catch his name but is short, Chicano, and has</div>
</div>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: <span class="caps">WARNING</span>/2 (<tt class="docutils">/home/scopatz/anthony.scopatz.com/content/missives/did-you-know-the-difference-between-inquiry-and-accusation.rst</tt>, line&nbsp;41)</p>

<p>a mustache) is doing both the work on the complex as a whole and on
Brian&#8217;s personal unit (#13).
|  2) This man was jack-hammering inside of *Dan*&#8217;s property.
|  3) A door knob key holder of the type real estate agents use to place
on properties is on your&nbsp;unit.</p>

This brings up a number of questions I would like you to field, please.</blockquote>

<p>How many more days will work internal to your property be performed, and
at what times? Furthermore, I am requesting a financial disclosure of
<span class="caps">PSC</span> to ensure that no finances are accidentally mixed between our
communal projects and your personal ones. Moreover, are you planning on
selling soon? Also could you please explain the decision to remove the
pool weeks before the meeting when it was stated and implied in previous
emails that discussion of the pool area and region would be held at the
June 7th meeting? In general, the timeline given in the notification of
assessment does not seem to be held to as you are already working, could
you could also address this&nbsp;please?</p>
<blockquote>
Thank you for taking to time to respond to these questions. I am sure</blockquote>

<p>it will dissuade any fears I and others may have. You can rest assured
that I will be at the June 7th&nbsp;meeting.</p>

<p>Mostly because I sent this out to all of the other owners and I don&#8217;t
value him, and I am being defamatory and accusatory, and I don&#8217;t have my
facts straight,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>As it turns out most of my fears were mislaid, which is why I wrote the
email in the first place. The worker who was working on the pool seems
to have a soul patch in addition to the mustache. This was hard to tell
since he had a gas mask on all&nbsp;weekend.</p>
<p>Dan, meanwhile is schizophrenic in his demands. He wants to be
gentlemanly and civil about this, but would then tell me that I
&#8220;disgust&#8221; him and that I &#8220;should just cut him a damn&nbsp;check.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a property manager/treasurer this guy blows! I remained calm
throughout the discussion and insisted that it was just an inquiry and
not an allegation, even though he kept demanding that I was defaming&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>The real kicker is <span class="caps">HE</span> <span class="caps">DIDN</span>&#8217;T <span class="caps">EVEN</span> <span class="caps">READ</span> <span class="caps">MY</span> <span class="caps">EMAIL</span>! The guy who he hired to
be his property manager, call him Bob, called him and told him what I
had&nbsp;written.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit, it may have been wrong to send the email out to all of the
owner&#8217;s initially (but this is still sort of iffy since it relates to
their investments). However, I don&#8217;t think asking for financial
disclosure and addressing concerns is&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>After I got the full story I wrote a full apology and explanation to all
of the owners again allaying my concerns and&nbsp;fears.</p>
<p>Basically I don&#8217;t think what I did or wrote or said was racist, or lazy,
or insulting in any way. I understand how someone attacking me would
construe it as&nbsp;such.</p>
<p><strong>So my question for <span class="caps">YOU</span> is do you think what I wrote was an inquiry or
an accusation, in both the legal and intra-personal&nbsp;senses?</strong></p>
